Yeah, uhh
And so it seems that I'm sewing jeans
And 1st and 15th is just a sewing machine
So I cut the pattern and I sew its seams
And button in this hustling then publicly I'm Buddy Lee
There's no busting them and cuffing them is like
Ushering in the regime, they want me to make Prince pants
But I withstand, I ain't gotten into that
A little big in the waist, two-pocket on the back
Call them Lu-vi's, old jeans covered in blue dye
Give 'em the game, that's like giving chocolate to the fat
Look: how you think I got here?
That's the same game that came through where I lived as a kid
In the bad luck truck and threw boxes off the back
Made me a ripper, deliver like river
Content a little more thicker, slicker
Yeah, and they said oil and water don't mix
Now they all down at the beach washing off the fish
Was Blackbeard till I brought the Roc into your ships, YEAH!

It's my life, my life, everything I do I do for you
I do it all for you, everything I say, you know it's the truth
I'll say it is the truth, I'll take all the pressure off of you
Take pressure off of you, I'll take, the pressure off of you

YEAH!
Uhh, it's hella proper (proper)
Cause it sag so low you can see boxer, like a boxer's
That's the way that the Family's pants worn
Don't be sly and try and put 'em on
The stones in the pocket'll drag you down to Davy Jones' locker
Beware if you wanna rock the Knickerbocker
Other nigga from the block what, they was selling O's
Like Wheel of Fortune, of imported cocaine
Just to feel important, it was "Do or Die"
They was tired of being "Po' Pimps," not for sure
That was just a product of my common sense
I guess, I was just guessing like the consonants
Momma said beware of what the devil do
Tell 'em that your soul's not for sale like the W's
So go ahead and pirate, the highest
Cannons make you leak like pirated my shh
It's no shh.. it's just shh like quiet
And big homie's out of retirement, nigga

It's my life, my life, everything I do I do for you
I do it all for you, everything I say you know it's the truth
I'll say it is the truth, I'll take all the pressure off of you
Take pressure off of you, I'll take, the pressure off of you

Uhh.. Young, uhh
So the pen is mightier than the sword, my Lord
My first picture was a line-up, now I'm on the Forbes (uhh)
And I still remain the artiste through thees all
If you force my hand I'll be forced to "draw" (hahaha)
If the war calls for Warhols
Hope you got enough space on your hall's walls
I make niggas murals, then escape the Bureau's investigation
Out in Europe on vacation
I'm back for these puppies with the pound boy (RRRRA)
Here's a round boy (RRRRA, RRRRA), down boy
Sound boy, you don't wanna soundclash loud noise
Leave niggas paranoid if not paralyzed
Which means you can't walk in my shoes
Too much green you can't talk in my hue
Extend the team, nigga holla at Lu'
1st and 15th, that's my cue, I'm through

It's my life, my life, everything I do I do for you
I do it all for you, everything I say you know it's the truth
I'll say it is the truth, I'll take all the pressure off of you
Take pressure off of you, I'll take, the pressure off of you

Little rapper turn it out because I'm very plugged
I convert, I can work anywhere in the world
You can ask my brother Hugg
He'll concur that I'm serious with the words
To the man up above, thank you very much
That I got what I got and I'm at where I'm at
Like an "a" in a circle, with a pay, lil Urkel
What they say when they see lil G
From the F to the F with the amazing verbals
While they race in a circle like they racing a gerbil
I race in a circle like I'm racing a horse
I'm racing a Porsche, while they racing in place
They race in a cage, I race on a course
'Course, that case in the court did not defer the dream
I am still a raisin in the sun, raging against the machine

Beyond clean, in phenom jeans, little rap Isaac Asimov
I let my momma in the rhyming that she raised me off
A 80s baby on fire like a safety off
Got my hood riding higher than some 28s
Off of everything I spoke like a 84
And they in love with him and I'm in love with them
And we'll never ride dubs again, no we won't

I got a little bit of money fillin' my pockets
Roll around like I run this shit
I got a system filled up with toxins
I've been broken-hearted, now it's fuck that bitch
Getting high to deal with my problems
Fucking bitches, getting drunk as shit
But these bitches getting obnoxious
They nothin' to me though I love this shit
Go long days, longer nights
Talk too much, the wrong advice
All the lights and call my life
Doctor, doctor, will you help me?
Get me healthy
Keep it low, this where hell be
Ain't shit you can tell me now
Fuck this rap shit, bitch, I'm sellin' out
Ooh shit, with my new bitch you jealous now
Smokin' weed at the crib watching Belly now
All the pain that they causin'
Like, fuck it, we ballin'
Now everythin' straight
You feeling the feeling
I'm chilling, just living
I'm burning away
Conversations we having
I'm getting too static
Too much on my plate
Lord, I need me a break

But I'll be good by the weekend
I'll be good by the weekend
Everything good by the weekend
Everything will be good by the weekend

We going out tonight, yeah we going out tonight, like fuck it
We going out tonight, yeah we going out tonight, fuck it
We going out tonight, yeah we going out tonight
We going out tonight, yeah we going out tonight

I been having trouble sleeping
Battling these demons
Wondering what's the thing that keeps me breathing
Is it money, fame or neither?
I been thinking about the places that I frequent
All the people that I see
I’m just out here livin' decent
What do it mean to be a G?
And all the time we fall behind
Bitches in the concubine
I call her mine, crazy
She ain't' God as I
I make water wine
Pause in time
It's common, they often hate me
Never will I walk in line
I cross the T's and dot the I's
Wondering, well, wonderin' how I got this high
Fell asleep and forgot to die, God damn
I'm poppin' them downers
And drinkin' them powders, faded
Get it over the counter
I'm stuck on the browsers
Like, how did I make it?
These bitches don't know me
This shit is so lonely until she get naked
Don't even know what today is

But I'll be good by the weekend
I'll be good by the weekend
Everything good by the weekend
Everything will be good by the weekend

Mondays I think of you, but I ain’t tripping on it
Tuesdays I’m in, gotta get my hands up on ya
Wednesdays I live with you, you know you're staying over
Thursdays I’m sick of you, I got to get rid of you
Cause Fridays are always
The start of the time of my life, alright
When I get faded you hate it
But, baby, it’s gon be alright, ha, alright
Some people, oh, whoa, oh-oh...
Yeah, people say, people, oh-oh, say...

People love you when they on your mind
A thought is love's currency
And I been thinking 'bout her all the time
I've never seen somebody put together perfectly
What do I have to do to call you mine?
Someone like you is so hard to find
You can open up your eyes, or you can walk it blind
All I ask is that you hurry, I won't hurt you, don't you worry
Listen to me, I'ma set you free
He ain't gonna break your heart again
Go through the worst to reach the ecstasy
When your imagination's on pretend
I never thought that it would feel this way
You never taught me how to heal the pain
I wish you caught me on a different day
When it was easier to be happy

Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away? Can you hide away?
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange, how the times have changed
I wish we could go and be free once, baby, you and me
We could change the world forever
And never come back again
Let's leave it all in the rear view
Let's leave it all in the rear view
You don't have to cry, you don't have to cry

Mend a broken heart, girl, if you can
I don't expect you to be capable
You got the world right in your hands
And that responsibility is unescapable
I promise that I'll be a different man
Please give me the chance to go and live again
I'm having some trouble, can you give a hand?
It seems perfection really is so unattainable
Don't even say you 'bout to end it all
Your life precious, ain't no need to go and kill yourself
I'm not so sure that there's an end at all
I wish the truth would just reveal itself
Who do you call to make it to the top?
And who do you call to make the shooting stop?
And who do you call to give the coupe a wash?
After everything I did, I think I'm still myself

Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away? Can you hide away?
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange, how the times have changed
I wish we could go and be free once, baby, you and me
We could change the world forever
And never come back again
Let's leave it all in the rear view
Let's leave it all in the rear view
You don't have to cry, you don't have to cry
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Macadelic
Motherfucker, hahahahah

I got codeine in my cup, you can bet your ass I'm sipping
Groupies fall in love, I'm like bitch you must be tripping
I'm just tryna fuck and she just need tuition
Why you tryna stunt, you need to play your own position
Never gave a fuck and nothing 'bout me changed
Still roll up them blunts, got diamonds in my chain
Yeah, you heard me I got diamonds in my chain
But it don't make a difference if you crying in the rain
Two hundred shows, I'mma kill more, I just sold out that Fillmore
Got a million, make a mil more, play a number one spot on the Billboard

Yeah, people lie, numbers won't
Keep me high, drugs is close
Roll one up, pour a cup
Watch the world go up in smoke

I like my music real loud, real loud
Can you turn that shit up for me right now, right now
Here it come, there it go, ask your homies, ask your hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low
I like my music real loud, real loud
Can you turn that shit up for me right now, right now
Here she comes, there she goes, never chasing after hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low

I'mma get that Grammy soon, fuck your magazine
Jordan gonna hand me shoes, still fuck your magazine
Hammer team, in that pack with me
Hear that Jerm beat banging, with a glass of lean
When I went to every high school class would be
Tryna fuck the female faculty
I'm a crazy little fucker, think my head done ran away
I experiment with drugs but I won't ever fuck with yay'
I just made a million dollars, still I think I'm underpaid
Fuck with me? Kid no way, when you meet me, bitch stand up straight
Pump out raps, yeah I got raps, tryna talk shit what you think about that?
For the pesos, getting bank rolls, I'mma lay low chill, 'til I let that stack

Yeah, people lie, numbers won't
Keep me high, drugs is close
Roll one up, pour a cup
Watch the world go up in smoke

I like my music real loud, real loud
Can you turn that shit up for me right now, right now
Here it come, there it go, ask your homies, ask your hoes
If you didn't, now you know,never keep your pockets low
I like my music real loud, real loud
Can you turn that shit up for me right now, right now
Here she comes, there she goes, never chasing after hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low
Hey! Ayo, Sap! What's good, bruh?
This man is kinda high over here

Ayo, the flyest motherfucker in the room, yeah, you know it's me
Bitches hatin' on him ‘cause he started out here locally
Hopefully I'll be at the top soon
For now I'm at my house on the couch watchin' cartoons
You know how much you love it when you get it in abundance
Give a fuck about a budget
When you always be the subject of discussion
But it's nothin' when you stop and just say fuck it
‘Cause you walkin' out in public
And you hear them talkin' rubbish
I just wanna ride, ride through the city in a Cutlass
Find a big butt bitch somewhere, get my nuts kissed
That's the way it goes when you party just like I do
Bitches on my dick that used to brush me off in high school

Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?
Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?

We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
That's why all my bitches bad
They see this crazy life I have and they in awe
We gonna win, you can take the lose or draw
What I'm in got these hoes who used to play me in they bras
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
Take over the world, watch these haters get mad
That's why all my bitches bad
They see this crazy life I have
Hop into the car and then we take them to the pad, it's a wrap

And motherfuckers think they know me, but they never met the kid
Style come with excellence and money make benevolence
Irrelevant for the fuckers who never been intelligent
I kill my Henny, break the bottle for the hell of it
Tell a bitch that she better bring a friend
And if she want an autograph she better bring a pen
Yeah, the party never end, this life is what I recommend
And if you got a ho picked for me, then she better be a 10
I ain't picky, but these girls be actin' tricky
When the situation's sticky and the liquor got 'em silly

But I take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?

We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
That's why all my bitches bad
They see this crazy life I have and they in awe
We gonna win, you can take the lose or draw
What I'm in got these hoes who used to play me in they bras
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
Take over the world, watch these haters get mad
That's why all my bitches bad
They see this crazy life I have
Hop into the car and then we take them to the pad, it's a wrap
Think I can see a fucking halo, about to meet my maker
Brought a double cup of Drano, some soda for the flavor
Uncontrollable behavior with some psychopathic tendencies
Lonely as your neighbors with the bitches
He got special needs
Word to my denim fiends, I'm Kennedy on ecstasy
My flavor from the nature, need an acre for my recipe
They got my soul, but I don't let 'em take the rest of me
My melody, a little like Kenny G's, it's heavenly
And my denim tailored, me and Action rapping
Al be fucking with the fader, sipping mind eraser
Actually, we rapping for the fuck of it
Taking money from you, gonna smack you out in public
We the Republican government, abundance of substance
Having consumption to fuck a bitch
You're Banana Republic fit, go suck a dick!
And your bitch looking like Cousin Itt, the ugliest

I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit
Groupie bitches wild enough to suck a baby's dick
Cadillacs is getting whipped a hundred eighty fifth
Just for that sizzle, Gore-Tex in case of drizzle

I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit
Looking up into the clouds where the angels sit
They looking down, keeping watch 'til I'm dead
So how'd I get this red dot on my head?

Yo, I don't perform unless the money's in my pocket first
After rapping take my people out for octopus
We all deserve it; dedication to the fam
Don't hold your hand out for nothing
If you claim to be my man, damn
You see me peeling off a whip like when your mother strip
Blow the dice, roll them chips, hit another trip
Shit, I'm on some shit
Hand's fucking hotter than a leather in the 6 in the summertime
Understand I'm only rhyming for this son of mine
And so my daughter can be a lawyer and reap the spoils
We ate the tuna, it's suede puma
My look is Jay Buhner, dawggy
‘Cause some of us just age sooner
I'm still twisted, rocking lizards from a strange river
Forbidden jungle in the joint paper, point shaver
Check the bio, I fixed the game
Between Kentucky and Miami of Ohio, I been wild


Bitch I'm nodding off, I'm hot as wasabi sauce
And constantly giving y'all a bit of this ambiance
I was a minor, chasing after vagina
None of my friends were fake, but none of my clothes designer
Went from posted on stoops to smoking on roofs
I came from that basement, now look at this view
Making this money, blowing it all
Fuck what you did, just show me results

Yo, I'm a 635 dipper, fly mothafucka
Leather to the foot, horses, I lead 'em to the brook
If you locked, then keep the chisel in the book
I see a lion in the mirror when I look
Look, I lose money, but I make it back
I keep it true and ain't no mothafuckin' faking that
I get a fade and then I fade to black
Bet on the Razorbacks
I hold the multi-colored flavored gat – blat!

I said it must be the drugs, I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs, I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs, I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs, I said it must be the drugs

You was Easy Mac with the cheesy raps
Who the fuck is Mac Miller?
This name says "Crack dealing trap nigga slash cap peeler
Back with a black stripper
Ass thicker than a snack wrap snicker, too fat to snap zippers"
In half is what I'll do to Mac Miller
Now my mind's first track figured
A nigga who treats his yak richer than elixir, taps liquor
Then pass 'til it goes around the room, like his casket finna
Oh, you Mac Miller?
The fact's filtered in the snapped picture
My man Jack ripped over Google like Jack the Ripper
You who I'm finna murder, this brunette bitch
Get pumped like a flat fixed to become a flat fixture
A rap figure that look like you hacked Twitter
I'll show you, Beastie Boy
You can't match your killer with that wigger
I'd rather attack Tigger or Jack Thriller
He got track fillers for a album
If he had Jigga on an ad-sticker
Wouldn't go cat litter where I'm from, Malcolm
I knock the thoughts off your balcony, King
You're from a home of funny bones
Not like quite the one I've known
You look like, before you punched in flows
You were strucking blows, bloody nose for your honey rolls
In the lunchroom gettin' yo money stole
You're a bully's Best Day Ever with them Nike's on your feet
Coming through Blue Slide Park
I'm gon' rob this chump
On a party on Fifth Ave like he Donald Trump
Nigga, give me that shit!
I liked you better when you was Easy Mac with the cheesy raps – who the fuck is Mac Miller?
It's the, rap diablo, macho when I drop flows
Bar gets raised up, it's me and Petey Pablo
Colder than gazpacho, colder than the mono
Rapping head honcho, rocking shows like I was Bono
I go play a couple keys on the piano
The industry a lie, all the promises were hollow
Follow me I could show you where we be's at
How'd I get my g pass, none of your fucking beeswax
These raps bring a joint together like a kneecap
Fuck the little 8 balls, show me where the ki's at
The time continuum, Mortal Kombat finish them
Tryna find a balance reaching from my equilibrium
Fools I pity them, I'm not a human I'm amphibian
Fake superhero like the Mystery Men
I ain't saving nothin'
I'm gettin' faded 'till the angels come and skipping all the famous functions
How do the famous function?
The A list can't be trusted
I strong arm them like I play the trumpet
The bottom barrel of society
I tell my bitch if she don't love me then just lie to me
I'm finer than the winery
Take it from the rich this is piracy (piracy)
Finally, I don't even need my fucking eyes to see
Come and die with me

Cause everybody got dead homies
Said everybody got dead homies
Said everybody got dead homies
Said everybody got dead homies

Uh, okay
My mind is Yoda I'm on Ayatollah
These other rapper just a diet soda
I find Jehova in the darkest places
Empty as apartment basements
This a marathon gentlemen go ahead and start the races
Save the coffin spaces
Don't come up missing
Tell your bitch that you've been trippin' now you on vacation
Rapping like it's automated
Lights I keep em' on like Vegas
Love I'm making so hot I'm turning hog to bacon
Only God can save him, I heard the monsters made him
I ain't a star I'm way farther with the constelations
Contemplating suicide like it's a DVD
Lost inside my mind it's a prison homie leave me be
You can see me bleed, I be with the freaks and geeks
Bitch I never miss a beat, I'm Charlie Conway, triple deke
Gordon Bombay in these streets
Ballin' like I'm Pistol Pete
Been a beast, every word I spit rewriting history
Look at what you did to me, look at what you did to me
Running to the underworld with guns and set the sinners free
No bitches in my circle I'm a show you the commercial
I've been popping like a kernel
Reading Justin Beiber's journal
Treat you like a urinal
Close your eyes...

So watch her do the Macarena, somewhere out by Pasadena
Love a drug that everybody here just tryna get a taste of
You a waste of the space that you take up
Livin', this time around I'm not kiddin'
I had an intuition about these women
And suspicion got me lookin' at you different
How a man in my position can't start slippin' down these slopes
'Cause it's all just (downhill from there)
As a kid I didn't learn that, but (now I'm aware)
When you a youngin
You just tryna live your life and have some fun
In a world where you have yet to see how evil it's become
It's hard to have a dream when you deep inside of one
And I know you hate them spirits so I keep em in my lungs
I'm a Beatle to these young kids
But sometimes I be feelin' like a needle to these young kids
You had the world, you about to leave it to these young kids
And we gonna show you what the love is...

Stay high, go for what you know
Let it in your mental and don't ever let it go
It won't stop!

You can't fight the feeling, feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no (it won't stop!)
You can't fight the feeling, feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no

Uh, and I keep a couple Most Dope homies by me
So there ain't too many times it's me, myself and Irene
We stay smokin' through the night wake up, do some tai-chi
Homie can't you see I'm chillin? Please don't fuck up my chi
Yeah my jacket Y-3, recently been up on fashion
Waste a bunch of money, kinda stinks of sastisfaction
Fell asleep in Hollywood, woke up in Manhattan
Ballin' like I'm Jordan, but I'm fresh as Mars Blackmon
A penny for your thoughts, a dollar for your dreams
A price on an idea, we never can agree
They tell you what to know, but it's better to believe
So why you tryna act like what you never gonna be?
Still I tell em, "Fuck what you know, I'm feelin' comfortable"
Just continue livin' life, cause enough of 'em don't
You spent your days countin' every single penny made
Restart now, cause we comin' for you anyways

Stay high, go for what you know
Yeah, Macadelic...
Let it in your mental and don't ever let it go
It ain't never gon' stop cause

You can't fight the feeling, feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no
I told you it won't stop cause
You can't fight the feeling, feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no

Sometimes I wake up, up in the morning, make up
Wipe the smudge of makeup off my bed
Soon as she’s gone and take up
Hours out my day just to find power shit to say
But you won't hear it
Even if your ears was pierced with Beats by Dre
I mean the sun is slowly falling, we all surely should die eventually
So what's your calling? Oh you left your phone behind?
Identity crises break mirrors, vices steer us through wickedness
Jesus Christ is right near us and Devil said you owe ten percent
Sold your soul, I know, sold your soul and you're hopeless
My focus, stare at elopin' on boats that float in the open
Of oceans that coast the line on the margins I rhyme, choking
Or soaking up game, I'm hoping you picked the second one
Change the emotion of jealousy that you're holding
You're telling me that you're golden but really cubic zirconia
Let me see, I'll break you down like a pound of fire, whenever
Your tactics are mighty clever but even if you Mayweather, you

You can't fight the feeling, feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no (it won't stop!)
You can't fight the feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no

(women moaning)
Hallelujah, thank God I have a future
Praying I don't waste it getting faded
Cause I'm smoking *censored* 'til I'm coughing up tar
Through the surge, energy curve like a lumbar
I don't act hard, I still read Babar
Tripping out, looking at a bunch of Google map stars
Shit, they got a app for... that

But me, I'm still trapped inside my head
It kinda feel like it's a purgatory
So polite and white, but I got family who would murder for me
Think I'm living paradise, so would I have to worry 'bout?
Dealing with these demons, feel the pressure
Find the perfect style
Making sure my mom and dad are still somewhat in love
All these backfires of my experiments with drugs
And I experience the touch of my epiphany in color form
The difference between love and war inform me
I'm above the norm
But, give me anybody though, I'll gladly chew his face off, them bath salts
Rhyming like it's summertime on asphalt, hot
Haven't picked a major label, think I'm blackballed
I still don't got the heart to pick my phone up when my dad calls
Will he recognize his son when he hears my voice?
I put this music against my life, I think I fear the choice
And I don't know what I'm running from, but I'm running still
I conversate with acquaintances, but it's nothing real
I'm from a city that you hear and think a bunch of steel
So a hundred mills wouldn't make me sign a fucking deal
Money kills, that's the truth, it's called the root of evil
But I want that Rolls Royce that the homie Lennon drove
So, if you ain't talking 'bout some money I'mma send you home
Unconventional, special but unprofessional
Adolescent expression that's letting me meet these centerfolds
As troubles fill my mind capacity, I let 'em go
If I was Johnny Depp in Blow, I would let it snow
That's just me all wilding out and being extra doe

And if God was a human, it'd be yours truly, watching horror movies
With some foreign groupies, thinking this decor suits me
I do drugs to get more loopy, I'm in tune
To ancient jujitsu spirituals, it's blissful
Looking out as far as eyes can see
I'm glad that me and this elevation could finally meet
I think I'm JFK's final speech
They try assassinating all of my beliefs
But I'm asleep so whisper to me for some peace of mind
And he be high some weed to grind on top a Jesus shrine
Twenty thousand on my watch cause I needed time
If y'all would leave me the fuck alone, that'd be divine
Can't decide if you like all the fame
Three years ago to now, it's just not the same
I'm looking my window ashing on the pane
Shit, wonder if I lost my way

Don't you ever wanna hide away
Poseidon triumph in the eyes of rain
Won't give a fuck about tomorrow if I die today
I'll greet the devil with a smiling face
Shit, that God fellow may reside in space
As, time's a wasting I'm freebasing with Freemasons
My girl's switching the locks, the keys keep changing
Dreaming of places, my own personal creations
If there's a party in heaven I plan to leave wasted
Retracing my steps way back to Biblical times
We-we all gon' end up meeting at the finishing line

And these words that I command you today shall be in your heat
And you shall teach them diligently to your children
And you shall speak of them when you sit at home
And when you walk along the way, and when you lie down
And when you rise up, I am the lord, your god
Uh, $ign
Oh no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no ($ign)
Aye—

I been waitin' all night for this moment
I been waitin' all year for this moment
I been picturing you takin' off your clothes for me

You in my dreams, that's why I sleep all the time
Just to hear you say I love you, just to touch you
Just to leave you behind
I told you, you don't have to worry, you'll be fine
The type of thing I heard it happen all the time
Yeah, I just wanna see you fly
Because your fragrance got me faded, you be keepin' me high
Said nothin' better than the first time
I'll be at your service like the check-in at the curbside
You don't have to spend another second on this Earth dry
Wet you like a rebel, go a second and a third time
Left you up a verse mind
And when you hungry, I can chef you up a stir fry
Get you some dessert wine, elevate  yah third eye
First prize, Nobel, get a piece
Your clothes off, turn around, let me see

Tell your little friends you gon' be alright
Girl I got a plan for the whole night

Yeah, okay I came up with a plan, it was take you by the hand
And bring you somewhere where the sand is
Soon as we landed
We went straight into the room
And played the music, started dancing
You was taking off your pants
It look like Dorothy ain't in Kansas anymore
I do you like a chore
We started on the bed and then we moved it to the floor
You started getting crazy, told me fuck you like a whore
I thought you was an angel, now you yellin' to the Lord
You used to tell me all the time I ain't your type
Now you always wanna spend the night
Now I'm doing everything you like
When I'm inside your pussy, damn it feels so right
Yeah, but I still respect the game
Every time I'm out of line you always set me straight
The sex is great, for Heaven's sake I need it every day
I yell your name, Cinderella
Never gonna find nobody better, all my life...

Well, I been meanin' to tell you

Under the weather

Said, you know I know who you really are, ain't need to lie
Said, the universe couldn't keep us apart
Why would it even try?
Yeah, said, don't let them hurt you ever
I know you far too smart
Before things come together, they have to fall apart
It's been a while since I've been sober
This life can be so hard, I'd rather talk about you

Said, you just don't know how beautiful you are
And baby that's my favorite part
You walk around so clueless to it all
Like nobody gonna break your heart
It'll be alright babe, see, me, I got you covered
I'm gon' be your lover, you might be the one
If it's only tonight, ayy, we don't need to worry
We ain't in a hurry, rushin' into love

If you wanna stay, we're taking it slow baby
Cause you and me, and I got enough on my mind
But I can make some time for something so divine

Said, you just don't know how beautiful you are
And baby that's my favorite part
You walk around so clueless to it all
Like nobody gonna break your heart
It'll be alright babe, see, me, I got you covered
I'm gon' be your lover, you might be the one
If it's only tonight, ayy, we don't need to worry
We ain't in a hurry, rushin' into love
People worship these idols, 'til they come in contact with Gods

Won't get Hall of Fame dick from a minor league dude
I just eat pussy, other people need food
Only got a little time and I ain't tryna spend it
Arguing about who ain't giving who attention
Starting up the engine, need to reboot
I just eat pussy, other people need food
And I use every bone in my body
To keep on holding on to your trust
I know you don't want nothin' to do with me
But just one more time, let's make love
One more time, it ain't much
Fuck 'em all, let's be us, summer's soft sweetness
Call late drunk, you hang up
What a mess I made us, sense, I make none

Can't concentrate, you're always on my brain
If it's love, then why the fuck it come with pain?

Uh uh
Close my eyes before I cross the street
If a car about to hit me, then he ought to beep
Watching Dawson's Creek 'til I fall asleep
It's harder than it seems, I'm under water in my dreams
I'm in awe, this jigsaw, puzzles not complete
I'm just an idea, nothing concrete
Came to raise limits, get higher than plane engines
They tryna change with us, but come to the same difference
Shut your pie-hole, I'm dope and I know
My voice sound like it was a sample off a vinyl
I don't mind those hating on my style
I tend to take the high road, get stoned and fly low
I'm no God, I don't think that I'm a human, though cause I'm so odd
People selling drugs cause they can't find no job
Wonder if Christ made a million off selling the cross
Let bygones be bygones, my mind strong as pythons
The day that I die on will turn me to an icon
Search the world for Zion or a shoulder I can cry on
The best of all time, I'm Dylan, Dylan, Dylan, Dylan, (Dylan)

Somebody do something (Somebody do something)
Somebody do something (Somebody do something)

Sipping Jameson like I was majored in whiskey flavouring
When I'm drunk, I'll cut your head off and leave it dangling
FlyLo's still tryna put me on to Ableton
Asian women love me, I look like David Duchovny
In kindergarten, used to put some condoms in my cubby
In case one of these hoes was tryna fuck me
I ain't nobody, and neither are you
Been contemplating if I even still believe in the truth
I'm so stubborn, I'd rather write my own history book
Where the world don't give a fuck 'bout how you physically look
All your songs are sixteen's and a hook
We're here to reinvent music, it's time for the revolution
I'm dying for the movement, trying not to lose it
Jewish Buddhist consuming the views of Christianity
Wonder if Hindus like to eat fish soup
If it's true, they should hit Alaska in a igloo
I hear the fish biting nice right now
I can't figure out life and feel right right now
Boo, if I think it, I should say it, there's a reason that I write it down
Spit the shit that leave a diaper brown, poo

I think I'm getting sick
Been in this room
Like I was high

Look, I'm posing a question
How many been empty and holding aggression?
Close to depression
Open your eyes and just focus a second
Fuck a recession, my brother
My mind is my weapon, I'm letting it go
Loading and pointing at negative energy
Telling me stop, they're telling me, "No, don't"
Your aura is something you ain't even sure of
Explore the core of California, whores got more to snort up
I've had a smorgasbord of pornographic thought
That's a lot, the feeling come after the shock
Praise me I'd rather you not
Cause it's driving me crazy
The fact that you pay to make me into something I love
You come to the club searching for drugs
Drunk, fucking these sluts
God loves me, what if he does, what does it mean?
You're wasting away doing nothing, you're fronting
Why ain't you chasing your dreams?
We wonder 'bout life but none of us willing to learn
The money we earn is something to burn
Why won't they give me a turn out?
Feed the hungry and clothe the naked
You're mistaken the world is cold and it's lonely ain't it
When 'em high roller homes in Vegas
Raid 'em with some home invasions
Contaminating the place with plague, we just saved the day
I waste away in a room spitting these raps
Yahweh put the world in my hands, I'm giving it back

It's a gift
Our, our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive
It's a gift
Our, our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive

Forfeit in the war, he lays a sword down and walks away
Grabs a 40 from the corner store and begins to contemplate
Dealing with death like he work in the morgue, absorbing the souls
Forgotten, he lost his way
Starring down that barrel, thinking not today
Life's so precious, Lord knows that life is so precious
Fight to the death, 'til there's nobody left
You're holding your breath because you might get infected
I'm animalistic, instinctively thinking I'm getting ballistic
Be specific, to those who in control we all statistics
Misogynistic with a twisted mind, I'm intertwined
My trigger finger itching, all I kill is time
Initial symptoms of schizophrenic behavior
The mind is like religion, can't agree on who's its savior
The newest flavor of superhero, I'm shooting lasers
Except I'm cool with Vader
And blowing up rooms that's full of strangers
A news anchor, the youth can relate to, it's nature
If you're a hater, I'll deal with you later, no thank you
I'm just your neighbor, please don't do me no favors
Really doe, come on homie, we major
I waste away in this room spitting out raps
Yahweh put the world in my hands, I'm giving it back

It's a gift
Our, our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive
It's a gift
Our, our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive


It's just a different time, man, it's just a different time. There was a time, when we showed love. You know like how we, approach a young lady, you see a beautiful young lady you like, you say "Damn, man." You're gorgeous, I'll take off my coat right now and, lay it down on the puddle and, make sure you don't miss a step. You know what I'm talking bout, young man? See all these bitches, hoes, thots? I just don't understand it. I don't know what's to come of you, young man
Yeah you know I'm smokin' at the beginnin'
Of the song like a damn, rapper
Aww man, man, it's crazy bein' so rich, damn

In '09, we were still on the bus, nigga
Before Nak was deluxe, when I didn't have a brush
When it still wasn't hoes tryna fuck with me
'Fore I cleaned up a bit like it's company comin'
I ain't know we were on the cusp of the money
Tryna get a few bucks under custody
And my twin brothers was all Syd's brothers
So my kin gully and my skin toughened
And thick lens coverin' my eyes now
They ain't bright, nigga, I'm just high now
And if this a different way to clear my mind out
I need to find out, I'm doing fine now
And I don't look as stupid when I talk now
And everybody at the show look astounded
And posted up drowsy
In the cut so much that it's pus 'round me
Catch him in the daytime or dusk hours
Smokin' out the pound, houndin' mutts out it
If your tucks lousy then you can't sit with us (nah)
Can't call it harsh livin' when the margin
Between you and all these fuck niggas
Is about as large as it gets
And you workin', givin' arm and a leg
Say he workin' but he just talkin' cause he ain't workin'
Like a long distance bitch
Who you know that's out that's harder than this?
Chargin' niggas like a Tomlison win, nigga
Slight frown on the brow on the brim, color brown
Runnin' wild on the route that was picked
When the clouds branch out
And I'm out with my face in the shallow, drownin' again

I've been drownin' with this shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul
You are drinkin' from a shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul

Drugs got me feelin' like Vigo Carpathian
Just look at the state he's in... yo, yo
The most critically acclaimed, slang contortionist
That ain't suckin' corporate dick
Said it with my balls in grip
Other hand got a cork to hit
All this Ralph be the sportsmanship
Walked in and said I needed all the chips
As well as the one on my shoulder
Feel like my heart got pneumonia, blunt laced, covered in odor
Cops still lockin' niggas up for quotas
Brain still numb from the shit in the soda, so
A generation lost
Facin' a Paul Allen in vacant loft
Warrants bein' filed for the cases fought
And them drugs get obtained by debatin' cost
You ain't Superman while that cape was off
Just Clark, nigga, sittin' in his high rise
Tryna see the bright side of life
And a nigga just keep comin' back with a dark picture
It's like hard liquor, and see people are books
So you judge a mothafucka by the first page
And a bitch by the back cover
The crime is long-sleeved, so the tats covered
Real ones, I'm the last brother, when they see me on stage
They said my shit was so insane
It was like Cobain hit his last number, mothafucka

I've been drownin' with this shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul
You are drinkin' from a shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul

Well, isn't he dizzy off the up's and down's
Got a little Whitney, put it in a blunt for now
She was supposed to get me high
Why the fuck I wanna die now?
And I'm strung out on this dusty couch
In a big white ugly house, I told the bitch slow down
Stop runnin' your mouth
You holdin' my money, just shut up and count
My right nostril hasn't worked in a week
Plus the plug got work, like he servin' for a sheep
Me, I'm swervin' in the Jeep
Burnin' weed, doin' circles in the street
Yellin' "play my shit and wake the baby up!”
I get her faded, put her back in the labia
All my life I've been afraid of powder
All my life I've been afraid of power, where did all that go?
The wrong decision always called my phone
Last supper I was fuckin' with the Corleones
I need somethin' stronger than a cortisone
That can save me from the war unknown
Shoutout to Soulo (SOUL!) and rest in peace Alori Joh
The devil on the other side of the glory hole
Any time, any place, you could bet I'ma eat
Cause my hand on the fork and the fork in the road
Look at all these new faces
I see, I see, I see
They're comin' on the plane but they're leavin' in suitcases
Been a criminal before scales were digital
Used the put the weed in the sole of my blue Asics
Hate myself up to strangers
But the raps are just way too flagrant, so
Here I go, here I go
Throwin' up a prayer, it's a Hail Mary
I've never been religious
But I feel like the scripture's got it all there
It's not just gypsies and fairies
This could be my last breath, I'ma take my time
Cause I'ma go out the same way I came in
Right by the pussy with nothin' on my mind

You are standing in the shallow soul
You are speaking with the shallow soul
Shallow soul
I've been drowning with this shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul
You are drinking from a shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul
(fades)
Uhh, let me get a turkey sandwich, uh lettuce tomato (bitch)

My name Mac Miller, who the fuck are you
Well my crew too live but I ain’t Uncle Luke
And I ain’t no hipster, but girl I can make your hips stir
From Pittsburgh, smoke papers or a swisher
Welcome to the Cam Rellim chronicles
Looking out my monocle
I’m dodging obstacles, I gamble like the Bellagio
You cock-a-roach, I’m heroin cause everything I talk is dope
Type to leave it clean and fucking shiny word to Mop & Glo
Tryin’ to get a mansion ain’t nobody here gon' find my room
Money gonna be green I guarantee you that my slide stay blue
So press play, I start from scratch and never use no template
The next day these losers always goin’ with whats trendy
My pen game is something these motherfuckers have never seen
All City Champion everybody is second string
No need to testify (testify) for the best is I (best is I)
And anybody in my way goin’ to be left to die

I'mma feed the world you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don’t plan on looking back
Anything you need you can find it at the market
If you don’t hold me down, for all I care, you can starve bitch
I'mma feed the world you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don’t plan on looking back
Anything you need you can find it at the market
Anything you need you can find it at the market

I got my own stickers now so literally I’m everywhere
Hundred different shoes still feel the need to cop a fresher pair
These motherfuckers treat me like it’s just my second year
Fool you better get prepared
Don’t know ‘bout you but all my rhymes is deadly here
Frick Park Market where we kicking out the garbage
Sick bars I’ve been a boss so stick around and watch it
Didn't fit around no college campus, chilling writing on top of planet Earth
Fuck who's first, It’s just bout who the hardest
On my own two, fuck who's saying different
Every time I rhyme I get that Punxsutawney feeling
I’m the starter you the fill in
You a martyr I’m just killing
Getting harder with each time I write
Wish I could rewind last night
I had so much fun just kickin’ it and goin’ in
Don’t call me Malcolm if you didn’t fuckin’ know me then
And if you lonely girl I could be your only friend
You got some shit to say I suggest you hold it in

I'mma feed the world you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don’t plan on looking back
Anything you need you can find it at the market
If you don’t hold me down, for all I care, you can starve bitch
I'mma feed the world you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don’t plan on looking back
Anything you need you can find it at the market
Anything you need you can find it at the market
I hope you're proud of me, dude I grew to be
Ingenuity influenced by your eulogy
Going through memories
Like they were movies scenes
I know I've been the shit
All these people full of me
Are you made of
I admit I guess I'm full of myself too
There's just a bunch of shit, I wish I could tell you
This life move's fast, I never knew that
Yours wouldn't have lasted, the dirt hitting your casket, like raindrops
I swear I'll let you know when the pain stops
For now, I need to run to to any
Place the train stops
And everybody wanna talk to me
About some business shit
Never really listening
Couldn't get real interested
My days get darker, so the haze get sparked up
All this hate, sound the same
When my name get brought up
You had a girl, I kinda wish you knocked her up
So I could meet your son and talk you up (Talk you up)

I remember when we were just kids
We knew nothing at all, we'd talk about the life we lived
In West Virginia, lost somewhere out in
West Virginia

It's a dark science, when your friends start dying
Like how could he go? He was part lion
Life goes on, tears all dryed in
Couple years are gone by by then
Can you please help me find my friend
I'll give you anything you need
Multiplied by ten
I heard he moved to a place
Where the time don't end
You don't need money
All you got is time to spend
Life is short, don't ever question the lengths
It's cool to cry
Don't ever question your strength
I recommend no limits, intricate
Thought, go 'head just give it a shot
You'll remember shit you've forgot

Cause way back then I didn't know shit
And I don't know shit now
And when the whole world is looking hopeless
I'mma still hold shit down

I remember when we were just kids
We knew nothing at all, we'd talk about the life we lived
In West Virginia, lost somewhere out in
West Virginia
Uh, ignorant-ass white kid
But I'm still bicycling and recycling
And I'm still eating Gummy Bear vitamins
All my bitches taking Vicodin, huffing nitrogen
Hyper than Williams, middle son, since I was
A little one, moms had to put me on the Ritalin
Made a swisher run, crack the 40 then I lit a blunt
Told Chuck I had a couple raps, so we kicked the drums
All the best rappers are usually dead
But I'm the poison that left a widow Juliet
In the studio with candles lit and Buddha heads
Coming up with all the coldest shit, take your Sudafed
Contagious, speaking while sedated
God shit, make 'em want to add a couple pages to the Bible
I ain't got nothing left in my will
'Cept throw it all in the casket, it's mine still
I need some backpack cast raps
Took a break just to kill the game half-ass
Set some rat traps, went to take a cat nap
Woke up, threw the dead bodies in the trash bags
Act polite, but I'm nasty on the mic
Your bitch don't want my dick, then she has to be a dyke
Slap her but she like it, tell me, "Master, feed me pipe"
I'm the Scotch on the Rocks, you the Appletini type

Bitch, suck my dick before I slap you with it (Gees)
Bitch, suck my dick before I slap you with it (Gees)

I still fucking with these hoes, though
Bozo on these doppelgänger Jojos
Take a bitch to Soho for some Froyo
Tell her she gon' blow it, Romo
And now I'm out in Cali like Tone-Lōc
Young boy, but I'm chilling with some grown folk
No joke, most dope, you just bowl smoke
How much coke you got to sell to make a boat float?
Hit 'em, hit 'em 'til they tell me "No more"
I'm a highly difficult ropes course
Pulling up to Rome on a chrome gold horse
Say "What's up?" to the Pope, pull off in a Porsche
Who you kidding? Your flow's warshed
I ain't from the street but I'll grill you from the porch
I been had hoes, I play sports
Her ass out the bottom of her shorts

Bitch, suck my dick before I slap you with it (Gees)
Bitch, suck my dick before I slap you with it (Gees)

(Black James Bond and a white Shaft)
Turned my daughter to a queen, turned a dollar to a dream
Flashy as high beams, smoking on good weed
Something from kush seeds, the only strand to smoke for us OG's
I'm rich - car service, no car keys
First class flight, 'bout to land to a new bitch
She fuck me and swallowed every homie I came with
MCM bag and nigga, bet some weed in it
200 dollars worth of Backwoods, we all living
Brought the gangsters back to bucket hat, how real is that?
I'm getting money, rub my tummy, that's my baller sack
Quarter million in a safe in case I get a case
Faggot-ass judge hating on me cause my money straight
Dropped 10 racks in all 50 states
Gon' name my next tour Million-Man March
Make a nun throw it back while I pull her scarf
She gave me head, my nuts touched her cross, boss, Figg Side

Bitch, suck my dick before I slap you with it
Let me get a one-way ticket, haven't picked a destination
I'm just tryna catch the train before it has to leave the station
Packing no bags, nothing but the clothes on my back
With a Cognac, let me sip it, tryna to relax
Red wine up in my glass plus Filet Mignon
I got a army right up under me, I'm Genghis Khan
Yeah, it's me against the world, I guess I'll take them on
I might stop and see my girl, but I ain't staying long
What if I'm gone, what the fuck you gon' think then?
I told my story, put my life inside this ink pen
Said I'll make it big when, everybody know me
Well, I made it big and, everybody phony
Ha, so could you pour me, I need a cup
No, none of that liquor, mixing purple stuff
I could talk my pain, but would it hurt too much
Go head, judge me, hate cost money, but this love free

They just dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double-cup of lean, standing on my balcony
Looking at the sky, thinking it could all be mine
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?
They just dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double-cup of lean, standing on my balcony
Looking at the street, thinking it could all be mine
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?
What the fuck is time? I ask 'em, what the fuck is time?
I don't know, what the fuck is time? I ask 'em, what the fuck is time?

What do you do when you think you could be an icon?
Cause all these people get to screaming with the lights on
Like they just seen a ghost, earn my stripes, zebra coat
Racing to the gate but my flight gone
And now these writers taking shots without a Nikon
But I don't fight though, figure it's a typo
Seems we in some shit now, gonna be alright though
Potion in my sprite, then my night slows... down, down
See, that's exactly what I need
My khaki's filled with cheese, my homie Sap is on the beat
Like it was "Donald Trump," a fucking hit but I just call it luck
They throw it on when I'm walking in the club
Hey, this the Burgh shit, I don't deserve this
Well, I don't think you looking far beyond the surface
Learn quick, now I'm big time
Fill your cup up, and I'mma sip mine

They just dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double-cup of lean, standing on my balcony
Looking at the sky, thinking it could all be mine
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?
They just dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double-cup of lean, standing on my balcony
Looking at the street, thinking it could all be mine
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?
What the fuck is time? I ask 'em, what the fuck is time?
I don't know, what the fuck is time? I ask 'em, what the fuck is time?
Someone like, someone like
Someone like, someone like
Someone like, someone like
Someone like
Someone like you, someone like you
Someone like, someone like
Someone like, someone like
Someone like, someone like
Someone like
Someone like you, someone like you
Someone like, someone like

Yeah, light up 'til the pain gone, all I hear is the same song
When the radio came on, fuck around and get based on
Do this shit 'til the day I die, are you ready, are you ready?
Terrified but my hand is steady, verified, get the camera ready
Carry my own weight, all these earthquakes don't wake
Me up from this deep sleep, diving into this cold lake
Fuck a bitch til her toes shake, telling me I'm her soul-mate
Disguised emotion, no face, bullshit with that, no thanks
Dealing with it since '08, fucked around, now I'm done
And I heard you're supposed to race
When you hear the sound of that gun
Now it's losing all of its fun, spending days in solitude
Too many dumb interviews, put me in this awful mood
Not thinking logical, getting high, jump off the moon
Looked into his soul, when he died right there in the hospital
Peace don't seem possible, when the mind is so closed
Came in for your money, then left with all of your hoes

Life move fast but my baby keep it slow
Open up your mind start forgetting what you know
Shit ain't been the same since you left me here alone
You hurt so good, girl your loving hurt so good

Love me, love me, that fentanyl it numb me
Beautiful it get ugly, turn you into a junkie
Still searching for something, but I don't know what
Dreaming about nothing, wake you up and then fuck
I love it when you get a little nasty
Hit it from the back, if you like that, wiggle them ass cheeks
Isn't that sweet, same shit we did last week
'fore all the cash, you might stood up and would've walked passed me
Wake me up from this bad dream, put a match to this gasoline
Every night you somebody different, got me thinking it's Halloween
Fucked up, I can't feel myself, work hard might kill myself
Exist through audio, but all my problems that's real as hell
Trapped in this wishing well, death creeping like Splinter Cell
Getting high, blew my mind away
Find the words to what I'm tryna say
...I'mma think of that later
When the world goes against you, better get that paper

Life move fast but my baby keep it slow
Open up your mind start forgetting what you know
Shit ain't been the same since you left me here alone
You hurt so good, girl your loving hurt so good
You hurt so good
You hurt so good
Good evening everybody
How's everybody doing?
Just wanna ask a question, um, have you,  have you
Have you been in love, before?
You like your vodka with a little touch of lime
You should probably take your heels off
Cause you've been running through my mind
Oh baby, they say we're no good for each other
And I can't really tell, what is this spell you put me under
Your love's not too kind to me
I hate the pain these days of rain
You're playing games of hide and seek, my love
And I'm still trying to find you, I'm looking for you babe
And I'm still trying to find you, through sunshine or rain
I love you

Yeah, you got your stained glass iris
Diamond behind your eyelids, autopilot fly
My heart skipped a beat like a scratched CD
Your skin smell like butterscotch and your lips taste like kiwi
Let's take a plane to Fiji, make a date, let's take it easy
Love is power
Swear there's something about her that make me nervous
Mother Earth done gave us all a gift, she made you perfect
Let's eat some mushrooms and go to the circus
Girl you know I'm loving you just like you deserve it
So baby make me earn it, show me the way you work it
Tell me what you afraid of, I'll spit you my favorite verses
Let's just go take a breath
I want it all, every ounce of love that you got left
You are my drug and love to death
Feel free to fall, you are a catch
I'm in your heart, I'm in your dream
So fuck the world, it's you and me
She is the only one that got away
If love don't last forever then forever ain't the same, yeah

Your love is not too kind, to me, yeah
You know my love is sugar sweet, yeah
The only thing on my mind, is she
You think about you, I've been thinking of me
My love, my love
My love, my love, yeah
And I know that nothing lasts forever
Nothing lasts forever

Yeah, and she is cool, calm and collected
I knew that you was the one
When I seen you leave me breathless
Say okay I need a second day today, give me attention
I want to take care of you
Marry you, something I'm prepared to do, there can't be two
You was here, I ran from you, scared to take that step
But now that I am ready, you're not, you up and left me
Hope your new man make you laugh like I do
I do not mean to worry you with my obsession
I just want to be beside you
I'm too nice, and I had to pay that price
Everything I do is wrong, everything you do is right
Let's start a family, hold on to forever baby
Your pussy is a palace and your head is crazy (moan)
That bomb is detonating, look at this mess you're making
I am the king, you are the queen
Look at this chess we're playing
Oh we had a love that love was record breaking
I'm sick of waiting, yeah

Your love is not too kind, to me, yeah
You know my love is sugar sweet, yeah
The only thing on my mind, is she
You think about you, I've been thinking of me
My love, my love
My love, my love, yeah
And I know that nothing lasts forever
Nothing lasts forever

So gimme all of your love
And I will be yours, through rain and through shine
Gimme all of your love
You will be mine through rain and through shine
(Gimme your loving, babe) Yeah yeah, yeah
(Gimme your loving, babe) Yeah yeah, yeah
(Gimme your loving, babe) Yeah yeah, yeah

(Gimme your loving, babe) Yeah yeah, yeah
I never take a day off
Work around the clock, my engineer gettin' paid off
Rock like Aesop, light the weed and take off
So high I cannot see, Adolf
Now I got these rappers all breakin' up a sweat
Cause every time I get up on the mic, it come correct
And I learned it from the best, always dressed in somethin' fresh
Lookin' for a little dime, big butt and nice chest
Yes, they heard I used to rock Guess
But now I'm rockin' clothes that ain't in the stores yet
Travel back in time, I'm in a vortex
Tryna to make it work out, think I need more reps
Used to take a bus, now the boy board jets
Cause K.I.D.S. got me buzzin' like a fuckin' hornet
They say I got next, tell them that I got now
It's all Disney boy, my family Proud
Make 'em say "ow", make 'em say "oh"
The hoes that tell me "yes", the same ones that tell you "no"
Woah, I ain't just an Average Joe, way above the average flow
Boy, my life is Most Dope

No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
Pursuit to be happy, only laughing like a child
I never thought life would be this sweet
It got me cheesin' from cheek to cheek
And I ain't going to wait for nothing
Cause that just ain't my style
Life couldn't get better
This 'gon be the best day ever

If it ain't about a dream, then it ain't about me
Go a couple full weeks without a good night's sleep
Imagination, makin', musical creation
The journey that I'm facin' plus the paper that I'm chasin'
Got me crazy, half insane and with the lames I see you hatin'
But there's nothing' that you're changin', thumbs up, I'm maintainin'
No complainin' when it's rainin'
I'll be in another zone, move out my mother's home to a world I call my own
I ain't gonna play around no more
Found a difference from the ground and the floor
If we got a fight, I'll be down for the war
Thumbs up, homie I'll be sure

No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
Pursuit to be happy,only laughing like a child
I never thought life would be this sweet
It got me cheesin' from cheek to cheek
And I ain't going to wait for nothing
Cause that just ain't my style
Life couldn't get better
This 'gon be the best day ever
Open your legs
Say yeah, share, say yeah, share, say yeah

Hearts on my timeline, bullet to your rose
Then I watch your petal fold
Don't you know your body been mine?
I know you know I know
Sexy, nasty, have no guideline
One day, four times
You don't mind that I don't care (pleasure, pleasure...)
Your divinity has turned me into a sinner
God is fair (pleasure, pleasure...)
And your beauty can even make hell have a winter

Yeah and a freak mind is divine so we fuck from behind
On these sides, between thighs, I eat up
Why do, why do anything but trust myself?
Tried to give her up but she fuck so well
Man that bitch so cold, man that bitch so cold
I'ma take my time, I'ma hit that slow
'Cause I ain't in a rush young girl
You're the only thing for me in this fucked up world
And do you believe in love?
Hold on tight when demons come
It'll be alright, no need to run
Stay with me tonight, we'll see the sun
And when we wake up early we'll still be young
Never felt this free before
I need you more than keys and doors
I need you sleepin' next to me
The blanket sheets, I'll take them all and keep you warm
Yeah and I teach her that we were the creatures of love
You be the leader, I could be Julius Caesar
When I'm pullin' up in the Beamer
The beats in the trunk, all the freaks wanna fuck

Hearts on my timeline, bullet to your rose
Then I watch your petal fold
Don't you know your body been mine?
I know you know I know
Sexy, nasty (sexy, nasty)
Have no guideline (have no guideline)

You shy, you don't reveal too much
No lies, don't hide yourself at all
With you, I just can't help but fall
It's true, and I'll try everything
Girl you're, my sexy nasty, thing
She been getting faded all the time, flap your wings
I been getting stoned all week
It make me go too deep
Girl you so lonely, will you come home with me?
Just take your clothes off babe
Know that we been talkin' on the phone all day
I love it when you tell me that you don't behave
Tell me when and where, I bet I won't be late
All I really wanna do is procreate
I'm a Superman, you'll be my Lois Lane
Know you late for work, you stayin' home today
We gon' keep on goin' 'til our bones both break
It's the grown folk way, yeah

Hearts on my timeline, bullet to your rose

Don't you know your body been mine?
I know you know I know
Sexy, nasty (sexy, nasty)
Have no guideline (have no guideline)
One day, four times
You don't mind that I don't care
God is fair


Hello, I would like to tell you about my love affair with my husband and the wonderful ways that we were able to understand each other and find out about each other. We got to know each other little by little living very close in the same building and he would help me with things and I would see him and think "what a cute guy" and he was a cute guy. And it was just little by little we got to know, just to say hello. One day I invited him to a party and I had heard so much about him, people respected him, and he was good to everybody, he knew, people he worked with all adored him. And it was something so important, the respect that you have for somebody, for me was the most important. Being attracted to him and being...finding people respected him and I respected him. I love the fact that he sensed how my feelings were, and I learned to understand and respect and see his feelings and understand his feelings ahead of time...
So, it was so very easy to be together and look forward to being together and our love affair just blossomed the more we saw each other and the more we were together, we learned more and more about each other. After a short period of time we became engaged and had a very small intimate wedding with just family and very close friends, the friends we continued to have for the rest of our life and then came two adorable little boys. And...my husband just adored my daughter and adored the two boys, and I feel I just gave him a wonderful life. A good marriage and a wonderful family and I know he really had a beautiful life and I did too. And how important it is to love, respect and care for each other.
Yo, yo, yo

Look, concoction of hamentashens, launching a bottle rocket (ok)
Done being nice, I'm here for your life and all the profits (woah)
I'm not your conscience, you nuts? Almonds and Häagen-Dazs
Auction off your grandfather's watch from the Holocaust
I'm iconic, naked walking in the garden and bird watching
Alarming all of these cardinals like I need a pope (pope)
Puffing that white smoke (smoke), get faded and play the maestro
I'm ice cold, bunny slippers, nice robe (probably velvet)
Sneaky bitch stole my Rollie last night, yo
I might know some dyke hoes who can fight though (yeah)
Walking on a tight rope, underneath a microscope
But close up, we all just molecules and isotopes (that's very deep)
What psychic don't know the future?
To live life, you kids might just close your computer (go get some excercise)
The street lights might blind you though (blind you though)
Make a collage and look at it through a kaleidoscope

There's a bird, in the sky
Look at him fly, why?
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why
Let the money pile, I'll be running wild
Life's a mothafuckin' joke so we fuck around
Feel like I do this in my sleep
Literally, I do this in my sleep


It's an impression of Bueller
Yeah, yeah,a little TV money (okay), dollars for sense of humor(yeah)
Scholar but my attendance like Bueller, so no use for a tutor
Some cold brews in the cooler (have one)
Coming through in the wood grain PT Cruiser, stunting
I'm pissed off like a blind person looking for a restroom (restroom)
Probably be dead soon inhaling cigarette fumes (coughs)
Sorry for that blind people comment, that was just rude (yeah)
And I was raised better, say God bless you (God bless you)
I'm Kenny Powers, you're more of a Debbie Downer
My bitch taking off her trousers every time I get around her
I'm nasty, I never shower, go sleep on a bed of flowers
Not into this conversation, I've been in my head for hours
I'm out

There's a bird, in the sky
Look at him fly, why?
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why
Let the money pile, I'll be running wild
Life's a mothafuckin' joke so we fuck around
Feel like I do this in my sleep
Literally, I do this in my sleep
Uhh, passport, filling it up with stamps
Set a camp up on my land, swam the rivers of Japan
She keep on asking for a rack so I ran
Looking back like you can't see who I am
Think my bitch don't know me no more
Cause everytime she's sad, I can't console her no more
If money buy you love, then love's not enough
So tell my why you on your knees crying to the floor
If you had the chance
Would you take the time you need to make it right?
The clouds are gray
But would you pay the price to paint 'em white?
Might have a baby on the way
Cause I been going in raw, it feel better, that real pleasure
I'm not real, I think I never was
I get a rush every time she let me get a touch
I need to feel that (love) I need to feel that (pain)
My garden hasn't been growing so can you bring that (rain)
I keep my head up (high) a little fed up (lies)
They always tell me where my mind is on this LP
I don't exist, hieroglyphics
Pyrotechnics, metaphysics
Telekinetics put 50K on my credit card
Look for the answers, I'm searching but I ain't getting far
Let's get it on, I'm royal like Tenenbaums in Lebanon
Decepticons, hit it 'til my head is gone

Point me to the road, and I'mma run it
Bloodhound with my nose to the money
Ain't fucking with these hoes (never that) getting duckets
'Til I die, while my foes busy running, fuck it
Marijuana smoke in my stomach, toasted in public
Head in the clouds and my toes in the struggle
Like who didn't test yet? Test this
There's a few new rules in effect, bitch
Listen up, go

See this a rather spooky action movie, roll it up and pass it to me
Hash and booty, absolutely, smack a groupie acting bourgie
See a creature, ass beauty, need a feature, rather shoot me
Truly bitches must have them bad jeans and back is Coogi
Had to do these rapper tunes to let 'em know the trap is booming
Past the views of Catholic schoolers, fact, but you in fact assuming
Back to doing cash pursuing, posted up like Patrick Ewing
Rapper feuds are sad if you would battle for a stack or two
These eloquent irrelevant sentences show my penmanship
Indefinite boundaries show you the end of it
Don't forget you infested in nasty crevices
Allowing birds to fall to their death before they even fly
He and I are not the same
Doctor, doctor, please prescribe me something for the pain
Money in machines, those will make you change
If I go tomorrow, I just hope it ain't in vain, but I can't complain

Point me to the road, and I'mma run it
Bloodhound with my nose to the money
Ain't fucking with these hoes (never that) getting duckets
'Til I die, while my foes busy running, fuck it
Marijuana smoke in my stomach, toasted in public
Head in the clouds and my toes in the struggle
Like who didn't test yet? Test this
There's a few new rules in effect, bitch
Listen up, go

Revis take me shoppin' when I'm up in New York
Hit the shoe store go and cop a few more
You at the mall getting dinner at the food court
I'm at LA eatin' 22 course
Young boss bitch, paper in my pockets
I got a closet filled with shoe boxes
Mom says my spending habit a little bit obnoxious
But a pilot stay fresh up in his cockpit
Used to rock hand-me-downs
Now I buy some clothes wear-em-out
Hit the club bitches pull they cameras out
Livin' in a dream they beginnin' to believe
My hotel smell like cigarettes and weed
Shit, with what I'm spittin' they should give me a degree
Good liquor what I'm sippin' isn't cheap
Uh, finna blow, don't snooze, don't sleep
All I really need is some shoes on my feet

I make 'em so mad, they got no swag
Pippens on my feet they the throw backs
Look, my money good but these hoes bad
So they stay attached to my gonads
Wakin' up to a few L's
Open up my closet to that new shoe smell
I guess I'm goin' well
Smoking all the weed that I used to sell
But once my album goes in the shelves
It's going Nextel how it's finna sell
For now we sellin' tapes out my shoe box
Any spot just set up my shop
Ya mad that ya girl always says that I'm hot
Shes buyin' my t-shirt but shes spendin' your guap
Say wuddup if you see me around
Nike Airs separate my feet from the ground

And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete

Better act right cause I smack dykes, give 'em blow and a bit of that bagpipe
Bitch wanna live that rap life, but I already hit that last night
Think you're fucking with me, huh? Must be hitting that crack-pipe
I be making my money, thank God I learned how to add right
My cash like that cocaine, give me more, say give me more
Don't worry 'bout it, ain't no thing, big titty hoes in my videos
Classy bitch, don't kiss and tell, smack her ass and then wish her well
Life sucks, better give 'em hell, get money, fuck girls, free Biggavel
A million in my briefcase, 'bout to shop for some real estate
'bout to party with drugs though, turn it up, bitch feel the bass
Throwing money, in your face, feeling good, living great
Bad bitches in different states, it's like I think I'm Vincent Chase
With pornstars, sports cars, and my crib got a courtyard?
How we get all this money though? You know how big his tours are?
Greedy bitch, you a needy bitch, want some money, but need some dick

And my belt monogram, when I die bet she fuck my hologram though
When I die bet she fuck my hologram though
When I die bet she fuck my hologram
When I die bet she fuck my hologram

We in my black Benz, windows up, getting head, smoking blunts
Everybody know what's up and I turn them girls to sluts
Crib's like a mob boss, my bitch get my car washed
We non-stop, my dick out, her jaw drop
Cause all we do is fuck, fuck-fuck
All she wanna do is fuck, fuck-fuck
All she, all she wanna do is fuck, fuck-fuck
All she wanna do is fuck, fuck-fuck, fuck

Don't I look like a drug dealer? Don't I look like I'm somebody
Killing beats with that Murder Inc, don't I look like I'm Irv Gotti
Riding through with my hippy van, you broke bitches don't give a damn
You softer than the Michelin man, your bitch put her pussy on Instagram
Better go hard when my flow start, they brand new with they old cars
Your pockets is on low carbs, she do a show, she a pollstar
In the penthouse, with the pants down with the camera out, no hands now
Them hard drugs, we don't ran out
Can't believe that's someone's grand child
She's so bad but I like it, wanna hear your pussy I'll mic it
My credit card bill is righteous but girl that ass is so priceless
Spend the night with the right bitch, my dick ill, my pipe sick
Small pussy, tight fit, she loves to sniff that white shit
Fuck free, no charge, I play with that pussy like Mozart
Eat that pussy, I won't starve, love the pussy with my whole heart
Bitch named Layla my Clapton ho
Give me head put the Benz in captain mode

And my belt monogram, when I die bet she fuck my hologram though
When I die bet she fuck my hologram though
When I die bet she fuck my hologram

I know you stressin',  you don't gotta keep me guessin'
I'm full of questions, in return I get the silent treatment
I don't know why I'm speakin'
You say, you say, you say
It's way too late, goodbye, you leavin'
Why you got me stressin'?
I could have a whole collection
Just be faded in my own dimension
You so complicated, I swear that pussy Grammy nominated
Let's make some music, fuck all of the bullshit

Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?
Just a little while, just a little while, just a little while
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?
So just a little while, just a little while, just a, just a little while

Okay now, baby, don't you leave my side, don't even try
I'mma go crazy, girl, you saved me
Meditate me, get me piece of mind
It's only she and I, ocean floor, how deep we dive
We be high lookin' for another fuckin' tree to climb
She was playin' hard to get, I read between her lines
Binge watched "Sopranos", made it all the way to season five
I am her, she is I
She had to come, see her freaky side, leavin' me behind

Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?
Just a little while, just a little while, just a little while
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?
So just a little while, just a little while, just a, just a little while

Girl, shake that body
Get 'em Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Get 'em! (Get 'em!)
Girl, shake that body

Whoa, what do we have here?
People want to know how we could be that weird
How many hoes want to clean Mac's beard?
I kill flows, think I need that tear on a tattoo
My bitch suck, she a vacuum
Fuck her in the ass everytime I'm in a bad mood
Ain't got a choice, know she do it cause she have to
I hit it raw while I'm listening to Papoose
No respect, cause you wear a V-neck
I mean stress, pressure that could even make Keith sweat
I wish Narnia was on a GPS
I wish Rihanna was DTF
I got rich with these rap songs
Bought a drug problem, now the cash gone
Album filled with all sad songs
But this the one that I can laugh on

Get 'em Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Get 'em! (Get 'em!)
Girl, shake that body
Get 'em Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Get 'em! (Get 'em!)
Girl, shake that body

Girl, shake that body, them ass and totties
I want to see them cankles at my hotel lobby
Bitch, why you so damn snobby?
Your ass flatter than the back of my head
I bought you dinner now it's time to pay me back with some head
Or I'ma have my little sister beat the back of your head
I'm a grade-A douchebag, I'm a dickhead
Asshole area where my gooch sag
Little momma got salty at me, she started talking tough
So I called the Wolf Gang up, they start to bark it up
Popped a hundred mollies, fifth of sherm, think I was sparking up
A bottle of Zima, the Beamer, I started parking up
Seen my nigga, Mac, and he hopped in the back
And then we jet to Fatburger, ordered some Big Macs
And bitch came with a gauge, and she wanted my fade
But I'm a bitch-ass nigga so I say

Get 'em Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Get 'em! (Get 'em!)
Girl, shake that body
Get 'em Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Get 'em! (Get 'em!)
Girl, shake that body

T-Dollaz and Mac Meezy
Making sure you niggas don't win like referees
Looking for the bitches that love to suck peewee, Herman, I'm a vermin
And you could tell I golf with my hat, man, fuck Thurnis

I'm at IHOP's and eating with Tyler
Drink cocoa then double-team Mariah
But please, don't tell Nick
We were all watching movies at a Motel 6
Like ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
I hope Kendrick fuck Gaga
If Madonna on the Kabbalah
Then me and Snoop could chill and be Rastas
I don't need Prada to show you I'm rich
Pulling out the llama like "Show me your tits"
Keep crying cause I still ain't over my bitch

Oh well, it'll be OK...
(Yeah)
Can you feel it?
Don't answer that, that was a rhetorical question
(Ahem) rhetorical (rhetorical)
(unhhh)

Forever life been never nice, we expedite the process
And every night I get advice, cause life is way too complex
Heaven's lights are hella bright, ironic how that came to be
But can't you see? This angel speaks
She's saying the place is safe for me
I told "wait for me," the make believer normally disguise
Transform before your eyes and glorifies euphoric highs
The morning rises and I'm fast asleep
Somewhere off in the master suite
Having dreams of Latin queens and nasty freaks
My mind, it wanders to places yonder and even farther
When I'm sleep walking I'm Stephen Jobs or I'm Peter Parker
A genius author, a Jesus preaching just to feed his daughter
The weed to spark up, yeah he's a goner, fuck these primadonnas
I'll always wonder what happened 3000 years ago
I like to toy with the idea that we really know
Is what I do important in the grand scheme of things?
In my head these dreams are dreamt, trust me we are kings

I'm wearing a blindfold, like where did the time go
I know you hear me out there, give me a sign though?
I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes
Baby I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes
Take me away girl, somewhere they won’t be
Hold you closely, look at me, don't speak
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
So will you follow me wherever my mind goes?

I'm just trying to make it all make sense
As you hypothesize on how to monetize and take advantage of
All the time “we fall behind, get lost in this Aquarium
America, the standard of vanity when the camera's up
We become celebrities, distract from the hysteria
Confessions that I have and curiosity about life and death
Most of us will never understand it, we just like the quest
Read about the meaning of dreaming and all its messages
Sedatives that take me to God, witness his fetishes
We all in search for substance, that drugs you pain and numbness
Circumstances advance the second chances for this beloved
I wish I could tell you that I didn't see this coming
But I'm ready for it all to end, die before tomorrows trend
Your life, it all depends on dollars spent and knowledge gained
Darkness on the brain, lost inside, forgotten days
Life, it works in such mysterious ways
All these years that I pray, hope you hear what I say

I'm wearing a blindfold, like where did the time go
I know you hear me out there, give me a sign though?
I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes
Baby I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes
Take me away girl, somewhere they won’t be
Hold you closely, look at me, don't speak
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
So will you follow me wherever my mind goes?

Wherever my mind goes
I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes
Wherever your mind goes
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes
I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes
I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
I'm, in a room filled with holographic images
Path is limitless, death, well that's ridiculous
I'm a live forever, cause a legend never die
See the world as simple, but complex in the design
I spent some time just thinkin'
Where did that get me? High, more drinkin'
Now my head empty, so can it last a couple minutes more?
Pain a funny thing when you can't figure out the source
Bear witness while I'm checkin' bitches off my hit list
Try to understand the fuckin' message I encrypted
Ancient, halucinatin' visions of utopia
Until I figure out that the perfect world a lonely one
Never hold my tongue, vocal is a loaded gun
And I'ma shoot somebody in the face if they too slow to run
Mac Miller, I'm the only one
But I'm the coldest one, this is pandemonium

Got my middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split
Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public
Welcome to America
Motherfucker, welcome to America
My middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split
Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public
Welcome to America
Motherfucker, welcome to America

Still, in a room filled with holographic images
Crushin' information into powder, then I'm sniffin' it
Directly to my head, never sleep or use my bed
Iller than the future death of you ingestin' Sudafed
Might head to Budapest just to get a Gucci vest
Hop into a jet, get some rest to diffuse the stress
See, this is what I do the best
Nothin' that you got except the bullet gettin' through my chest
Save hard, a Braveheart, a warrior
I take part to stay far from coroners
I heard some corny words said about my music though
Talkin' all that shit, sound exactly like a groupie ho
Most Dope, got you hooked, yellin' Ruffio
First you lose your mind, then you lose your soul
So what you talkin' about? thinkin' you're out of options
American born, impeccable form above and beyond, never the norm

Got my middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split
Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public
Welcome to America
Motherfucker, welcome to America
My middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split
Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public
Welcome to America
Motherfucker, welcome to America

Yo chick live in Pittsburgh? Bet I steal her
Shout out my wigga Mac Miller, comin' up in a world full of killers
I'll be shaded up at the villa
With a girl that know what the deal is
They don't know I come from the illest
City on the map, we don't know how to act, ahh!
Realest young rappin go getters in America
Bad chick get tossed around like the merry go
CV and Mac meezy takin' off on PJ's
We the future so every night is a new day
Sittin' in the studio, chain on and my hat low
Young visionaries and we sellin' out the rap show
I can trigger the wave in my sleep
Name paved, I feel like I am engraved on the beat
Wake up shower, get paid and repeat
Spit one flow and got made on the streets
Welcome to the land where you never stay for free
Swag worth a mill, drop cast let it deal
Veggies

Got my middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split
Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public
Welcome to America
Motherfucker, welcome to America
My middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split
Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public
Welcome to America
Motherfucker, welcome to America

Bout to drop hot shit, runnin' out of patience, niggas not sick
Rollin' up the dankest loud, plane goin' mach 6
Rise to the top, the topics change
The Glocks in the Stock Exchange
Now watch the price of life on the block drop, insane
You can't stop this reign, don't name drop in vain
Inhale toxic flames from tropic strains, it's awkward strange
Last week he was nothin', boxers stain
Now everybody love him and chicks offer top for fame
To the top I aim, testin' waters so I've been afloat
No deal but flow so real, he been in the scopes
Sun got shine, now they say he shady but he never dippin' though
Still facing L's, you would think a nigga's wins was low
What you think I'm in this for?
Won't stop 'til the nigga who invented dope
End the flow or behind bars droppin' prison soap
Begging for forgiveness, but it's business though
I'm record spittin' Guinness flows
Got it up in sources now he in the store
This is madness (madness)
This is an outrage! (an outrage)
As a matter of fact, this is outrageous! (outrageous)
Hahahah, yeah

Young sire, slap the fuck out Jon Cryer
Rough rider, raw bust inside a vagina
Like I want kids, my head continues to be haunted
I burn a city down while I'm unconscious
Maybe gon' and take some quaaludes, conversate with Jesús
Batting practice with the mothafuckin' ghost of Babe Ruth
Do as a saint do, turn painful to graceful
Devil on my trails, I'm trying to find the Holy Grail
(Coughs repeatedly) Right there
And if Mars is the farthest that man has set his target
Then I don't know why I even started
I'm sick of being too nice to people who don't do shit but consume light
Told myself, "Fuck the world kid, just do what you like
Go and have a food fight, start yourself a new life
You're too bright to be inside a bunch of mediocrity
But all those big words ain't gon' get you paid
And those abstract ideas for sure won't get you laid
You got it made in that mad house
What the fuck you got to be sad 'bout? Go 'head and rap now
Do what you do best
I mean, that's what you do best
Matter fact mothafucka, you suit vest, you need to buy a new dress
I heard you and your girl live in a duplex
I'ma put her ass in a suplex, the sun east, the moon west
You got a clue, what does a clue get? Nothing"

My milk and honey, my chérie-chérie amore
My Cinderella in her carriage by the doorway
Her ruby slipper made the wizard send the scarecrow
And the lion through the forest
To the Wicked Witch's fortress where she scorched them in the foreplay
Remember that? He said he'd fight the box to see the wizard
When he was visited by Dorothy who came here on a blizzard
Now the whole world's in color, still
How Auntie Em was next of kin but not her mother, real
Her face was careworn, I suspected she migrated to Kansas up from Dearborn
And had beef with Mrs. Gulch from the very beginning of year one
Mr. Candyman, the parables parabolic
The poetry's like the poems and psalms of Ecclesiastes
Lightning should strike the stone and then Moses should make a tablet
The Judge will bang the wood up in parliament with the mallet
And yell "Hear hear", finally some order to this rap shit
Finally some sort of water to soil these cracked lips
I keep my shit crispy and elegant
So miss me with the irrelevant, the god body is heaven-sent
The hard-body is reverence, since the son of Byford
Brother of Fal, every rhyme's halal
Every line is kosher, livin' la vida loca
Shout out to Tony Toca, we ballin' like we suppose to...
Think for yourself and you'll find out
That a lot of those so-called authorities are bullshit
Yeah, aye, Jerm, Jerm
Ahh! Ahh!

I'm the mothafuckin' greatest, y'all don't know that yet
I don't need your money, you can hold that check
At the crib in some Polo sweats
I don't need a hoe, that's what the hoes don't get
I'm on my worst behavior
Bad side piece with the perfect flavor
Mothafuckas never loved us
Comin' for your money, mothafucka don't trust us
Huh, you ain't shit
Bought a brand new crib, yeah, I move that brick
I don't want nothin' with your doo-doo clique
Treat her like a dog, how I do that bitch
Done doin' promo
And it's still mothafuckin' Most Dope
Made a couple million off a brand
Mothafucka, we ain't even got a logo
Bitch, you better have my money (I stay feelin' myself)
I don't see anybody but me (man I'm killin' myself)
And this shit too real
See a mothafucka like me gettin' money
(How does it feel?)
Already been, but I'm back for more
Insomniac, I don't know what I got a mattress for
Insomniac, I don't know what I got a mattress for
Don't sleep!

I'm an insomniac, a mothafuckin' insomniac
(Don't try to sneak around me)
I'm an insomniac, a mothafuckin' insomniac
(So don't try, don't try to sneak around me)
I'm an insomniac, a mothafuckin' insomniac
(Oh, hello Q)

Yeah, yeah, said, said I'm a maniac, crazy, act insane
Think I might need a cage in fact
Chain reactions happen when I make a pact
A psycho, God made me that
Cause I fade to black and get down like a plane attack
You mothafuckas just made me laugh
Ha ha, God damnit, safety drill, do not panic
Let me see how loud you scream (AHHH!)
I'm off the map, mothafuckas start lookin'
But they're never gonna see where I be
She only speak French
Said "Bitch look, don't try and speak around me"
I don't sleep at all
If you on that bullshit, I don't wanna be involved, shit
I could make a million puttin' my lyrics on a tee
Fearless, Jet Li, fourth quarter, Gretzky
Take your bitch, Joe Pesci, don't test me
Don't flex if you don't got shit on me
And you ain't got shit on me, come get it
(Come get it, come, come get it, come, come)
Drawer full of fresh whites, snow bag full of unleaded
I don't get enough credit
Don't sleep!

(M-M-M-M-M-M)
They done fucked up, han?
The biggest bezzle, han?
The don, Ricky Farrakhan
(M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music)

My weed burnin', my chain glitter
He's self made, Mac Miller my real nigga
Fuck who don't like, bitch come see me
Fuck who don't like, hitta, hitta, hitta
Gettin' money so complicated
I'm the shit, I'm constipated
Yo baby momma, straight G
Let me use the crib to mail all the weed
California, Atlanta
White girl in the black Phantom
My top down, mid-December
Ride with a big black fat nigga
Krispy Kreme, then it's chicken wings
Introduce you, different things
Jet skis and the best weed
Think it's fake? Bitch test me
I'm jetlagged, don't need a stylist
Pants sag, Jimmy Fallon
Blowin' green in the green room
Def Jam like Boss really wildin'
Yeah they hate but won't box a nigga
Bought the estate from a boxer nigga
Paranoid, I'm walkin' 'round
I'm butt naked with my chopper, nigga
Hahahahaha
I'm butt naked with my chopper, nigga

I'm an insomniac, a mothafuckin' insomniac
(Don't try to sneak around me)
I'm an insomniac, a mothafuckin' insomniac
(So don't try, don't try to sneak around me)
I'm an insomniac, a mothafuckin' insomniac
I'm an insomniac, a mothafuckin' insomniac
Damn you rabbit, you smell like fucking piss!
Yeah, no fucks when I go nuts
You can kiss my ass
Give no fucks when I go nuts
Cause I smoke dust, overdosed on the sofa, yeah
Fucking rabbit!

I give no fucks when I go nuts
Cause I smoke dust, overdosed on the sofa, dead
Woke up from a coma
Poured up with a soda, smoked, went back to bed
Never thought I'd be such a loner
I tell my bitch that I fucking own her
My neighbor's daughter just got a dog
I'mma run it over, I'm a fucking soldier
So cold bro, fuck pneumonia
All my bitches got love for Sosa
I just wanna fuck Rosa Acosta
Then disappear in Southern California
Strung out to the night, I'm chilling
Everybody worried that the lights might kill them
Uh, via sight slipping
Long lines of those white women
I'm with the homies, bump Counting Crows
Just went through a half ounce of coke
Blood pouring all out my nose
Don't tell my mom I got a drug problem
I'm fucking high-ly publicized
When the sun go down, I come alive
Cause the guns go off in the summer time
The guns go off in the summer time, blaow

This another motherfucking rap song
Broke and crazy, rich and famous doesn't last long
Spent all my cash on a broken dream
Went from weed and liquor to the coke and lean
All-all-all I got's this mansion and this potpourri
But don't I look so handsome in these Polo jeans?
Don't-don't-don't I look so handsome in these Polo jeans?
Whoa

The rabbit can kiss my ass
Come on, let's go man
I hate you
Fucking rabbit! Kill his ass!
I don't like rabbits coming to my fucking house, I kill 'em

I blow a spliff before the ink dries on the paper
And lately, I don't like shit, I been inside on the daily
Getting wasted as the time that I'm spending high and sedated
I'm putting five in his face, because we don't buy into bullshit
As soon as it's flashing lights then it's kush to hide in the bushes
I do this shit out of spite cause there's niggas that overlooked me
Forever, I'm more content with dark and stormier weather
Flip the fucking cross on your rosary, we supposed to be better
But here's a toast to your efforts
And don't approach me with nothing that isn't money or breakfast
I'm close to choking a pussy, pussy
Sweaty Man, you best had bet your bottom dollar on him
With a couple niggas, weighing sess like it's a lot of options
15 on me for soda and swishers
And who's the shit, a bag of chips and a colon decleanser?
I'm over bitches trying to act like I owe 'em a picture
Rather introduce these hoes to Vince who could show you a pistol
Listen, ST was the older initials
Been rap game tighter than boa constrictors
Rolling stone like a boulder raving
I'm so impatient and going dumb as
Disclosing my fucking home location to total strangers
No love in my heart for coppers, blood from my lungs on the sink
Cashing out off the garments, the artist, fuck what you think
The sky'll turn black and the carrions could pick
At my flesh when I rest, tell 'em bury me a-drift

This another motherfucking rap song
Broke and crazy, rich and famous doesn't last long
Spent all my cash on a broken dream
Went from weed and liquor to the coke and lean
All-all-all I got's this mansion and this potpourri
But don't I look so handsome in these Polo jeans?
Don't-don't-don't I look so handsome in these Polo jeans?
Whoa

It's the official drug user, Soulo
It's Ab-Soul, jack... listen, yo!
Looks like I wrote this song on paper
First time I did that in like 3 years..
My handwriting is horrible and I can barely read this

Hey, hey, don't even know what's in my head anymore tho
Uh, figured out I ain't gonna go to college, Lee Corso
Fuckin' girls, but I never kept the door closed
Want you all to hear the way I put it in her torso
I ain't normal, I'm clinically insane
I guess it's the result of drugs that enterin' my brain
All of a sudden, every legend keep on mentionin' my name
All that does is show me that my life will never be the same
Police tryna to figure out how to get me locked up
I tell those cops suck dog nuts
Arrivin' to the party in a chariot
Lookin' for a scary bitch that I can pop her cherry pit
I'm very sick, yes, very ill
Eternal Sunshine, Jim Carey feel
At the amusement park scared of heights, ferris wheel
Double dare me to kill?

Got some soul like De La do
They say I'm new, it's nothing but some deja-vu
Everywhere you go these people hate on you
It's deja-vu, deja-vu
One time for the grind
A little soul like De La do
They say I'm new, it's nothing but some deja-vu
Everywhere you go these people hate on you
Deja-vu, deja-vu

Wind chimes, sick rhymes
Been high on this incline
Tryna get my money stackin' tall, 6'9"
Have some caviar, sip wine
Sacrificin' sanity, sacrificin' normal
Purpose is for people in the plural
Form never formal, an art form, not a mural
Work 4 bars that are tighter than your corn rows
See a girl that's lookin' horny in the 4th row
Ha, I just put it in her mouth, ortho-
Dontist, manipulatin' phonics, put em into sonnets
Let me put you on this nastier than Nas is
Bubonic plague, bacteria that's tryna to find a way
Spread, Like yolk from a broken egg
Talkin' shit? You just diggin' your grave

Got some soul like De La do
They say I'm new, it's nothing but some deja-vu
Everywhere you go these people hate on you
It's deja-vu, deja-vu
A little soul like De La do
They say I'm new, it's nothing but some deja-vu
Everywhere you go these people hate on you
Deja-vu, deja-vu

Hypothetically of dope, I kick incredibly
Potentially could be the remedy for happiness without the ecstasy
No methamphetamines, hot, 110 degrees
Visually stunnin', gotta see it on the LED
When I was 17 I thought I had it figured out
Now I see what it's about, went in down a different route
It's crucial, 3 new schools, life with a spoonful
Of sugar, yea I need my medicine
Fuckin Mary Poppins, gotta treat her like the president
Represent all these fuckin' people that I never met
Some expect me to be the greatest ever
Hear me on the radio, shit'll change forever
Now I'm just a pop sensation, fuck your expectations
I'mma be the best, have some patience
Thought that it was great, then poof!
It was nothing but some deja vu, yeah
Clarity...
Clarity...

Clarity—figure all this out, I ain't gona take a charity
Marry me, wish everyone could shake
And play the tambourine perfect
I know I love you I ain't tryna let those words slip
Pure bliss, I knew that we would stay together, we in cursive
Infatuation, when every single move you make is fascinatin'
Gravitatin' towards anything that gives a sense of happiness
Activist, love activeless
Sendin' my love for girls who got some cuts at their wrists
Hope you found what you lookin' for
I hope you found what you lookin' for

You take away the pain and I thank you for that
If I ever get the chance, bet I'm paying you back
I'mma be waiting for that, I'mma be waiting for that

Misery—you represent love, you the epitome
So wish for me, I'll come out of nowhere—your epiphany
Disconnect from everybody
Who don't understand my vision yet
In a jet is where my mind is so I light another cigarette
To calm me down
So calm me down
Everybody who can save me now is not around, chopper down
Busy today, but can you tell me how tomorrow sounds?
In between, purgatory ain't as bad as it would seem to be
Live a dream, that's so cliché
But I can't tell you what it means to me

You take away the pain and I thank you for that
If I ever get the chance, bet I'm paying you back
I'mma be waiting for that, I'mma be waiting for that

And so it is to the printing press...
To the recorder of man's deeds—the keeper of his conscience
—the courier of his news—that we look for strength and assistance—confident that with your help, man will be what he was born to be—free and independent...
1, 2, 3, pop, pop

Snowflakes keep falling on my expired debit cards
Don't know why I'm still awake, I gotta be up at 10 tomorrow
Missiles in my repertoire, I'd say I'm pretty regular
I never leave my house, I don't know why I got an extra car (skrt)
My pool-house studio is covered up with pencil marks
And everyday is full of jokers like a deck of cards (hahaha)
So, I'm so lonely, there's horns on my dome-piece (dome-piece)
But, I'm not the devil, I'm a motherfucking Minotaur

My conscious so weak I need to split it up in 7 parts (okay)
Revis brought me out to Cali for the first time
Went to Amar'e's party, took tequila shots with Kevin Hart (ahh)

The rap diablo, free your mind my motto
And we all gonna be good if TreeJ ever hit the lotto (we’re motherfuckin’ rich!)
So arigato, so shit, you know I'm world famous

Cause you never gonna know if your girl fake it
I'm always faded, getting shaded in the basement
I just bought a cello, now all I do is play it (play it)
Thank God that I made it (made it), ask Q where Dave is (where is he)
He'll probably tell you that he's rolling midnights out in Vegas (7 minutes!)
When I'm in my spaceship, my face is so complacent
Wear a suit to cash a check, we're going to the banquet (ching)
And Jimmy got the burner, but he don't wanna murder
And Clockwork somewhere out in Sweden speaking Danish like

That man must be a alien, I really can't explain it, shit
It's just a little cocaine sniff (sniff)
But the lines is longer than parades is (aahhh)
I think it's time to give me all your praises (praises)
So I can get this money and give all the homies raises (raises)
My life is on these words, this is my affidavit
And if you wanna legal battle, send your ass to David (that's my lawyer)
I'm half man-half amazing
Probably half God, but that don't fit my calculations (don't make no sense)
I know the planet Earth is about to explode
Kinda hope that no one save it, we only grow from anguish

So me and Q put people on the label we don't remember
Smiled as I saw Jerm, nerding out with Josh Berg
Talking interlocutor, and drinking Arnold Palmer
Any other room, watching C-Span with E. Dan
Laying down the baseline, doing drums with his freehand (how the hell does he do that ?!)
When I was in first grade, I wished to be Puerto Rican
My mom took me to a barbershop to get some cornrows
I walked in, ready for them Sprewell braids
But the lady said my hair was too short though,(aw), man
I always thought my moms was the illest for that shit
Driving through the hood she did not have a reaction (skrt)
With a 6 year old she kept the doors unlocked
And drove by the 5-0 like “fuck those cops!”
God damn, it just don't stop (nah)
I know my father probably wish I would just smoke pot (puffs)

And looking down like we come in peace (oh, me too)
I told Will and Bill they need to kick the habit (down)
We on the same trip, we just got different baggage (it's brown)

Soul!
Ever since a nigga had recess
Mothafucka felt like a grownup (Soulo)
Momma come and bitch about a curfew
I was still playing 'round the corner
7 years old saw my first porno, damn, that fucked me up
At 10 I bust my first nut on this older ho gut, but so what
Let's recap, the earth spinning too rapid
I'm living too fast, sinning's a habit
I can't hack, fornicate, act this rabid
One bean short of an acid tablet
Security guards spark my cigarettes
The old head go 'head and cop me a brew
Sometimes them Koreans be cool
These shades make me look 22
They say you learn when you get older
I just say that that ain't true
That just means when you was younger
You ain't get turnt up like us, fool
Just got L's so I'm riding high, still in high school but I do
Everything I will do, when I'm 25, no lie

I was young with ambition, fucked around with these hoes
Never needed permission, went and lived the life that I chose
Premonition-type visions, you see the world as it goes
Tell 'em all what they missing, while I watch it as it unfolds
I'm dodging my death, confident kid
I was tryna grow up with the best
Watching my step, never no college plan
Found myself nodding off always on test-day
I coulda been a great graduate
Woulda got one of them hoes from "The Bachelor"
Could've been smart, could've been a doctor
Life full of drama, little soap opera
Falling in love, lucky that I caught ya
Almost got her knocked up, would've been a father
All about energy, make good memories
I'm the fucking Dalai Lama
Only 18 but I had my own business
Then I got fame like "what the fuck is this?"
Whole bunch of cameras, fake ass bitches
Everyone around wanna treat me all different
Oh I'm cool, cause I got money
Back in high school none of these hoes was tryna fuck me
I thought it was a conspiracy
Sometimes my thoughts start scaring me
You a parody, hilarity, that funny shit's for the parakeets

They, they, they been looking for somebody like me
Big bag of weed and a muddy iced tea
Something brand new, wonder what it might be
Coughing off them drugs, moving at a nice speed
If you're 18 years and older, 18 years and older
If you're 18 years and older, 18 years and older

I wanna rule the world, take care of my family
And take care of my girl, plant a couple seeds
Blaze a gang of trees
Went to see a rated R movie about me
They said you must be
18 years and older, 18 years and older
18 years and older, 18 years and older
18 years and older
Long days, longer nights
You keep startin' fights think you always right
Call you up to tell you I ain't comin' home tonight
Say you wanna leave me, it's just talkin' but I know you might
Now get along, I get along, I go
You sing along, to every song that you know
You play your part, I'm playin' mine
You breakin hearts, ain't breakin' mine
Since growing old is takin' time, I'm actin' like I'm 8 or 9
Trying to move on, talking to my old friends
See me, say what up and I'm actin' like I don't know them
Causing so much problems, why you doin' that, doin' that
Ripping people's hearts out, are you too cute for that, cute for that
I been on the same shit
We run into each other and it's like we don't even speak the same language
I guess people always going through changes
Didn't think I would lose you once I got famous

Said baby I got missed calls and e-mails
All going into detail
About how you just not happy and you think you gotta leave so
Go, go, I'll be fine on my own, own
Said baby I got missed calls and e-mails
All going into details 'bout how you used to love me
I keep changing like the leaves, hell
Go, go, you'll be fine on your own, own

She tell me, "You an asshole, superficial douche bag
Wishing that you knew that, you could have these shoes back
All of this perfume back, necklaces and jewels back
All the shit you buy me she said, "I want you back
I can't be seen again with you and all of your friends
It's so hard to pretend that it's like it was way back when
I thought you used to be the one, I guess you don't have time
Cause all you do is grind and it's got me losin' my mind
You just don't, don't, don't love me like you used to
Think I'm bout to lose you"
I'mma end this now before things just confuse you
Kept breakin' promises you said you'd keep
So you can leave a message at the beep

Said baby I got missed calls and e-mails
All going into detail
About how you just not happy and you think you gotta leave so
Go, go, I'll be fine on my own, own
Said baby I got missed calls and e-mails
All going into details 'bout how you used to love me
I keep changing like the leaves, hell
Go, go, you'll be fine on your own, own
Where are you?
Ohhhhh-ohhh (hehehe)
Ohhhhh
The Divine Feminine, an album by Mac Miller
Ohhhhh-ohhh
(The Divine Feminine, hehehe)
(The Divine Feminine, hehehe)
Ohhhhh

Am I supposed to? Okay... love
Love, love, love, love, love (sex)
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love (sex)

This sun don't shine when I'm alone
I lose my mind and I lose control
I see your eyes look through my soul
Don't be surprised, this all I know
I felt the highs and they felt like you
See a love like mine is too good to be true
And you too divine to just be mine
You remind me of the color blue
Girl I'm so in love with you, yeah
Girl I'm so in love with you
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Um, well, baby
You were everything I ever wanted
Bought a wedding ring, it's in my pocket
Planned to ask the other day
Knew you'd run away, so I guess I just forgot it
Remember when you went away to college
Hours on the phone, we end up talkin'
Past, present, future, all the gossip, God damn
Puppy love ain't what it was, darlin'
Feelings that we have are so alarmin'
I can make you laugh, I can break the glass
If we made it last, it'd be a bargain
Mr. Charmin', that is my department
You was there before the fancy cars and
You was there when I was just a starvin' artist
When the car was havin' trouble startin'
Now we got our own apartment, same box for the mail
Same hamper for the laundry, the food in the fridge is stale
And this mornin' you cooked the eggs with the kale
I tried to hit it while you was gettin' dressed
You said "All you ever think about is sex"
I'm like, "Oh well, you know me so well
And if this will make you late, I swear, I won't tell
And every time I call your phone, you better pick up your cell
I swear to God I'ma freak out if it go straight to voice mail"
Well, I'm the jealous type
But I swear that ass what Heaven's like
When I'm in that pussy, it's a better life
That's the only way I'm tryna end the night
That's my only chance, I better get it right

Take your time, my baby
Cause I'm waitin' for you, for you
I know I make your mind go crazy
Cause I'm waitin' right here for you, for you

You get closer with, run away
All I ever known is the color gray
Your loveliness bring me sunshine
I found an angel so divine
Heaven probably not the same without you
But now you're in my world, in my world
Ahhhh, ahhhh
Ahhhh, ahhhh
"Okay, you work a God damn lousy job, you know
You come home at night, you're tired
What are you going to do? Go to a movie? Turn on your radio?
Hell no you're going to get a bottle of whiskey and drink it
And go down to a bar and maybe get in a fist fight
And meet some bitch, something's going on
Then you'll go to work the next day, and do your simple little things, right?"

Yeah, Yeah, yeah
My bitch can tell that I'm addicted to pussy, she looking past it
The smile that she faking is tragic, hate looking at it
That magic I tried to grasp it, she's had it with the dramatics
Fantasizing love so classic, attracted to what she got up in her attic
Can we mind fuck?
Do I lie when I look inside her eyes? Hush don't say a word
I know I make you hurt, sorry is my favorite word
I don't deserve your trust, but can we make it work?
I hate to end the story, can we wait until the morning to decide on it?
Spend this time pretending it was that first summer
We was pure lovers
She was used to being hurt, I took that curse from her
Sometimes I wonder what it's all for
You wish that I would call more
You're sick of seeing condoms in my sock drawer
Loves turns to war so quickly
I envisioned us - married and 50
Couple of kids that we drop off at little league
I'm addicted to you
You only want the best, I need to listen to you
I'm fucking other girls wishing it's you
Fuck the bullshit, we in love
I'm a mess, but can you clean me up?

Girl I'm the worst
Yea, I know that I'm the worst
Yea, but you're something I can't lose
Let me just tell you the truth, that'd be a first
Girl I'm the worst
Yea, I know that I'm the worst
Don't know what I gotta do, just love you so much that it hurts

And I see you falling victim to the thirst
All the sins you committed you could probably use a couple minutes in church
But, for what it's worth, I think you're perfect
There's an angel hiding underneath your surface
Yeah, the woman of my dreams, I'm looking at her sleep
The pussy right in-front of me, I shouldn't be so weak
What did I do to deserve a love like this?
You see her shining? That's my sunlight bitch
I'm sick of fighting, that smile is so inviting
I see you every time I'm writing
I'm losing to all my vices, they kicking my ass
I hold on to this feeling, I wish it would last
Don't wanna lose you for some evil I did in the past
You knew I fucked that bitch and you didn't react?
Girl, it's me and you, how simple is that?
Gave me all your love and now I'm giving it back
But I know, that

Girl you the worst
Yea, you know that you the worst
But I'm something you can't lose
If you just told me the truth, that'd be a first, but
Girl you the worst
Yea, you know that you the worst
Every time you say you sorry, everything you do just feel like it's rehearsed
Take me to euphoria according to the story of a warrior
Picturing my visions as you look inside my cornea

I been waiting so long
Been waiting to have you by my side (tell you "I love you")
I can't do no wrong, no you are an angel
With you by my side, you are my euphoria
And when you look in my eyes
The pain goes a-way, euphoria (euphoria)
You feel so damn good, I want you to know that
Just come take my hand closer so hear me out
We could go to the moon
Look at my eyes as we land
We're here now

Euphoria (Euphoria)
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Oh oh oh oh

Now when you lay in my arms the pain goes a-way, euphoria

Euphoria (Euphoria)
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Oh oh oh oh
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Oh oh oh oh
Euphoria
Euphoria
(Euphoria)

And when you're mine, I won't let you go
The pain, it can't stay (euphoria)
Euphoria (Euphoria)
Sometimes I wonder who the fuck I am
Sometimes I wonder who the fuck I am
Uhhhhhh
Yeah, want you to feel it
I want you all to feel it
So step up on the mic and uhh
Show them what you got tiger

Sometimes I wonder who the fuck I am
So I've been lookin' in the mirror and it still don't make no sense
I'm askin' what am I supposed to do?
I've done so much in my short lifetime, but I haven't done shit
I done flew around the whole world
First I shook a million hands and I took a million pictures
But I'm a hostage in my own world
And my thoughts my own enemy, got no time for these bitches
I got too much on my damn mind
So if I add some more stress, I just don't see how I'm a cope
I think they underestimate the grind
I do, bring this dough, and I'm only 20 years old
I wonder why I sip this devil juice
Cause it feel incredible, problems, I got several
Thank God that none of that medical
Ugh, I've been blessed with much to be expected

What am I doing here?
I wonder what am I doing here
What am I doing here
What am I doing here

I hope this feelin' lasts for fuckin' ever
I don't want to come back down, let me stay above the ground
I hope I do what I was meant to do
Cause I've been searchin' for that answer, I just hope I get it now
Please, let me find euphoria
When you up above the clouds, like, who goin' to touch me now
And do we ever get to know the truth?
Cause everyone seems to have it, but to me it seems they lack it
Now I'm rollin' and I'm sippin' lean
Sometimes I catch a buzz just to help me picture love
Drinkin' liquor and I'm smokin' weed
And you don't ever do too much if you could never do enough
Wonder why it's me instead of you
I'll be there to rescue you, problems you got several
Thank God that none of that medical
Ugh, I've been blessed with much to be expected

What am I doing here?
I wonder what am I doing here
What am I doing here
What am I doing here

Uh, sittin' in my Bentley,  thinkin' bout these hoes
All I do is kill them, I kill them like Nicole
Simpson, flag crimson, smoke em' like Winstons
I just bought a new chopper, I treat it like an infant
I'm lightin' up a stogie, It's longer than a hoagie
Situation's gettin' fishy and I don't eat anchovies
Fuck the world, kill em' all, she answer when I call
If the cops pull us over, she gon' hide it in her drawers
See I come from a place where stars never shine
And drama is accepted, credit cards are declined
Everybody gotta die, but I ain't everybody
If that ho play with me, I whoop that chick like Terrence Howard
I'm a pimp, I ain't lyin', but that is not important
I'm just tryna to buy time, but can't really afford it
Sayin' ain't that a bitch, but I hope that bitch is bad
I feel like money in the trash, like—
Whoa! Yeah, Young Mula Baby!

What am I doing here?
I wonder what am I doing here
What am I doing here
What am I doing here
Woo-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

(Fuck you)
I came for whoever is in charge
I suggest you go and get yourself a weapon and a guard
They need some coffee, everybody’s sleeping on me
Going around door to door, setting off alarms
All that horse shit, you should have left it at the barn
Keep a stallion, tell her gallop to the store and get cigars, yeah
Too many whips, gotta get a new garage made
I might steal one just to drive it in a car chase
Me and my bizarre ways (Lord have mercy)
I moved up from a Private to a Sergeant
You can see it from a scar face
Hidden in a dark place, swimming in the shark tank
Give a bitch a little bit of change, she a game in an arcade
(Time crisis) Not a second to lose
I’m the motherfuckin' Bible, that’s forever the truth
And this is not another case of the celebrity blues
The devil with me and he tell me to shoot

Murder, murder, murder, what would you do?
Have you ever had to hurt her? Just for something to do
Can you draw a perfect circle?
Lot of lies cover the truth, you got options, what do you do?
I wash these pills down with liquor and fall
Leave it to me, I do enough for us all (I do)
Got what you need if you like breaking the law
My mother raised me a God (Hey)
(Fuck you)

Yeah, blame the drugs, got me sinning on the weekday
Drunk as fuck, doing buck sixty on the freeway
Giving y'all the freebase, hidden in the middle of a briefcase
Hidden in a subwoofer, beat case
Used to wanna know how a freak taste
Now I’m in it in an instant like replay
Broad’s a baton, pass it off like relay
Why I’m so mad on my B-Day?
She say “I thought you got sober”
And I say “I wish you’d stop being a bitch
And get to minding your business”
Told me “Money has changed you”
I get to thinking, how rarely do I visit?
How’d I get so egotistical? I’m a Buffalo Soldier
Heaven is a mile away, the trouble, much closer
I’m only twenty-three but my mind is older, and it’ll forever be
Dead presidents to the homies, death to my enemies

Murder, murder, murder, what would you do?
Have you ever had to hurt her? Just for something to do
Can you draw a perfect circle?
Lot of lies cover the truth, you got options, what do you do?
I wash these pills down with liquor and fall
Leave it to me, I do enough for us all
Got what you need if you like breaking the law
My mother raised me a God (Hey)
(Fuck you)

A goddess told me “good morning” when I woke up
(Fuck you)
You know I had a good morning when I woke up
(Fuck you)
Gotta thank God every morning then I woke up
(Fuck you)
Would you remember me if I never woke up?
Bye bye (Fuck you)
I've been a sinner, I’m just tryna stay
Warm through winter, and I’ll be on my way
I’m just a drifter, in endless seas of whispers
I just need some shelter, give me shelter from the wind

Woo-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system
412-9….  is not available

“Hey man, I wish you were here, happy holidays
Uhm, I love ya. And I hope you have a good night / weekend
/ I hope I talk to you soon, alright, godspeed”


Oh yeah, I thought I’d have it figured out by now
Shit would be simple, problems would be in the past by now
Me and the homies would be sitting on millions
Reminiscing on times when we were so broke
And living in Oakland just chillin'
I thought I’d have it in the bag by now
I thought that we’d be kicking back by now
I know that life is a bitch, I know that life is a bitch
I thought we’d put her in a cab by now
But I’m stressing, I can’t relax
I swallow my pride and I’m hiding what’s making me mad
Everybody saying I need rehab
Cause I’m speedin' with a blindfold on and won’t be long
‘til they watching me crash
And they don’t wanna see that
They don’t want me to OD and have to talk to my mother
Telling her they could have done more to help me
And she’ll be crying saying that she’ll do anything to have me back
All the nights I’m losing sleep, it was all a dream
There was a time that I believed that
But white lines be numbing them dark times
Them pills that I’m popping, I need to man up
Admit it’s a problem, I need a wake up
Before one morning I don’t wake up
You make your mistakes, your mistakes never make ya
I’m too obsessed with going down as a great one
But if you wait too long, they go find someone to replace ya
So I guess this is a letter, to all my brothers, Most Dope, that’s forever
I love you more than words could express
And this the part that Q start crying, if he ain’t already yet
I did my best to be a leader you respect
At times I became weaker, got defeated by regret
So tell my baby I love her
And if she give me the chance I’ll put a seed inside her, make her a mother
Just know that there’s a place
Where all my people worry free and everybody straight
Every devil don’t got horns, and every hero ain’t got capes
Opened up my eyes, shit, I’m finally awake, Good morning
Yeah, good morning

Yo Vin, it’s the morning, you gotta go to work
“alright”
Yo, you gotta be at work in like ten minutes, yo
(You good?)
“I’m straight, yo what’s good?” (when you going?)
You gotta pick up the dry cleaning and shit still?
“man, fuck that shit, I’ll skip”
You bout to go to work?
“mmm”
Ight, what time you gotta be at work?
“I don’t know…. soon”
You Democrat or Republican?
“Uuhh…I don’t know anymore”
Would you vote for a female president?
“I don’t care what gender or race you are”
Get high, breaking laws
Get high, breaking laws

Yeah, okay, I wake up with the taste of pussy still in my mouth
Bitch in my bed, homegirl still asleep on the couch
My head is banging like Metallica, swallow a bottle of Advil up
Then head back to the bedroom where she suck me dry like
Dracula
It's the young miraculous, mister love-to-grab-his-nuts
Never let a bitch inside, fuck her in the Acura
Aurora borealis with the shine, my aura gorgeous
Dinner with forty courses, bunch of horny whores and fornicate
To formulate a fortune, more in the race of horses I am
My homies got my back, they all Verizon, man
I bring this to you like lalalalala-live man
You gon' need at least five hands to hold my finance
I am fe, fi, fo, fum, the giant
The best thing out of Pittsburgh since Clemente with the Pirates
I tell them "shhh" this middle finger sign for silence
Ain't a fuckin' way I'm keeping quiet

Yeah, I been riding through the city
Blowing smoke out the window
Cops out on patrol, they looking out for all the criminals
I been a lot of things, I ain't ever been a bitch though
Rules to this game, you know how this shit go
Get money, fuck the system, break the law
Get money, fuck the system, break the law
Get money, fuck the system, break the law
Oh no (br-br-br-break the law)
La, la, la

So many people told me that I wouldn't be shit
But now I walk around with money and my hand on my dick
I think I'm special
I'm drinking whiskey out the bottle 'til I black out
One million, two million, shit I'm losing track now
Coming to you live inside the crack house
Started with a dub and then I made it to a half ounce
Then I turned it to a pound,  turned that to a house
Turned that to a career, how the fuck did I get here?
Spending all your time just getting high will drive you crazy
I killed the game like Jeffrey Dahmer did the 80's
Speeding down the freeway getting head in my Mercedes
Giving me all of this money was crazy, shoulda known better
No pressure, dope seller, smarter than your professor
Hoes, I don't stress her, put a bitch down like Old Yeller
The flow's stellar, stella ella ola, have you ever been?
Shit I probably could've been the president

Yeah, riding through the city blowing smoke out the window
Cops out on patrol looking out for all the criminals
I been a lot of things, I ain't ever been a bitch though
Rules to this game, you know how this shit go
Get money, fuck the system, break the law
Get money, fuck the system, break the law
Get money, fuck the system, break the law
Oh no, (br-br-br-break the law)
La, la, la

Get money, fuck the system, break the law
Get money, fuck the system, break the law
Get money, fuck the system, break the law
Break the law, br-br-br-break the law
Break the law
Break the law
Break the law
La la la la la la la la la
I just be like fuck you, what you need?

You can keep on grillin', I'mma smile back, smile back
I just be like fuck you, what you need?
You can't get nothin' from me
You was talkin' shit, now I'm somebody you would love to be
I'mma do my thing until the day the reaper come for me
You can keep on grillin', I'mma smile back, smile back

Tell them haters, call your army, bring your tanks
I'm a big boy with a big boy bank
Self-employed, independent, once you start, don't take no breaks
Work until I get it, I bet it's gon take a second
But once I start up my engine I'm gone, too fast to catch him
I'm Lennon mixed up with UGK, maybe try that purple drink
What I'm on is strong, yours weaker than seven days
Sweeter than creme brulee, presidential head of state
Dopest mothafucka since before I hit the seventh grade
Elevate, Buddha shit. Cooler than what coolest is
Slick without no lubricant, bullshit, you just full of it
Stupid bitch, keep on hatin', I'mma keep on doin' it
Spend a day as me, boy you couldn't get the shoes to fit

I just be like fuck you, what you need?
You can't get nothin' from me
You was talkin' shit, now I'm somebody you would love to be
I'mma do my thing until the day the reaper come for me
You can keep on grillin', I'mma smile back, smile back
I just be like fuck you, what you need?
You can't get nothin' from me
You was talkin' shit, now I'm somebody you would love to be
I'mma do my thing until the day the reaper come for me
You can keep on grillin', I'mma smile back, smile back

They used to tell me I was fake, they would hate, now they on my dick
Most Dope is my family, have respect for my conglomerate
Rollie on my wrist, I ain't rich, but I'm still coppin' shit
Jerm is on the beat, he got that heat, hold up, drop it quick
And bring it back
I could change the world with just a single track
Underage table in the back, smokin', drinkin' yak
Pittsburgh, let me show the world just where my city at
On the map, illest city out, I guess that's just a fact
I'mma live in Rome, drink Patron and have a ball
After all, only get one life, so there's no time to stall
I'mma do it, stupid dudes with all exclusive shit to move with
Just a few kids tryna bullshit, still my boys I straight up grew with

I just be like fuck you, what you need?
You can't get nothin' from me
You was talkin' shit, now I'm somebody you would love to be
I'mma do my thing until the day the reaper come for me
You can keep on grillin', I'mma smile back, smile back
I give a fuck less and less everyday
The more you give a fuck, I guess the less you make (Money)
Homie we just out here tryna elevate
Heaven is a crime scene, stand behind the yellow tape
I started making money in eleventh grade
Soon as I learned that the more you do, the less you wait
Got a bigger crib, always use the extra space
Shit was so different in 2008
Growing pains, fill the open veins with Novocain
Relapse, I eat that, I don't complain
I'm just rambling
You want war, send N64 Blitz champions (Sucker)
Out of space channeling, brain damaging
Heavy rain game cancelling, proud to be American
They tell me "Get yourself straight
How much more money can you make?"

I'm just tryna grow up old and rich
Maybe get married to a local bitch
I be, I be, I be, I be over shit
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness
I'm just tryna grow up old and rich
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness
I be, I be, I be, I be over shit
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness

I'm a deranged motherfucker, took too many uppers
Now it's rush hour, Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker
I stuck around for the past six summers
Karma is a bitch and that bitch don't love ya
We was in the attic you could smell the weed
Bitches getting naked, we was selling E
Bitches kissing bitches just like Ellen D
In the kitchen whipping biscuits, giving generously
I thank the lord I made it out, no STD
Lost a few too many brain cells, I'm special needs
They tell me "Get yourself straight
How much more money can you make?"

I'm just tryna grow up old and rich
Maybe get married to a local bitch
I be, I be, I be, I be over shit
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness
I'm just tryna grow up old and rich
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness
I be, I be, I be, I be over shit
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness

Ladies and gentlemen in attendance, good morning
It's the baby face Don Dada checking in
And I want you to know
It ain't about complaining, it's about maintaining
Know what I'm talking about
Don't ever become content because you will repent
Feel that, go get it
That's your life, go live it
Pass me my Hennessy and my Grand Marnier
If you will
Yo, I'm fucking zooted right now in the fucking bathroom, dog. And, you know what I'm saying, I'm just recording this shit cause I feel like I got so much fucking shit to say and like, you know what I'm saying, this is the only way that I'ma get it out

Yeah, can I get the little bit of reverb on my voice?
I'm trying to hide from something, I just don't know what
Oh, it's not sad baby, you know
(Between heaven and hell)
Yeah, um, I saw a mountain, you know across the horizon
When I got there realized it was just a pile of rocks
Yeah, so God damn

I wonder if everybody hope
That this song is not depressing as the last one was
Cause Heaven smell like Nag Champas
Come here darling, ash my blunt (Smoke)
Waiting on hallucination, ain't a single fact I trust (No)
Dear family, my sanity go down when my cash go up
Rap too much, how the fuck to get through the verse
I came from house parties
Find a bitch and go through her purse
All I need is a little good pussy and whole lot universe
I met God before I ever stepped into a church
And that motherfucker still owe me money
Ohhh I need a religion to follow
I swear to God that I got more problems
Than there is bitches in Carlow
Lord have Murciélago, yeah
And I don't know how the fuck I'm supposed
To look into my parents eyes when I'm scared to die
My eyes same color as a cherry pie
Woah, see I'm terrified
Crucifix heavy, who gon' carry mine?
Yeah, what's with all this talk about Hell and Satan
And sleep deprivation
If this is planet Earth, then my hell's a basement

Ascension
A brand new me
Yeah, yeah
Why you wanna do me like that, Miss Conception?
Between heaven and hell
What's between heaven and hell?
A brand new me
Oh it's a brand new me

Okay, if I could tell these kids one thing
Just make sure handle your business
A criminal leave no witness
And don't ever trust these bitches
What happened to your life when your house become a home
Where your children at? Where your children at?
You got two sons, all they do is fight
You up through the night like gimme-gimme-gimme that
Yeah, nice titties, got a pic, go and send me that
Sendak books, can you give her that?
Fuck rap, make a million off a shitty app
Yeah, smoke trees in the cab
Pittsburgh, show you where the city at
And don't forget that H, get you smacked in your face
Got so many sons, I was young, now they half my age
90K out in Portugal, smile on my face, backlit stage
My bitch batshit crazy and that shit fascinates me
Yeah, on my tongue where the tab is
And it burn like battery acid
I was in the backs of my classes
By the kids having asthma attacks
Cause he panicked every single time he sat on his glasses
Every Wonderland have a Alice
Yeah, but I'm a king God can I have a chalice
I'm demanding the truth, put your hands to the roof
Be a man, that's a challenge

Ascension
(Challenge, are you up for that challenge)
A brand new me
Yeah, yeah
(Yeah, everybody got to have balance)
Why you wanna do me like that, Miss Conception?
Between heaven and hell (Salvation)
What's between heaven and hell?
(And the underworld, welcome to Heaven
But I gotta keep that bitch waiting)
A brand new me (Fascinating)
Oh it's a brand new me
(And that's fascinating, please be a little patient)

Ooh, I ain't a doctor, could you be a little patient?
Yeah, be a little patient
Everything will be okay then, if you be a little patient
One world, one nation, done waiting
Yeah, yeah, um
Now I'm still sipping moonshine
We discovered a new high, me and Jerm done this a few times
Yeah, but who's high now
(I can't believe I done changed my life around)
Talk a lot of shit but will you die now
(I been wanting to cry over this shit. Every day I think about fucking dying)
What you gonna do when everybody die out, just go die out
Let's ride out
Be without fear in the face of your enemies
Be brave and upright that God may love thee
Speak the truth even if it leads to your death
Safeguard the helpless and do no wrong
This is your oath
Yeah, yeah so how's it feel?
Can you feel it?

Polo pajamas, I think I made it
I show my mom my first millions, she damn near fainted
The rich and famous, so nice to make your acquaintance
The legends put out the latest, I feel that it sound outdated
I'm the hardest working person in the universe
Temptation victim to the church of Lucifer
Internet rappers ain't shit when no computers work
You spent your whole advance on two chains and a Gucci verse (a Gucci verse?)
I'm the greatest, admit it, I'm the greatest
And I don't hold a grudge against anybody who hated
I'm underrated, don't fit on nobody's playlist
If I ain't in your top 10 then you're a racist
Cocaine ether creates a strange creature
They wasn't hearing me 'till I fucked with a Brainfeeder
I'm still playing it out the same speakers
I did it all without a Drake feature!

So many things that I've created
But this right here might be my favorite
They ask me how I feel, I say "amazing"
I feel amazing
So many things that I've created
But this right here might be my favorite

Brand new home, I think I made it
Key to the city, I keep to open the gates with
A briefcase with a million under the pavement
That's just on some rainy day shit, yeah
The kids getting murdered that I grew up with
They shooting up doing drugs or they doing nothing
My girl's parents still living out in the hood
I come through in that new Beamer like the shit all good
Damn, I'm just a human let me make mistakes
Shit has changed ain't little Malcolm with a baby face
Even my homies tell me take a break
They know it ain't their place, and this a day I hate to waste
Trying to be a legend by tomorrow
They say I can't, I'm determined to prove em' wrong though
I'm not perfect but they ain't either
I did it all without a Jay feature!

Every time it sound brand new

It's alright, it's okay

Yeah, okay, and time will tell
If I'm alive and well, cause when I'm by myself
I find that I keep flying high, sometimes I must remind myself
That change is more than pennies laying on the floor inside the well
You cross my mind, do not apologize for being fine as hell
I'm spinning here inside your spell, my mind has start to wander
I missed a day, I stay up late admiring your posture

And you, always wonderin' what we'll be
I say we sound better than you or me

Baby you could be my...
Yeah, well okay, it's alright, it's okay
And baby you can be my...
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay

Yes we are sweet babe
And I can see, I can see, so much better

And carefully, precious things fall apart
Just let them be, let it be, forever
Oh, loving me, in spite of me
Bless your heart, bless your heart
I can breathe, I can breathe so much better, yeah

We are we, we are we, forever

Well okay, it's alright, it's okay
Said you could be my...

You gotta deal with Mac Miller, bitch
Hehehehahah
You feel like you're alone, Will? You have a soulmate? Somebody who challenges you. I'm talking about someone who opens up things for you—touches your soul. You can't give back to them, you know. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're always afraid to take the first step because all you see is every negative thing ten miles down the road. You can do anything you want, you are bound by nothing...

Yeah, are you my soulmate?
My angel, what do you want with me?
Too high, slow pace
My eyes closed, your body all I see
I think you're too divine for my human mind
When I'm with you, what do you do? Bring me to life
No matter what, one day everyone dies
You think you a God 'til you run out of time
Yeah, when you're gone, what will you leave behind?
Yeah, do I belong sometime soon, where goes my mind?

You were the one to show me
Divine love, love, love, love
Where was you when I was lonely
My divine love, love, love, love?
When the stereo plays our songs, sounds so clear
Baby, where'd you go? What's so wrong?
I'm right here...

Yeah, why do you stay on my case?
I try to make you feel okay
Do you know I'm in pain?
I give you clues, you misconstrue
You continue to push me far away
Why don't you come on in?
It's like you forgot my face
I just wanna taste of everything you're made of
We ain't (nothing)
Cut the strings, my balloon, watch me fly
Yeah, when are you coming through to free my mind?
Are you happy with your life?
Can I come and satisfy? Open up, let me inside
When you take off all your clothes, I'm under your control
Rollin' up, you get me high

You were the one to show me
Divine love, love, love, love
Where was you when I was lonely
My divine love, love, love, love?
When the stereo plays our songs, sounds so clear
Baby, where'd you go? What's so wrong?
I'm right here...

Cover Art:
Uhh, ch'yeah, uh
Dedicated too, this dedicated to... fuck it

Uh, I got a pocket full of posies
Some devil with a pitchfork keep talking like he know me
I'm psychopathic, low key, my hyperactive dome piece
Get no sleep, ill as fuck, the hospitals seem so weak
I stood before an Angel as he told me bout the glory
Put me in a room of people, how the fuck could I be lonely?
I only get money, these labels tryna clone me
Uh, my thoughts get heavy, hit the ground and crack the concrete
So, I try to keep 'em in my head
It's sad to see when everything that you believe is dead
Word to Heavy D, and rest in peace to all that come and pass
Life is good sometimes, but it just doesn't last
A bunch of stress, you see this mic is like my punching bag
Rock 'n' roll, drugs and cash, you softer than a bubble bath
Sucka ass mothafucka, mothafucka's sediment
Doper than the shit that killed Chris Tucker in Dead Presidents
Desert rhymes, homie, riding beats, I'm on a camel
I'm way too hot to handle, life a beach, I brought my sandals
You want a war? I got a lot of ammo
You ain't a soldier cause you rocking camo
Young Rambo, hundred million fans though
And I do it big, you a iPod Nano
Fire on wax, look like I rock candles
Yeah you got a show, but you ain't on my channel

That's HBO bitch, you gotta pay for that, your channel's free
(I'm gonna fucking kill you)
Um, Imaxin' shit mothafucka, yeah, suck my dick

Hey, ayo, I'm 'bout to start gambiling with Ambien, I'm dutch smoking
That's a strike but fuck bowling, I could tear a pin of Maryland
See, I'm American, apparently it's damaging
To be in front of cameras in your underwear with Marilyn
Monroe, looking dumb hoes who want to much dough
And come close to have you straight tripping when you jump rope
Don't rock the love boat, this business fucking cut throat
And it's gonna crack if you just paint the wall with one coat
Rooms filled with blunt smoke, peep me through the fog
These rappers who be hating probably need to get a job
See, me I'm with my squad, getting money, living comfortable
I know a couple hoes who model, but they ugly though
Fuck a toast, y'all is fucking broke, cut ya throat
Judging me is nothing dope, boy you lying under oath
God made the world, why did man make the scriptures?
And if he created Lennon, why'd he go and make a Hitler?
I could take a photo, but I'd rather paint a picture
Of the one Laurence Fishburne, we'll shoot up all you hipsters
I'm from Pittsburgh, that's black and gold
If my skin gets filled up, I'mma tat my soul
Running out of paper, writing on my hand
Hundred thousand haters writing 'bout my jams
Want a number one independent album? I'm your man
I'mma hit Preme and leave you all right where you stand

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Sample
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

You hide your skin like you're shy or there's something wrong
You stylish when you got nothin' on, yeah
And all I do is make these fuckin' songs
So finally I made a fuckin' song
And now she comin' closer
Hope she crawls, she wanna jump my bones
You want it don't ya?
I was a soldier, now I'm comin' home, the war is over
Kick down the door, I hold your bends, you never break
You need to smell your sweet aroma
See I knows you smell like cinnamon, kissin' your lips
I lick my fingertips and get your clitoris in the mix
My dick on business trips
My tongue twistin' is ticklin' just a little bit
I'm swimmin' inside of your skin like a river
In the Caribbean

It's okay that you like it babe (I like it baby)
And it's alright that you misbehave
It's okay to be this way (this way)
To live this way baby baby (ooh baby)
Chillin' with the AC

That's just the way that we are
You and me, super freaks here we are
I'm takin' care of each and every part
I opened up your legs and go straight for your heart

Said I'm too divine, I'm too divine yeah, too divine
Who am I? Well, I'm Mr. Superfly
I'm Mr. Blew your, blew your mind, hot as June, July
I wanna make you waterfall
Girl you my painting, you my art installation
Gonna fuck you, put you on the wall
All I wanna do is show you off, I want to put you on
Why would I ever blow you off?
Right now, let's go get lost
Just I've been way too hot for way too long
I'm so exhausted
Whether that's your mind or line we still get crossed
First your name is gone
Never understand until you have to stand alone
Can I have a hand to hold?
A Band-Aid for my damaged soul, I paint the planet gold
I swear I'm Michelangelo, I don't understand these hoes
They didn't want a man when it was; man I'm broke
But now they know me and what I don't need
You gon' see it's gon' be what it's gon' be

That's just the way that we are
You and me, super freaks here we are
I'm takin' care of each and every part
I opened up your legs and go straight for your heart

These hoes
These hoes
Taste this, taste, taste this
These hoes
Taste this, taste, taste this
These hoes
"I know what happens to you, me and everyone else
When they supposedly die
It's this passage around the great loop"
This music go with my funeral
Music go with my funeral

Said I was raised inside this gritty city
Riding through, you probably miss me
My bicycle fell, I hit the road, the mailman almost hit me
All this sins be more than shitty, I just pray the lord forgive me
Doing drugs is just a war with boredom but they sure to get me
My side-bitch is sort of pretty but she got enormous titties
Know I'm worth a fortune, she just want a brand new Porsche or Bentley
Had a few abortions, unfortunately, I forced them
Lord knows I turn a child to an orphan when I'm touring
I'm more than what I think of myself, I really have to be
Sit at home and drink by myself, my thoughts harassing me
Actually, as a matter of fact, she ain't getting back to me
A shame that my tragedy, my masterpiece, yeah
Trapped inside these dreams of mine
Just trying to get some peace of mind
Yeah, I've been trapped inside these dreams of mine
So you'll never get a piece of mind

It's the last day of my life
Party like it's the last day of your life
This the motherfucking last day of my life
Party like it's the last day of your life

See we swallowed in this web of lies, never try to exercise
You used to be a fantasy but now I guess it's televised
I heard the legends never died
Oh this lonely hell of mine
There never was a better time to better myself
Forever I melt and float away like waves in the ocean
Staring inside of Heaven's eyes, the gates will never open
I'm smoking on this field of hope, waiting till my deal gets closed
I keep getting hotter but all I seem to feel is cold
22 don't feel so old but I think I'm 82
You mean to tell me God took seven days and all he made was you?
I'm out here with the kangaroos, making danger, break the rules
Celebrate my date of birth with acid, get the days confused
Happiness I take from you, searching for the naked truth
I'm not awake, I'm in a lake, I'll swim away with you
Bitch, check out the butterfly
If you the truth then what the fuck am I?
Yeah

It's the last day of my life
Party like it's the last day of your life
This the motherfucking last day of my life
Party like it's the last day of your life

So where are you going?
Where are you headed?
Where are you going?
Can I come? Can I come?
Take your time, when talkin' to a nigga, I don't waste none
Knock you off your feet and then I flee before the jakes come
Sick of hearin' cases from these niggas who ain't face none
But I'ma be the nigga that they feelin' when the day come
Thirsty for the pay, young niggas led astray
Stray bullet hit my brother in his mothafuckin' face
What's fate when a person don't deserve what he get?
Shootin' reckless at the father, almost murdered the kid
Or is it karma for the shit that both the parents had did?
Ain't embarrassed where I'm livin', we get merit for kills
From a family of niggas that was veteran skilled
Voted heartless cause my momma made me part of the guild
Deals made, sellin' thrills paid the bills at the crib
Drag him down by the river, he'll be missin' for years
And them funerals was usual, ain't sheddin' no tears
Knew the fallen had it better off than most of us did
Cause shit, Heaven knows, Heaven's gates prolly closed
And these hoes in a race for the gold
We was raised on that fork in the road
No food on our plate, just the meals that we stole

Yeah, oh-woah-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh, yeah, yeah, um

I spit that prayer hand emoji, that shit that injured Kobe
The holiest of holy, Nick Nolte in some Oakley's
That's a flex though, cover up the issues that I kept close
Sober I can't deal, I'm in the corner with my head low
Runnin' from my shadow, never ending chase
Ease the pain and the battle that's within me
Sniff the same shit that got Whitney, the high heel depression
My temple feel the metal comin' out the Smith & Wesson, bang
Say a prayer, leave my brains on the tile floor
My bitch hate me, always tell me I should smile more
Off them drugs that hit you in your spinal cord
This the shit I need to keep the climate warm
Wish I could get high, space migration
Pretend I can just fly to great vibrations
The magazines need a quote
Now I'm gone, sorry I don't even know, yo

Woah-oh-oh, yeah
And this pain, and this pain
And this pain, and this pain
Mixed up with this rain, this rain
This rain, this rain, woah-woah-woah-oh-oh
Yeah, oh-woah-oh, yeah
Yeah, 9th Wonder
Woah! Yeah Woah! Yeah Okay, Okay
Yeah, Uh

We in between heaven and hell
Fuck a 9 to 5, I'd rather end up dead or in jail
American ninja to these obstacles
No stopping me, we on the move
Your mouth running like a prostitute's
Keep your head to yourself
I work harder than anybody you know
I'm done with tricks, don't need no money to blow
Deadly aim, self contained
Superstar, they yell the name
Blood diamonds, finna go to hell for my chain
The P fitted on my head though
I'm too high, you can't reach me with the cell phone
No goodbyes, no hellos
You don't want this life I live
You'd rather had the wife and kid
Shooting dice with Jesus Christ, put 20 on the midnight
To everyone who sell me drugs
Don't mix it with that bullshit, I'm hoping not to join the twenty seven club
Just want the coke dealer house with the velvet rug
Fuck the world there's no one else but us

Everything we think we love
It ain't nothing but a brand name
To everyone but us
It ain't nothing but a brand name, nothing but a brand name
Ask her what she wearing, say it's nothing but a brand name
Baby, this right here is hand made

I got brothers, I don't need no friends
My shoes off I'm comfortable, I'm chilling smoking weed again
I'm from the 'Burgh, not the burbs
Investigating my nation, homie we ain't concerned
Went from the 412 out to the 310
Went from the pavement in my basement to them yellow brick roads
See, I was on my Ps & Qs like L-M-N-O
But kicking bitches out my crib, somebody tell 'em go home, I don't know
I was in the crib with my different shit
Simple living, I'm a hypocrite
Cause I'm filthy rich, I got businesses
Been had wifey's, have mistresses
Been tryna tell you what my vision is, but y'all still ain't listening
The war ain't winning, it just beginning
And I've been 'bout Sparta like Michigan
I got stats, they got opinions, I got facts
The bro left home, but he came back
This what raised me, made me rap
PA's baby, I ain't been to PA lately
See, I left, they call me shady
I'm a white rapper, they always call me shady
Got no idea what I'm contemplating, I guess...

Everything we think we love
It ain't nothing but a brand name
To everyone but us
It ain't nothing but a brand name, nothing but a brand name
Ask her what she wearing, say it's nothing but a brand name
Baby, this right here is hand made

La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
Yeah
La, la, la, la
Everyday we love, love
Good morning
La, la, la, la
Good morning
And everyone want-
Good morning
La, la, la, la
Good morning
Yeah
See a person like me, smoke weed 'till I hallucinate
I don't know why, crazy right?
This party was dope, that shit got played quick
Yo but the bitches are freaky here

Kool-Aid and frozen pizza
It's a work of art, I ain't talking Mona Lisa
Dream of rocking crowds, see me filling up arenas
This weed got me laughing like a damn hyena
Yeah, I live a life pretty similar to yours
Used to go to school, hang with friends and play sports
Every single summer taking trips to the shore
And that was all gravy but I knew I wanted more
Ain't ever seen a young rapper like moi
Can't believe they eyes, swear its just a mirage
Still got my training wheels in the garage
But I ain't gonna need those, I'ma go hard
So far I've done pretty well for myself
Couple trophies on the shelf so what else
Could I want that I don't have yet
Well, a little more cash and my own fast jet
So I can go anywhere (anywhere) anywhere (anywhere)
Cali for the kush, cause boy I know there's plenty there
Bout to be in music stores everywhere but not yet
They can't understand my concept
I been climbing up the great wall, haven't had a fall yet
These blogs gotta know I'm on next
Clean conscience, good Samaritan
Companies send me clothes so I'm wearing 'em
If you didn't know, well I'm from the Burgh
Everything I drop recorded by Big Jerm
I smoke herb and I make music
I don't even talk about it boy, I just do it
Everybody got their own opinion, the reasons why they feeling 'em
You must admit he's killing 'em, running off adrenaline
Waiting for the game to wanna let him in, so open up
The boy a barrel of a smoking gun
Whether I'm old or young, the chosen one
I got a hundred billion flows to come
I hope you know the lyrics to every single song
So when I'm at a show everyone can sing along
My weed bag empty, bottle at it's last drop
I'm feeling like this could be my last shot
But many more songs to make cousin
So why the fuck you bugging?

Any nigga that ever looked at me wrong, (ha!) hey man, go that way B
Hey, man, I'm done holdin' back on you niggas, man, straight up, man
Y'all niggas better to go watch Montana 300 1 through 14 or something man, this 15

I been ballin
Could've skipped college
I'm a bad boy with that big popper
12 gauge when I head shot him
Bust his head open like a pinata
Like Percy Miller I've been bout it
Come find your ass like Bin Laden
I kill a clown over my guala
Don't give a fuck if it was 10 dollars
Don't trust niggas don't trust bitches
I know these ho's like a pimp scholar
And it's MOB till the day I drop
And these stupid thots don't get nada
And these dick riders try to steal from me
Gon feel the heat when that lead pop em
I whack a bitch and then walk away with blood on my shoes that's red bottoms
Bought a new gun with two clips
I can't wait to use it
And that bitch stick to my hip like I glued it
I hope you do trip as soon as you do it
I'll pull that bitch out K-9 unit
And kiss your ass goodnight, like, (bang bang) that's smooches
No top that's clueless
I'm ruthless, I do this
I'm ballin these ho's, yeah, they all on my pool stick
And you mad at your main bitch cause that bitch bumpin my new shit
Yeah the game foul and the ref dirty
Keep the green on me like a jets jersey
Tell a opposition I ain't never worried
Keep the 30 on me like I'm Stephen Curry
I can see you pussy like a miniskirt
Keep talkin you gon get it first
And the toughest with you gon' get it worst
Now go order up about 20 shirts
RIP with they face on it, had to show they ass how that semi work
Yeah they got smoked April 21st
The next time you see 'em gon' be in a hearse
Always sayin somethin' but ain't sprayin nothin'
When it's beef I don't wait for nothin'
If I see a opp broad day in public
Then I'm shootin shit like Azae Production
Got word they be out there every night
I'm talking deeper than Barry White
We gon' ride past with that iron blast
And start flipping niggas like Jessie White
They catching bullets, he Randy Moss, he Terrell Owens, he Jerry Rice
And I'm fucking monster in a pair of Mike's and this 40 on me looks very nice
I roll up like a blunt, I don't lurk bitch I hunt
Hoodie on like a monk, I'm Boyz-N-Tha-Hood with that pump
This bitch got kicked like a punt it usually sit in my trunk
But for today it's riding shotgun since niggas like to front
And if this nigga run and this nigga done, I'ma soak a nigga like he in the tub
These rappers acting like Ice Cube now tell Doughboy to come pick him up
Fuck niggas I never like 'em, got no problem with killin' one
I do real hits and don't brag about it, just rap about it, I don't give a fuck
I remember way back when we was broke, we was crying, momma high as hell
To us she was a loving mother but to other motherfuckers she was clientele
And I remember begging her to stop and every single night when I told her that
I'ma get big and buy a bunch of guns
And kill every nigga that done sold her crack
It's almost 20 years later, now she finally sober
But that was the shit that I prayed about
I thank God I made it out
Damn it feels good to go pick up my momma and take her out
Lil Tony got paper now all in my bank account, and it ain't shit to debate about
If you cross me like Jesus, I'll come back with heaters
Be outside your crib like we stakin' out
It's really fucked up in my city I'm sorry but I'm bout to add to the body count
I'll Rocky Part 4'em I'm rushin', show all you niggas exactly what I be 'bout
My choppas, they shit on them bitches, when spittin, I think they might got a potty mouth
I might come baseline like Kobe Bryant, did way back in '03 and then body yall
Keep runnin' your mouth I'ma run in your house
Paramedics they gonna' bring bodies out
I'm sonnin you niggas like J. Rock and word on the streets is that they done let Bobby out
Be strapped at the mall, strapped at the studio, you better be strapped at your momma house
When Montana hoppin' out, hollow tips poppin' out
I caught his ass takin' the garbage out
Moment of silence, text messages sent around my city, the moment they find it out
Black on black everything
We own black everything
That's the motto when we ridin' out
The ratchets stay on me, just know I was all me, whenever if ever you saw me out
Been playin' with iron, since the age of nine
Shoutout to my daddy he taught me how
My dad was a killer, my mom was an addict, a nigga grew up in a slaughterhouse
I am the one that they talk about
I am so cold that you might have to Thaw me out
That money be callin', I won't stop ballin', now I am up next like Jabari now
See niggas was sleepin' on me, but I just woke them up and they sayin' they sorry now?
I'm a dough stacking
Dope rapping, no lacking
Pole packing, Four blasting
Soul snatching, toe tagging, cold bastard
Better close your mouth or get a closed casket
Show you what I'm saying like closed captions
Put them in two, make them disappear, when I spit fire, that's old magic
I'll put the chopper to a nigga top, and then let it fly, Go-Go Gadget
Might fuck his bitch or say fuck this shit, and get straight face, that's no passion
I'm the illest nigga that you ever heard
I'm the flyest killer that you ever seen
If a fuck nigga ever jump stupid, I'ma catch a body like a trampoline
Bitch I'm Freddy Kruger in a hockey mask
About to kick door like karate class
Ask a nigga where he hide his stash
He better tell the truth like a polygraph
One false move and that shotty blast
Leave a nigga stiff like a body cast
And we don't know nothing about nothing nigga, we was out of town If somebody ask
Real shit, I'm a father first, my son's need me, I ain't bailing on them
Be with real niggas, doing real shit
If I get caught, I ain't telling on them
No tool, I ain't never going
Iron Man with that metal on him
Only God knows where the hell I'm going
Make a nigga wish he was never born
These niggas broke, put a brace on 'em
I'm super fly, put a cape on them
I'm upstairs up in Adrianna's throwing cake on them while they hate on them
From Chiraq, not Miami, but I'm wearing heat like I play for them
I'll come at night and put the nine on them
With the long clip, DeAndre Jordan, (DeAndre Jordan, DeAndre Jordan)
I'll come at night and put the nine to them
With the long clip, DeAndre Jordan
I cut off all my bitches, only thing on my mind is you
And whenever I'm hittin' it, I'm thinkin' 'bout spending my life with you
Swag, while I be pipin' you
Swear, I'm thinkin' 'bout wifin' you
I make lots of money, but I still make time for you
You're sweeter than honey, and these other bitches ain't fly as you
Swag, while I be pipin' you
Swag, I'm thinkin' 'bout wifin' you

You be my woman, my wife, I promise to love you for life
You got more juice than Sunny Delight
I'll be your plumber, give you pipe
See, she make me think I can sing, make me forget that I rap
She cook me breakfast on the stove, I slide my dick in from the back
I'm in love with this bitch
While she ride this dick, I be rubbin' her tits
Sometimes I can't help it, I think to myself
Man, this pussy so good, I might cum in this bitch
Say yes or say no, the decision is yours
Was gettin' lots of bitches, now mission abort
I cut bitches off like umbilical cords
Now come ride this dick cause it's yours
I'm ridin' with you to wherever God take us
The haters can't break us, girl let's stack this cake up
I feel on your booty while you do your makeup
I make time for you just like my name was Jacob
I don't ever worry cause I think you worthy
Like, James left the game, and I hung up my jersey
It's DBC gang, yeah that's why I talk dirty
And every time we bangin', you bust like my .30

I cut off all my bitches, only thing on my mind is you
And whenever I'm hittin' it, I'm thinkin' 'bout spending my life with you
Swag, while I be pipin' you
Swag, I'm thinkin' 'bout wifin' you
I make lots of money, but I still make time for you
You're sweeter than honey, and these other bitches ain't fly as you
Swag, while I be pipin' you
Swag, I'm thinkin' 'bout wifin' you

I used to have lots of hoes, shawty thought I was a pimp
See, she fell in love with my stroke, she ain't know that I could swim
She throw that ass back for a G, she know she fuck with a boss
I love when she cum on my D, hop up and she lick it all off
Got me gravitatin' with infatuation
Had to cut em' off, baby, amputation
Made that cancellation for a damn queen
Now my hands clean, baby, sanitation
Colder than winter, don't wanna lose her
She a winner, my favorite place is up in her
Slide in like a splinter, might treat that pussy like dinner
Legs in the air like antennas
Then climb up on top like a wrestler, she down for the count
Hold her leg up whenever I pin her
I cut like a dealer, my baby cum, I cum with her
Take care of that box, I deliver, she wet like a river
She drippin', we lit like a candle
I'm thumbin' the clit like I'm flickin' through channels
We switch positions, I spank her with no paddle
I came on her back like a camel, she shake and I rattle

I cut off all my bitches, only thing on my mind is you
And whenever I'm hittin' it, I'm thinkin' 'bout spending my life with you
Swag, while I be pipin' you
Swag, I'm thinkin' 'bout wifin' you
I make lots of money, but I still make time for you
You're sweeter than honey, and these other bitches ain't fly as you
Swag, while I be pipin' you
Swag, I'm thinkin' 'bout wifin' you

Nigga I ain’t nothing new to this, it’s FGE we do this shit
We be fly as a stewardess, but cross me like a crucifix
I’m back on that stupid shit, shootin’ shit believe that
Yo religion ain’t true as this
Pure common sense, boy that’s the thing that you lack
Just cause it’s published in a book, it doesn’t mean it’s a fact
Now listen, cause man we wasn’t allowed to read on them plantations
300 years, had my people growing impatient
Wanting to know what’s in that Bible and they can’t take it
Now let me tell you ‘bout the plan of a damn racist
Let’s teach these niggas love who hate ‘em so they can’t say shit
Whoever hits you, turn ya cheek, so they can’t face it
Edit the Bible before you show it to these L7’s
And this the shit that y’all buying? Now clientele sell it
Your mind, still, is a slave, that’s how they jail cell it
This is America people, I call it Hell’s Heaven

Aye, I know y’all mad at me
And probably call this blasphemy
But I know some Christians who tote pistols
That a blast for me
I know y’all mad at me
And probably call this blasphemy
But I know some Christians who tote pistols
That a blast for me

Mr 40 bang kicking niggas damn door
Up this bitch on everybody hit the damn floor
If you love your life you better let them bands go
I was out here tryna get it being broke I can't go
I ain't never lacking I stay with the damn pole
30 and this 40 I feel like I'm Rambo
They know I've got bodies they don't want no damn smoke
I used whip the Chevy sitting on them damn 4s
We strapped up in the club pistols on the dance floor
Now I'm 5k for a feature 10k for a damn show
Started from the bottom got it off the damn floor
Still gripping on my pistol I ain't never lettin' go
And I can ride with my baby
I'm just at the mall I'm getting fire with my baby yeah
And no bitch fine as my baby
Pussy soaking wet can't wait to slide in my baby yeah
Looked in the eyes of my baby
And told her that I love her I'd die for you baby yeah
Bonnie and Clyde with my baby (uh huh)
Shawty down to ride, committing crimes wit my baby (hey, whats up, hello)
I remember back in the day when I was bagging up country
I started trapping for money now I'm rapping for money
They say I snap and go dumby it's a wrap like a mummy
Ain't gotta mack to the honeys that comes naturally to me
And bitch I carry Glocks I done buried ops
So pussy come and get your cherry popped
Bet I wet a nigga like a fucking pool
When I catch a body like belly flop
I'm poled up with bronem
Count show money at the Marriott
Like fuck a deal I'm already hot
I ball out no Fetty Wap
Some might sit and wonder like "why he be on that savage shit"
But they don't know the half of it
Growing up not having shit
Momma off of crack and shit I'm at school being bad as shit
In front of the projects bumping backward flips on matresses
Grew older, weight on shoulders I start hustling and baggin' zips
Whole time I was trapping I was mastering this rapping shit
With hopes our sons would never have to hustle like their daddys did
That's why I'm so passionate
I used to imagine it
I'm so talented I got niggas who hate me blastin' it
Planet of the apes me and broskinem tote banana clips
My partners posing pictures with pistols call that a action flick
I told 'em fuck proving to them pussy niggas we packing shit
And taking pictures with theyself snitchin' bro that's that backwards shit
Start whackin' shit the rest'll start vanishing like a magic trick
Who better than me your hypothesis is inaccurate
So it don't really matter your favorite rapper's inadequate
Cause once I get to snappin' immaculate meets extravagant
I'm Maximus, Achilles and Spartacus mixed with Gannicus
Invested in myself just like vending machines with shades I'm stackin' chips
Go holla at KP 'fore I show ya broski my management
Big paper in pocket 'bout to fall out
So many fans can't even shop inside the mall now
Oh bitches see me on, oh they wanna call now
Shout out my haters who keep Tony dick in your mouth
You diss on me, me and my hitters up in your house
Caught a body, took the pistols to my dog house
Shawty riding for me I lay back she ride it for me
And understand that I'm the man and hella bitches tryna fuck me
Even though I am a killer she still love me bride of Chucky
And if she's poetic justice well I guess that I am lucky
She's my numero uno I don't know what you bitches think
She like me and just like me she don't smoke and she don't drink
She stay focused and her flow sound like a boat so we don't sink
Three hundred dollars worth of groceries got it all off of her link
Head fire, pussy good and you know that pussy pink
When I slide up in that pussy keep me warm just like a mink
Set that bitch up on the counter fucked her on the kitchen sink
And when I'm done she always bring me a wet towel and something to drink
And I'm like (ahh)
And she go hard for her nigga
See shawty held me down when times was hard for a nigga
Rent me cars, crack me cards bring it all to a nigga
If it's a foul yo she gon' take the charge for her nigga
And if I pass the pistol she gon' spark for her nigga
Up that iron and start sprayin' like stars for her nigga
Bring me back another broad then menage with her nigga
One sucking my dick one sucking the balls on a nigga
They eat me like a shark and turn to Jaws on a nigga
Let me cum all on their faces Santa Claus for a nigga
And when I'm on the road she help withdrawals for a nigga
Snapchat she make it clap I mean applause for a nigga yeah
Bitch I got bars like a prison
These other rappers weak you better toss 'em the spinach
And I promise they can't see me they Ray Charles to a nigga
And I'm all about my commas like a pause in a sentence
So make sure it's 'bout money when you calling a nigga
I'm a dog on a mission, flow's so raw and efficient
I go hard I'm consistent ain't no fraudulent business
Even haters talkin' shit was all a part of my vision
I told bro get on your shit so we can all make a killing
Risk it all 'fore I let my family starve in the trenches
No brakes I'm so driven I could cause a collision
If I kill you on sight, then I'm offing the witness
I'll be off in 60 seconds you get lost in a minute
So go ahead and dig a hole I'll put your coffin up in it
Niggas used to be my dogs now they all in they feelings
But it's FGE for life I'm taking off with the realest SQUAD!
Ratchets on deck passing pistols to my mans
Three killers with me with ski masks in the van
We gon' pull up like the ice cream truck
Straight out the window like the ice cream truck
Rolling down your block

Have them bodies drop
Them kids never had a chance
When I pull up like the ice cream truck

Bitch I think I'm Nino mixed with Al Pacino
Stacking chips like Pringles
I ball like Ochocinco
Ice man Dean Malenko
My wrist look like sprinkles
Iron in my pants like I'm getting out the wrinkles
Take a nigga out and I ain't talking 'bout a date
Cook a nigga like a steak and fix his niggas like a plate
Like a pepsi you get popped
Send your ass to heaven's gates
Got the police on your block
Decorate with yellow tape
(Go to church)
Okay fuckboy you softer than Nerf
I'm lurking all through your turf
When I pop at you I turn families blue
I'mma pop a nigga no smurf
These niggas clowns and Imma kill a clown so jokers don't post up
Been no joke, I don't smoke but Imma burn hard when I roll up
My mask on, my gloves on so I don't give a fuck who see me
That semi pop and start sending shots
I'll put you in a box like Houdini
Get smoked like loud packs when I pull up where your house at
Y'all bitch niggas, Y'all fugazi
My crew crazy we bounce back

Ratchets on deck passing pistols to my mans
Three killers with me with ski masks in the van
We gon' pull up like the ice cream truck
Straight out the window like the ice cream truck
Rolling down your block
Bout to pop like rubber bands
I bet bodies drop
Them kids never had a chance
When I pull up like the ice cream truck
Straight out the window like the ice cream truck
Look, big wings

Me and Tony two players like a split screen
I put my shooters on yo ass like some skinny jeans
And they goin' show up, poled up, shootin' anything
Cause they know a nigga breaded like some chicken wings
So for me they get it poppin' like it's in the grease
I have my youngins take your life and give it to me
I swear them niggas ain't right like 50 degrees
Zoro when I cut it leave her with the big Z's
And she gonna chew a nigga up cause i'm big league
You niggas small ball
All my niggas ball hogs
Shooters whack you with that iron like a golf ball
Put a hole in a nigga with the sawed off
Say he want beef but you niggas all talk
But we can still shoot about it like a false call
Body on the stretcher why he gettin' hauled off
And have his niggas all lost yelling aww nah
All y'all dogs should have been toting though
But I still feel like I gotta show them tho
I put the wings on a nigga like he OVO
Even though i'm at the top of the totem pole
I still take the shit wherever you wanna go
And then i take your bitch wherever she wanna go
Fly guys taking off, nigga

Niggas fake as fuck
That's why i choose to hug a pole
Had to bear up
Fill a hater up with shells like he layin' numb
Pockets healthy just like Gucci tryna keep it up
I can hit your bitch just gotta spend the day with her
Give her dick she sport it good, like i'm payin' her
Fresh as hell, be on point like Deadshot
Shawty let me slide in like the Red Box
Got a man ha, I want neck, headlock
Takin' bitches think I'm Future look who Scottie Pippen

No details how I did it
My bitch crazy and I'm crazy I'm Joker she Harley Quinn
I be all up in her water like tryna learn how to swim
Haters tryna block the shine like a nigga rockin' a brim

Got new bitches on my line had to cut 'em all like a pimp
And I got my money up like I'm taping it to the ceiling

Got dogs fighting in a cage, no Michael Vick
Harry Potter with that stick on a snitch
You know how we playin' if they sending shots in them 6
Then we keep spraying
Preacher talking 'bout turn a cheek, fuck what he sayin'
Kill him and it's justified sin, but we keep prayin'
In a world where majority sleep, horribly weak
And they slaughter when they order the sheet
God sharpening my sword and bitch i'm going for the cheek
Make sure I give 'em everything before I'm goin to sleep
Feel this who want a war with the son
I do this shit for my loved ones who don't know what's to come
Hardships, tribulations and they gon' know not to run
God first, load up some guns and store up some funds
When you shinin' watch the snake that's tryna soak up your sun

You don't need binoculars to see
Bad yellow bitch and she driving for me

Like D Wade, since day one been riding with the heat
Had to do what I did to survive in these streets
You already know if you don't grind you don't eat
Can't take no more L's, don't got no time for defeat
Ain’t get help from nobody, so I went and got it
I'm honest nothing was promised to me
Ain't no stoppin' my shine, to the top I'mma climb
Hope I make on time for my mama to see
My brain is bionic, atomic, I guess I can come and teach you about astrology
Fan say they love when I'm riding the beat
I'm good with the flow, I can mop, I can sweep
See niggas be hating then hop in a whip with a bitch and she got the Rap god on repeat
Cursed With A Blessing on Itune right now, If you buy it you feel like you copping a ki
Back in 08' I was copping them P's
Now I get paid just to hop on the beat
Someone tell DJ Drama to holla at me, I Jeffrey Dahmer a beat
Go talk to the Devil and ask him who is he
He'll tell you that he wish he was hotter than me
I'm armed in this bitch, Iverson rocking the sleeve
Goofys get popped when I squeeze
Although I'm cool as a tropical breeze, I will let this bitch blow like a thot on her knees
I feel for you niggas like I can not see
I shoot like Ray Allen when popping the three
Stop and pop up from the top of the key
Don't want problems with me, bitch I got what you need
I don't twitter beef, boy them choppers will speak
Come to your crib and then rock you to sleep
Body your ass then hop in the jeep, boy that 187 ain't mean nothing to me
Slide on them at night, they pajamas to me
Get popped in your noggin, your partners retreat
Every move I make them piranhas with me
I promise you don't want to collide with a beast
So fuck what you thought
We gonna outline these squares up in chalk like they playing hopscotch in the streets
When I come with them goons ain't no goblins with me
There ain't no way in hell you're surviving the heat
Broski know how it goes
We done been here before we gonna kick in the door and then pop them on three
I been popping niggas, my big poppa spitting
Bitch I got that Christopher Wallace with me
Just bought a mac to flip you niggas like a laptop
Get in my face watch me shoot it like a bad shot
This shit like Nicki, get your ass shot
You know I'm bodying that bitch like a mascot
Extended clips holding three O
Watch me shoot them like a free throw
My 40 singing like it's Ne-Yo
That's bullet holes in your whip, now you Cleo
You know I ball like a peep hole
Chain swinging like It's Debo
I make them piss like a PO
All their hair falling out, chemo
I'm taking over, bitch I'm taking over
I'm taking over, bitch I'm taking over
Do them like I did the last nigga
Shoot them through the glass nigga
Yeah, TO3
Yeah

Body after body all I know is murder, I'm from the darkside
If I have to draw, serve like volleyball, and drop it on y'all side
That's why I try hard to not get involved, and stay under God's lie
When I promise tomorrow just saw at their face, and pray for the lost eyes
Nigga's playing games with this shit
Why I'm hopin brains will get hit
I target minds, I ain't talkin' shells
But I really aim in this spit
What's your direction, nigga?
Do you know where you heading, nigga?
Hope it's to the cheddar, nigga
Then the heaven nigga, or whatever
But can't be around me if you don't want better, nigga
Yeah I know I'm ahead of nigga's
And I don't embellish, nigga
I try not to embarrass nigga's
But sometimes I can't help it, it's not in my character
It's just God's will that he carry with him
And you know that my berry with them
Case the hate get too real, it's okay, get buried with them
I will not Tom and Jerry with them
Cherry pick em, and drop every top that get hairy with him
I should thank God I ain't kickin' in doors no more
Emptying poles no more
50's on the road doe hoe
It ain't nothing to blow your show
But I'm in it to go get the cash
Give and get the love tryin' to reach the fans
Motivate they plans
Give em what I can
Give em to the man
Hopin' they advance
Cuz with no delay I'm going
I'm growing, I'm glowin'
If it's war bitch, then I'm blowin'
No rims nigga, I'm scorin'
My wings up bitch, I'm soarin'

And I lift em up, middle fingers up
To the PPD, 309 pistol county where I'm from
Sip a lotta lean
Roll a lotta gas, do a lotta drugs
If I want ya boys bands, I hit him up
It'll be 2k, that'll split him up
Call my nigga Real
I'mma get the back, you go get the front
Bandannas like Montana's over my face when I hit em up
Roll on em like Alabama
Once I up seven better give it up
Like a 6-4
Drop his top then put em in the trunk
Better get low
Fore the fifth blow
Blowin big dro
36 O's
Shout out big moe
That my big bro
Momma told me how these nigga's switch though
Keep a big a pole
With extendos
Like a joystick
On Nintendos
Like I'm workin in the drive through
Give it to em right through the window
Chopper spray
Bodies drop
Niggas ride away
Where I'm from its the slums, nigga
Get theyself fucked up a lotta ways
I ain't saying that you gotta pray
But I seen it coming like a mile away
I'm just saying what I got to say
Prolly not today
But every motherfucker got a day

Yeah, y'all know how I'm rockin, bitch
J-Real, uh, 15

Picture me rollin like 2Pac
Out the window blowin two Glocks
Pullin up like tube socks
With more ratchets than a toolbox
Ain't a rapper, bitch I'm a shooter
Your bitch, she gonna suck like a loser
Slug me up like looter's
Then it's back gettin that mulah, yeah
Tip toe to that cash
Till that front door
Then it's kick door
While I grip pole for that cash
Hell no I don't need no mask
Nigga's hoes, they already know
They don't want me up foldin em on that ass
In that 4-door with the 4-0
Hop out blowin' at they ass
Acting like I never had shit
Cuz I never, ever, had shit
And after every show I got a bad bitch
Touching on me like a tablet
Yeah, that bitch she on me
She just prolly wanna meet Tony
But you know the rules
Gotta meet broski
Then broski and broski
Yeah

You know you gotta do broski 'nem
It's No Fatigue
Y'all can remember this, too

Blowin' powerpuff with these bitches nice
Sugar with the spice
I'mma get em right
Coming from the bottom like some fucking ice
See the green clear like a fuckin' Sprite
When I hit the booth it don't be nothin' nice
And bitches want the D, I got a couple hypes
They gonna let me hit like a bunch of likes
When she throw it back like a bunch of hikes
Tell bud he better be wiser before he get hit in his six pack
Right out the can, yeah, sip that
That'll make a pussy nigga sit back
He can get the forty like he bet a dub
He can get the forty like he bet on one
I bet I be hotter if he bet the sun
Had to branch off from the separate ones
See that boy runnin' like a street sign?
We gon' give that pussy boy a peace sign
All these bitches want me like iPhones
Tell her slide on me, I need iHome
In your ho's-tel, no room b
Still slidin', no room key
Your bitch suck like they boo-ing
Nigga's mad at me like oooo-weee
Young boy cool like the 3-Cs
Met a pretty girl with the 3-Bs
Spray in his house like fa-breeze
Mask on, nigga can't see me
I don't rock with niggas cuz they offbeat
I be talkin' money, nigga's talk cheap
I be in her mouth like false teeth
Then I'm in between like flossing
Roll up smoking with these Bs
I hit that bitch in the eve
She shake it like tambourine
I just had to hit and run
Hope she don't say please when I leave
I ball, I pull up like a sleeve
Her pussy pink like that lean
Touchin' my chest cuz I'm king
She wanna search just like Bing
Now that bitch got what she need
Ballin', but not in the league
'Tigue

Rap God, FGE shit
You already know how we comin', man
Bases loaded in this bitch
Uhuuuhh

Fire in the church
There's liars in the church
Scratch the surface, find a diamond in the dirt
You gotta grind until it hurts
I am triumphed and diversed
Flow rare, unfair, might start a riot with this verse
I will father like Mufasa 'til I'm lyin' in the hearse
Drive your lioners berzerk
I see clients in my merch
Ok, I'm breaded bitch
You know I'm breaded like mozzarella sticks
Godly, how is he heaven sent but so devilish?
The coldest flow, colder than any Eskimos ever been
Was sellin' shit
I served for 8 years, I felt like the president
Been nailin' shit
You'll get off tonight like you workin' second shift
Wings up, all praise to the merciful and beneficent
I second guess the message
The truth ain't never pleasant
The future's present hip-hop's alive and resurrected
Play with me and I'm airin' opps
It get's uglier than Carrot Top
Leave her pussy bloody like it's cherry popped
Six feet deep, three pair of socks
Put em in the ground, that's deep rooted
We keep winnin', y'all keep losin'
We don't twitter beef, bitch we shootin'
All kinda clips, come preview it
This clip in my ak got 50 in it, that's G-Unit
Got another clip with a hundred rounds
That got mo' in it, that's 3 Stooges
Plus 30 in my Dez Eagle
Turn em into red people
Whack em while their jewelry on
Nigga, icy dead people
Glock sing when the mops ring
Lay em down first like a box spring
Had to sauce on em like some hot wings
We be goin in like a swat team
Squah!
Rap god, man, FGE shit, man. You already know what it is man
You already know why I'm here, man
I ain't like this fucking beat. Only doing this shit cause my fans asked me
In the studio, eating Halls and shit. Still sick with this shit

These haters on my dick piss em off
Take a pic with his bitch flick him off
These rappers trying to steal my swag get the sauce
They sold they soul for a loan niggas lost
I was lit like a new torch,streets was my new sport
Belt buckle double g's like two forks
Was drug dealing freakin balling like I'm Too $hort
Was serving niggas in the mall like a food court
Deuce 5 on me I was Derrick Rose in New York
Had to put some squares in a box like some Newport's
I grew older and my heart got colder
And my mind got stronger
And my money got longer
And them bitches got naked,and them people started hatin'
And my guns got bigger,so my flow got sicker
Let me tell you about this young cat,I always used to front packs
Was known for poking niggas for that paper like a thumbtack
I told them come rap, stop hangin with them dumb cats
It's free J Real until the day my nigga comeback
I used to pull up on the block with the bass banging
Big Strap hug a nigga like he waist training
I catch you clowns running around get your face painted
I put the chrome to his dome cause I hate aiming
10K for a show, you better hurry before the price change up
Rap god the light bringer,The life changer
I hope they pull it, 30 bullets in my banger
Versace shoes on looking like the white ranger
And these bitches not my problem they ain't stressing me
Bitch if you not my you bitch you can't question me
And shawty wanna blow my whistle she be beggin me
You call her Stephanie?, I call her referee
Shawty got that fire head that's a specialty
Head down between my legs OOOUUU pedigree
KP just called said he got another check for me
Like why you keep on sonning them I should get a vasectomy
Flow heavenly G.O.D. keep on blessing me
On my legacy
Saucing they want the recipe
I'm flyer then a Frisbee got all the bitches fetching me
And your bitch like my song she know every word like a spelling bee
Boy I swear we will be nothing breathing ahead of me
Came a long way from selling weed, wetting shit like the 7 seas
Stacking dough,and cracking hoes filling niggas with jealousy
Way before the felony's had these bitch niggas scared of me
I promise if you threaten me, When I see you you better be ready to back it up because I'm on your heels like i'm Beverly
Killing the infidelity,After U like the letter V
Gun smoking so much I think God might just be inhaling me
My swagger said,Might bag ya bitch
Go through walls like casper shit
Might sent her back after I hit,Then go home to the baddest bitch
Thats savage shit,I spaz and shit
Rap god to some I'm blasphemous
I've mastered this,They mad as shit
They can't stand me like Kapernick
I've passed the grace,Steve Nash assist
My wrist matches Michael Jackson's kicks
That 40 in my lap and shit,No poking me like cactus's
And no more moving packages
I'm stacking chips,my cash is thick
They broke as hell but paying tithes
Reason there pastor is rich
Pole inside my jumpsuit look like I be running track and shit
This 30 be my magic stick
I shoot like I'm T Mack with it
Catch an opp in traffic like Lebron you know I'm glassin' shit Don't joke and play,Just hope and pray one day I don't go back to this
Trunk fly in the front on some Dumbo shit
Bitch I'm flying until I die on my Nutso shit
Now run and tell all your friends how I went nuts on this
I'm cutthroat bitch,I promise I don't trust no bitch
And I ain't even gotta meet her I can fuck your bitch
Balling like Krillin bet I cut like a destructo disc
You play with mines I'm on your ass fuck all that humble shit
The greatest pussy never seen a killer come so quick
Clip out the window hanging longer then Rapunzel shit
It go BRAAAAAAATTT until my gun go click
Pussy's always in there feelings about something I said
Yelling "Gang, Gang, Gang" until one of them dead
You gotta brain better use it or get one in the head
I got killers like porn stars there gonna come for the bread
But I'm so independent with it I'm coming with it instead
I'll pop you up until you drop like you was jumping in bed
Go wash my hands after I leave the scene covered in red
Then kiss my momma on the head and tuck my sons into bed
Caught em lackin' up in traffic and got clean on em
Ease on em, let my trigger finger squeeze on em
Put that pressure on the nigga like it's weed on em
Smoked his ass,Hit the gas(VROOM), Speed on em

Demons dressed as friends better watch them they envious
Don't Doubt The God album dropping May 20th
These haters on my dick piss, em off
They never..Whatchu' thought
FGE got it on lock, man of course
Hater's on my dick,piss em off
I remember coming home back from the store
To my Momma smoking crack on the stove
Back then we was lackin’ the dough
Never would’ve thought one day I’d be baggin’ up O’s
Pack in a pole, standing on the Ave with the folks
Feeling like Shaq in the post
Now a nigga rappin’ at shows, gettin’ cash for the flow like turn up swag on ‘em hoes
(Then I gotta thank god)
Thank god we ain’t broke no mo’, ain’t gotta kick doors no mo’
Ain’t gotta sell dope no mo’, ain’t it funny all of sudden all the hoes gon go
Momma told me boy spit that pain, bet the whole world gon’ chant yo name
Nigga I’m blessed I can’t complain, I’m one of one I can’t come plain
No days off man niggas ain’t train like this, street nigga with aim like this
Feeling like Mike in a game like this, got me thinking I could really make change like this
If I slang like this and I hang like this wit my chain like this bunch of rings like this
Pull up on a nigga in a range like swish, switchin’ hands on ‘em when I drive the lane like this
But it ain’t like that, that’s the reason why I came like that
Everywhere I go I bring my strap, cause these opps tryna block
When they see you headed to the top and I let the 40 bang like that
Watch his brain go splat, keep it movin’ if you ain’t on that
Once I do it boy I can’t go back, I been at niggas heads like a kangol hat
Got more fire than a lighter boy you ain’t no match
You don’t know my struggle, you don’t my grind, you don’t know the thoughts going thru a nigga mind
You don’t know my past, you don’t my path, you don’t my wrath, nah pussy nigga you don’t know the half
You don’t know my cash, you don’t know my math, you don’t know the racks that a nigga done had
You don’t know about the ungrateful muthafuckas talking down when a nigga got down to his last
Real nigga bounce back, you don’t know my stash
You don’t know the snakes, you don’t even mow the grass
You don’t know the good, you don’t know the bad
You don’t know the goodtime, you don’t know the sad
You don’t know the real, you don’t know the will, you don’t know ill, my nigga you don’t know the feel
You don’t know the deal, you don’t know the drill when we in the field all my niggas know when to kill
You gotta go hard man I promise it ain’t no love in these streets boy
Once had hoop dreams but then got turned in to a D-boy
Risking my freedom so the ones I love can eat boy
This world is cold it’s only right I keep that heat on
Nigga I don’t trust shit, fuck yo assumptions, I ain’t got time for the fuck shit
Boy I from the city where they grind, liftin’ nine, niggas dyin’ in the mind, and the blind is corrupted
We bringing that toast, since a yougin’ I was told shit happen
Gotta be on point like a cactus, momma kept the blade in the mattress
Daddy kept a gun in the dresser, wish a nigga would come test us
My nigga I done live the frontline, and I takeover when it’s clutch time
Why you waitin’ on a punchline, I hope you ready when it’s duck time
Cuz I’m liftin’ two 45’s like I pump iron
Runway down the one way admiration for the gun play
I hope I don’t catch another gun case
And it seem like the people that you do the most for be the ones fake
And Shawty told you that she love you, always be there for you, claim she’ll do anything for you
Soon as a nigga go to jail and get time you gon find she was lying man these bitches ain’t loyal
We all fall for the devil’s tricks, nailing chicks that be hella thick
I’m selling shit to get hella chips, addiction got us hella sick
Only God is the medicine all the other shit is irrelevant
We got eat in this world full of greed everybody want a big bite
I swear to God in this life ain’t shit right
I got niggas up in jail talented as hell but can’t get right
I from the bottom came from nada but I promise you gon see us take flight like a big kite
I’m still a nigga that yo bitch like, shit tight, wrist bright, try me both hands on the 12 like midnight
And you don’t want to feel a gauge nigga
You don’t want to hear pump sound
You don’t want to feel the rage nigga
Didn’t I tell you I don’t fuck around, I put an end to your age nigga
You don’t want to meet your gravedigger, I don’t give fuck about a cage nigga
I know the pain like a slave nigga to me it’s just another day nigga
I never fail to amaze but I’m stuck up in my ways nigga
Swaggin' like Allen

Pussy ass niggas could never be down

Give death to these actors, Heath Ledger a clown

Smiling looking sinister
Pull up in somethin' tinted up
Body you and then I lay low like Forest Whitaker
Then go up lift my brothers and sisters like I'm the minister
I ain't perfect with my kids if I ain't working
I encourage higher learning I'm teaching through fire verses
Till the day we lie in hearses
I'm fighting the lying serpent
Ride and lurking
Hit you pussies make sure you don't die a virgin
Johnny Torture
Tire burning
I'm fancy like writing cursive
Rap God I'm way to real to have someone come write my verses
Dangerous
You know this ain't a game to us

Flew from a falling nest
If I feel y'all a threat

You don' f'd up all black we dressed up
Put a clip up to his head give that boy a fresh cut
Driving dirty with no Ls i was living reckless
Swerving serving pounds just to get my check up
Had 20 on my wrist 20 on my necklace
Balled every time you see me just like Uncle Fester

After I find out where you livin' Ima go inside
Its goin' down, slide over with the .45
Click Clack wet his ass like a water slide
Or I might run up like a bum on em (BANG)
Police interrogate I'm goin' dumb on em
My nigga you don't want the gun play
My gun spray I off a nigga like the bug spray
Beats get brutally murdered whenever I be on it
Flow so cold Wayne Gretzky could come play hockey on it
Sold the nina thing for 250 and had a body on it
And theres plenty more where that come from if anybody want it
I tell my nigga throw the SUV in reverse
I'm bout to put these pussy niggas on a t-shirt
So pray to god when I up it you don't be first
Before he judge yo ass you gotta see me first
That nigga shoulda had a vest on him
These niggas squares baby I'm just playin' chess on em
Bitches on D like a full court press on em
Headrest ready shawty wanna put the neck on him
Growin' up i never had shit
Well motherfucka' that was past tense
Now i got it that's why i be talkin' cash shit
She only cheat on him with me now that's a bad bitch
Like if God had wrote the bible
This is straight from the mouth of the person who made these verses
Can't change the words on this album
I'm loading my gun while reading 48 Laws of Power
The rapper that taught you how to acknowledge the higher power
Not eating bullshit they feed us, I duck it like Robert Townsend
I'm the son that he's proud of, that's linking you like a browser
They beat you therefore you cower
Slave owners is who you bow to
I'm on a whole 'nother level, Vegeta gon' need a scouter
I am the hottest outchea
Don't need no label to vouch, yeah
I'm wilder than Rottweiler
That's high off the gun powder
Came from the dirt like a flower, fuck nigga don't ever doubt us
My regulators 'gon mount up and wet you up like a shower
Fly high as the Lord allow us
While keeping fuck shit from 'round us
The flyest killas you know like them pilots the twin towers
I'm getting gwola, I'm getting hotter, my future's blazing
The lava flowin, I got it going, I'm too impatient
I'm cold as hell like I'm cool with Satan, I'm too amazing
I've been in my glo like a super saiyan, you used to hating
Forever hustling, might catch me in heaven selling spirits
If you saw my bitch, you swear there's an angel in heaven missing
Bars so hot you would think I sat in the devil's prison
They say Jesus coming, I'm starting to think he'll never visit
If you are listening, you are witnessing exorcism
The best description is: heaven sent him, he's blessed for rhythm
Father to my sons I can never be no deadbeat
And still saluting pops because I never forget who fed me
Pain is what prepared me, struggle ain't never scared me
Beef with anybody, I love my nigga; you dead meat
And I don't mean to brag, but pardon me like the red sea
And I ain't grocery shopping but I'll be where the bread be
I got this rap shit on lock, that's why they dread me
Ask Satan who he fear most of all and that nigga said me
Bitch I'm so mothafucking cold I can summon souls
And I can make the summer cold flow go dumb as Cole
I get more money on the road, then the fucking toll
Like strippers catch me with that dough and the fucking pole
Sliding on them like debit, I'm trained to shoot like I'm Riddick
I lay you down like some edges, and show you pussies what wet is
I studied you, did my research, learned how you work like a medic
Come out the cut with that chopper, I take shit out when I edit
I'll shoot your ass like a movie, and then I roll like the credits
I put in work on my own, bitch my middle name calisthenics
I remember when I was starving, remember when I was broke
Remember hating that feeling, didn't wanna feel it no more
I remember bagging up dope and selling it like a Bo
When worried 'bout getting poked, had nina under my coat
Remember when y'all was sleeping, remember when I was woke
I was up perfecting my flow, now I'm getting bread by the loaf
The same ones that used to divide us, edit bibles to blind us
Beat us killed and deprived us, and we gon' let 'em guide us?
The best disguise is a book, you know they demise us
You wanna rise up nigga, you better wise up
You think for God like he's hiding but he's inside us
Wakes us up everyday but you still ain't opened your eyes up
I can provide the truth for you, even provide the proof for you
Stupid folks ain't gon' get it, you stick would who tied the noose for us
The same ones who tied the knot and put that rope up
Been telling lies to get the common people's hopes up
And everything that they printed, you chose to soak up
The jokes up, they ain't fear us until we woke up
My 40 on me plus God with me, I ain't alone
Yes I'm that nigga they hated on, heart made of stone
They came a long way taking losses but staying strong
Said I wouldn't make it but they was wrong, my paper long
Picasso, any canvas I ever painted on
They play my songs and debate upon my greatest poems
Now that the kids can sing along, I'm breaking bones
They faith is gone, they wish they was on like Game Of Thrones
Can't chill with fake men, I'd rather spend all of my days alone
I seen more snakes than Medusa
Therefore my face is stoned
And you know God is not the author of confusion
Do you really rock with God or were you bribed with an illusion?
Hoping at them pearly gates, he'll pick you up when he's choosing
And your chances isn't ruined by the sinning you've been doing
As soon as that karma set in
Forgive me father I'm begging
I'm thankful for all my blessings and instantly start confessing
You need to be taught a lesson
See I was charged with possession
I mentally store artillery, every thought is a weapon
I'm prepping for Armageddon, curing the narcoleptic
I'm just giving my gift, so I wrap my past with my present
I'm spitting bars with a message, not here to spar with you Reverend
I ain't going against God, cause I came across him with questions
Yeah, I can make you pause for a second, hell
I don't wanna go if my loved ones ain't all in heaven
God
FGE shit
Fire in the Church
And all that
May 20th
This why they call me the fuckin' rap god, man

Tony Mon-tana
And bro nem got blown with the blamma
I freed all the guys out the slamma
I came with that bag like I'm Santa
Two straps on my hip like a Pamper
Try to check us, get popped like a Fanta
I will slide with that pole like a dancer
Come up outta that tent like a camper
Dressed up in all black like a panther
I creep and I crawl, no tarantula
Bandana my face in a flag
Choppa singin' the national anthem
I'm shootin' shit, Canon
The clip's in a shape like banana
He got nailed he wasn't watching his grammar
Bitch I think I'm Thor with the hammer
A.I. what I nicknamed my gun
And yo' question, I stay with the answer
In the field, I will leave yo' ass lyin'
In a hole, you get buried like Sanders
Oh, I could black both of your eyes
Leave your bitch ass lookin' like a panda
I get green like the hulk, no Atlanta
Right after they check out my lines like a scanner
Got your bitch on my dick, I can't stand her
Hit, now she think she all that like Amanda
Yeah, you know I ball like Evander
And she call me daddy like I'm Danny Tanner
The pussy pink like she fight cancer
I let that bitch give me top on the camera
Went down south from me like Alabama
I came and I made that bitch step like the gamma

It's too fuckin' easy!
Get off me!
I'm just getting warmed up in this mothafucka'
Wooh!
Wooh!
Wooh!
Wooh!

Turned off her phone to make you think that her phone dead
She grabbed my Gucci belt buckle, I told her "Go ahead"
She ate my dick and nicknamed it Dick Daddy Long Legs
She gave me dome so long, I called her ConeHead
You a send-off
You be taking orders, Good Burger nigga
Old broke ass, pockets hurtin', nigga
Is you fat or skinny Buddy Sherman nigga
I discourage niggas, then dirt a nigga
Klay Thompson got the Stephen Curry with 'em
That's a warrior we got with a 30 with 'em
Boy this ain't a game, I ain't Derwin, nigga
Get in rappers' head like a turban, nigga
Make 'em feel the heat like a furnace, nigga
If I wave it at 'em like a current, nigga
Then he catchin' bullets, Michael Irvin, nigga
With his magazine from this ratchet sing
Ain't no calories, I'll burn a nigga
Put yo' greasy ass in a fuckin' box
That's churches, nigga, I done murdered niggas
If I'm lyin', then God can come strike me down
When I come up they gon' invite me out
Stay online talkin' shit 'till i sign 'em out
Had to check 'em, I took 'em to Nike town
And these bitches, they wanna be wifey now
I just did nine shows, that's ninety thou(sand)
I be drippin', I know they don't like me now
Somebody please come and wipe me down
I'm on the edge, no baseline
With a hoodie on like Trayvon
I'll shorten up your lifespan, I don't waste time to come take time
Black 40 singin', thats Akon
I'm a real shoota, fuck James Bond
No screenshot, my gun flash, all headshots, that's FaceTime
Back to the green, like Draymond
Whoo!
But see me, I don't play no fuckin' games
You a goofy, a Buford, a fuckin' lame
You wanna ride on my dick for some fuckin' fame
Get sent out from your block, that's a fuckin' shame
Even you know you not in my fuckin' lane
I pulled up on you niggas like Birdman
And you know not to play with my fuckin' name
I know God gon' be real disappointed in me
If I choose to come blow out ya fuckin' brains
Do yo' pussy ass like I did What's-His-Name
Take his ass out the fuckin' game
You a toy boy you ain't got Buzz
You ain't hard, nigga you a fake Woody
Cook his soft ass like some baked cookies
Zip his body up like a Bape hoodie
My lyrics dope, I got crack for the fiends
He thought he could see me, he imagining things
He ain't enough cash to come clash with the king
While you boys was sleepin', I mastered yo' dreams
I'm swaggin', I'm saucin', with fashion I'm clean
I come through with some shit that you haven't seen
You gotta be sick, all you do is ride dicks
Someone go get this pussy some vaginal cream
They call me Girbauds, got that strap in my jeans
I'm Abdul Jabbar, cause I'm after Kareem
If he crosses the line, then my bullets flyin'
I'll give him a 50 like he Zach Lavine
Boy, you just a actor that rap like Hakeem
Don't make me come down like the wrestler Sting
Take L's like a knight when I slide like a bishop
I'll checkmate your king then snatch up your queen
I'm bout to blow like they passed me the green
Just got a new gat, it's a mac with a beam
My gauge is Fantasia, whenever I sing
Get wet with this pump when I squeeze gasoline
See, when it come down to them bars
Bitch I got a whole buncha' lotta' shit
You can pay for this knowledge with scholarships
Rap god givin' hip hop it's oxygen
They find it astonishing
Every line, he's been prime like he Optimus
Shine like he polished himself
Had to grind to the top and shit
He's been blessed, he's the best
He's like Jordan in '96
FGE who we rockin' with
Record labels mad cause he ain't signin' shit
I thank God that I don't owe nobody shit
Flow with an old soul like a moccasin
Go tell 'Ye that I'm killin Desiigner's shit
I just bear hugged a panda then bodied it
You irrelevant, you talk a lotta shit
You should write a book called "How to Ride a Dick"
Man he fresh, I be on some Big Tymer shit
Bitches hope I slide in with my hockey stick
My 40 got 30 inside of it
It got Mr. Miyagi's karate kick
I'll blast off, shoot you up like a rocket ship
Bullets bust in yo' face like you poppin' zits
With them guns he be clumsy, he droppin' shit
Zip you up like a onesie, I'm poppin' shit

Montana, I'm the Rap God
Every bar's cold, every line hot
Fire in the Church, sorry for the wait
Had to put the panda in a pine box
Squad!

From the the PC so shout out to my jets
2820 south cal you met
Straight off the low end
And when I start flowing you know Ima go in like nothing but net
Was up in the trap like i was caught in a net
Waiting on the 1st of the month for them checks
My mom was a victim
Cocaine in her system sometimes It felt like my OG was possessed
Young nigga stressed
Bad up in school acting a fool report card full of F's
As I grew older I got a little wiser
Opened my eyes and realized that I'm blessed
Check out my chest
Bitch I'm the best
Put so much work in I ain't gotta flex
Put me on a track and I bet I catch wreck
Just bring bread and that beat ima put it to rest

Ever heard of a devil in a dress

With niggas who hustle moving weight like a sumo
Swag on the honeys they loving it
They all on my dick they want some of it
Id rather get money then fuck a bitch
But ima get money then fuck a bitch
Might fuck someone chick for the fuck of it
Her mouth on my pipe like a cluck and shit
All that was yo bitch I didn't even notice it
Man that ho know she can suck a dick
Everytime I hit the block
I keep a Glock in the car for the opps
No Ls but I'm whipping while I'm getting top
Im ballin I'm tatted up feeling like I'm PAC
Picture me Rollin while she blowing cock
She decent eating that D like a Brot
You'll think that I'm Italian the way I be styling
Now I'm finna crank it up just a notch
Straight out Chicago hip hop Picasso
Lyrically sick bitch I kick it like taboo
When I step out look like I hit the lotto
Gucci, Louie , Ralph Lauren Ferragamo
Later that night I slide dick in a model
Pussy so wet man that nigga need goggles
Sometimes I feel like a Soprano
How I be strapped I feel like desperado
Long 30 clip and it's filled up with hollows
Talking that shit and it's clapping like bravo
Got you ducking like you daffy and Donald
Body yo ass then get to my dough
Bitch I ain't rocko but I'm all about my nachos

Call that shit cinco de mayo
Bitch I'm a mob boss
Def Starz

All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to get my family out the hood
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to see you smile and know you're good
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to get my homies out the hood
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to see her smile and know she good

All I ever wanted was to make a fucking difference
Knew a lot that never did it
Tryna be the one who did it
Grew up in the project building
Witnessed dealings and some killings
Devil grinning with how we living
Niggas sinning just to get it
Used to go to bed at night while watching roaches on the ceiling
Taking turns with plates and fork
Because there wasn't enough dishes
Taught to share with all my siblings, If I got it they can get it
I remember watching my OG get high up in the kitchen
I remember finding pipes she hid up in the oven mitten
How I used to throw them out
The ninth floor window like I'm pitching
Then act like I never did it
Thinking that would make her quit it
I still pray to God for healing
If you're real I know you hear me (Ahhhh)

All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to get my family out the hood
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to see you smile and know you're good
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to get my homies out the hood
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to see her smile and know she good

All I ever wanted was to make it to the top
Used to look up to my Pops, and all he played was Big and Pac
I figured if I rapped like them well maybe i could get this guap
Put me on TV, I can't see me in no can or in no box
Never thought I had to hussle, never thought I'd tote these Glocks
Never thought I fight them cases, sleeping counties on a cot
Niggas think shit funny til this 40 gets to singing, Jamie Foxx
You beef with me then bodies drop
Boy you dont want to be my opps
And I dont leave no witnesses so can't nobody can tell the cops
Niggas snitching, choppers take them out the picture when I crop
Never planned on popping pussies or nobody getting shot
But I ain't never complain about mine, Nigga you know how I rock

All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to get my family out the hood
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to see you smile and know you're good
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to get my homies out the hood
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to see her smile and know she good

All I ever wanted, was to give my people hope
And get their backs up off the ropes
Make my people proud, keep your heads above the clouds
Bought my momma a big ol' house, I just wanna see you smile

All I ever wanted was my OG off of drugs
Used to wash clothes in the tub, Never thought I'd be the plug
All I ever wanted was to make it with this rapping
First I'll trap and get to stacking and invest and make it happen
All I ever wanted to see my niggas shine
Never thought that you would be jealous
You was hating all the time
Had that fuck shit on your mind, don't know how you was designed
But the Lord didn't make me blind, I know how to read them signs

All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to get my family out the hood
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to see you smile and know you're good
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to get my homies out the hood
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to see her smile and know she good

I do this for the ones from the bottom that never had a chance
Straight off the porch from the slaughterhouse to the savage land
Make niggas lean if they intervene with Montana’s plans
With this big old strap round my neck I shoot like the camera man
Go call them people, I’m bodying them, no ambulance
I rolled down on em, way colder than any avalanche
This MC keep the tooly, but I don’t hammer dance
The body bags on these niggas look like some hammer pants
Man I remember them nights when my mom was getting high
She locked herself in the bathroom while a young nigga cried
At times felt helpless, didn’t give a fuck if I live or die
Some heavy praying to god and now I’m back energized
You motherfuckers don’t know the pain that I feel inside
I drop to my knees every day and thank god I’m still alive
Was ill advised, getting fly when I shouldn’t have spent a dime
Been blamed for murders, caught cases, yeah I’ve been criticized
Hunger, passion, rage, when I rap they say I’m uncivilized
I was facing nine the lord saved me right in the nick of time
Montana the truth, you just proof that the devil been a lie
Dealt with all my struggles and troubles that made a nigga wise
I’m gon make sure that my family eat when it’s dinner time
First nigga cross me, it’s over for him like finish lines
I put that clip to their back and I won’t get penalized
I put that on life, Imma turn these niggas to nigga pies
Yeah, I got these rappers on my dinner plate
You April fools don’t see the enemy
I penetrate and make these pussys hyperventilate
I ain’t got no beef cause I done murdered all my enemies
Innovate when I illustrate, straight up out the illest state
I’m the reason you niggas hate
Been schooling you niggas, too weak for me just like winter break
I been this great, this nigga made, I got more juice than minute maid
I ain’t always been this way, there’s reasons why I renegade
I make an example out you nigga, don’t make me demonstrate
Tell Satan that I’m murdering any goofy he send this way
Glock pop at your top before I let an opp get rid of me
Don’t make me do my homework, find out where that nigga stay
Cause Imma light him up the same night like Independence Day
Understand you’re playing with fire nigga
These other rappers look at me like barbed wires nigga
Got that Smith and Wesson and plus an extra clip up in my jeans
We gon make it home safe cause I got hitters on my team
I done seen some of the coldest niggas give up on their dreams
Lost they vision for the green, I seen niggas turn to fiends
I ain’t tripping, no submission, I ain’t quitting, Andrew Wiggins
I’m on mission, Russell Simmons, I go get it for my team
Put a bad bitch up in traffic, now she whipping for a king
Puppet master for the cash, I got these bitches on a string
And I ball hard till I’m fouling out, that’s why I be styling out
Cause other than my kids, shit I ain’t got too much to smile bout
Cut out all that wolfing, give a fuck bout what you howling bout
Cause I’m ready to bang like a judge pulling his gavel out
Bitch I'm made, self employed, real McCoy, toting toys
With no FOID, I destroy, I’m too poised for these boys
They annoyed by my noise, fighting, tryna raise my boys
Bitch I’m Molly, Roy, Jones
Mike Tyson mixed with Floyd
And greedy people hang around you when you promise them blessings
Would you still be loyal to god if he didn’t promise you heaven?
How would you live after you sin and God wasn’t forgiving
You say since I’m going to hell, I might as well keep on sinning
Blood sucking motherfuckers, they judging, I’m glad I ain’t you
I can’t be bought with bribes, I’m loyal because I’m thankful
I spit what’s painful, cause nigga I’m not ashamed to
Frequent conversations with the one you always pray to
Asking for forgiveness, I been whacking shit like Babe Ruth
Bitch I keep that thing glued, my lyrics is brain food
Your bitch on my dick, boy I’m the one she give that brain to
And that pussy’s so wet that I should fuck her wearing rain boots
So if you heard about a nigga super sick with the flow
Don’t beat on women but that nigga steady hitting your ho
Both of his wrists is icy, look like he been digging in snow
Run with a clique of dirty boys, on the mission for dough
Murder whenever he feel like it’s time for niggas to go
Hey that’s Montana, AKA the flyest killer you know
God
I feel like it's my, it's my uh, my responsibility to do that and to give you something good, you know. Whether they know it or not, you basically... you're a teacher. You got somebody's attention. And, you actually givin' them something. I'm finna give it to you. Every kind of way, you know, the good and the bad

Fire in my eyes, like when the stove blaze
I am the revenant, I done been through those cold days
Fighting demons, trying not to turn to my old ways
Like you lackin' traffic, I'm blasting ratchets, that's road rage
Ya'll using structures, you niggas ain't using logic
One shot in-between ya eyes, and you closing em like a closet
The afterlife isn't promised, only death, we can't dodge it
This life we live ain't forever, so make the most while you got it
Don't fry your brain with narcotics, see God is my only chronic
Your demons might bring you down, but he'll bring you up like hydraulics
I'm full of wisdom and knowledge, and sharin' it like a prophet
So love me all for my actions, not cuz of what's in my pockets
Just counted a thousand hunnids, my momma proud of her son
And she smilin' cuz now I'm buzzin'
Knew I would amount to something
She told me "all smiles ain't smiles, all grins ain't grins
Watch every nigga around you, all friends ain't friends
Don't be no fool, stay on your shit
All love ain't love, my son, all snakes don't hiss"
I got so much knowledge bottled up
Check up on me, no follow-ups
Teachin' all of my follower's
Till' they nail me like Yeshua
Look, don't sell your soul
Real nigga's don't ever fold
Just set and pursue your goals
The truth that was never told
Is they'll bribe you with cars and clothes
Shiny diamonds and gold
Performin' at hella shows
And after that, nailin' hoes
I've been grinding on my own
They can't bribe me with no loans
Before I live as a slave, I'll be dying on my throne
Don't do lying in my songs
Bitch, I'm flyer than the drones
Taking giants out they zones
Tell Goliath "bring it on!"
Rich thoughts while I'm living broke
Was sweeping, stumping, killing roaches on that kitchen floor
Sent to get eggs, but was stealing while was in the store
Went many winters with hoodies, didn't have no winter coat
Fuck that, start dealing dope
Got paper like an envelope
Was fuckin' paid, no gigolo
I swear I was so fresh that even Zest thought I invented soap
I ran into the fucking cops, fell off, had to kick a door
Lost lots of green like pigalo
I'm just thankful I'm still afloat
Remindin' God that I'm thankful, I always tell him that
While hoping the people we've lost is wherever heaven's at
And I know what that struggle like, robbin', stealin', sellin' packs
When this christmas come, your kids don't wonder where they presents at
The bar's been set, go be better than those that came before you
Flex like bodybuilders, and shine on nigga's like baby oil
But try not to slip cuz the prison system got places for you
Don't get the picture, my nigga, here let me paint it for you
The same nigga's that say they love you and claim they loyal
Ain't gon' pay no lawyers or let alone, raise your babies for you
It don't make you real cuz there's diamonds inside your damn watch
And never left your hood, and you always reppin' your damn block
And It don't make you savage cuz you be totin' no damn Glocks
Or popped it at no opps, so you ran away from no damn cops
Or sold a bunch of grams, or be standin' over them damn pots
Or you stay in the field, like them lil nigga's off Sandlot
If you don't want your momma to see you up in no damn box
Just aim straight, for that ain't cool, like Ken shamrock
Used to watch rap city, had dreams to be at the damn top
Now labels on my dick, with hopes they can get my John Hancock
Nobody famous reached out to me, or gave me no damn shot
Lately I'm adding dough to my knots, until rubberbands pop
I caught a couple gun cases that still steel with him
My fans love when I'm going in for the kill, nigga
Like hopin' out whips with them pumps if I'm on your heels, nigga
You better heal, nigga, I'm just here to heal nigga's
Give em the real, you may never know how that feels, nigga
I don't complain or chill, I got too much will, nigga
Made it this far, and I did it without a deal, nigga
Just cuz you got a dead homie don't make you real, nigga
Every man dies, but not every man lives
And I'm thankful for my banks, like I married aunt Viv'
But I'm wonderin', why is hell still a punishment?
If they say Jesus died on that cross for, every man's sins
Nobody's safe, nobody's pure, nobody's sure
Your spots a maybe, you're crazy, no spots secure
Put God first, I don't make a move unless he's involved
Fightin' demons off while I'm droppin' jewels like I've seen it all

And you need to understand that and give them something, you know, give them something good, give them something they can use. You know, here and there. Instead of giving them all this, uh, bullshit, that they want, that the majority of people want, you know

Straight out the jungle watch for Anacondas
Only so far you can see stay prepared for the drama
Know my squad gotta eat, so we do what we gotta
All while we pray for the weak, we take food from the monsters
God strong and I’m conscious keep one eye on the watchers
In the valley of the shadow we keep that light upon us
Play no games with the Joker they’ll see dark nights it’ll be Gotham
Ready and willing if Walter in it we shootin’ like Contra
It’s gonna be shocking like Blanka
Chopping shit up like Baraka
Ain’t no need for the doctors just prayers or peace for the mamas
Then it’s back to the gwalla them dollars decimals and commas
Cuz I handle that business with no degree I’m a scholar
Don’t judge book by its cover you turn that page we will pop up
All I know is go get it me and my niggas is shottas
Amputate ya ‘bout paper at pussy necks like we collars
We'll hit ya then will forget ya nigga hakuna matata

Little nigga from the ninth floor, mom was on that white hard
Daddy was a vice lord, pistol sit in my drawls
Like a eagle I soar, like I lion I roar
Shorty keep that forty buddy lowkey like he fight Thor
So much blood on my sword yet there’s love for my lord
Banana clips for all you monkeys curious just like George
I’m a gorilla fearin’ no nigga, I’m a go getter with a pole wit ‘em
I got the thirty so it’s more than twenty cent when I hit his ass wit the four nickel
Way hotter than summer break make yo bitch do a double take
I come from a troubled place money longer than bubble tape
I take me and my money and two pistols on a double date
No safety bullets glisten at your squad before yo huddle break
These niggas sweet one shot a leave hole in 'em, funnel cake
Exterminate I come and spray I terminate ain’t nothing safe
I’m a humble nigga but my semi ain’t boy it spit and sing like it’s drizzy Drake
When I kick bo’s like I’m Billy Blanks it’ll wet a nigga like he in a lake
So you sell weight gettin’ plenty cake say you war ready but you really ain’t
I got hittas that a crack a head open for a little change like a piggy bank
Squad

Like lightning is strikin, like lighting is frightening
This world for the mighty, so come prepared to clash with the titans, yeah
I’m strapped like security flash my light like the night-shift
Heard you hard and heart cold okay well bitch ima ice pack
Shoot like David at Goliath got the power to slay the giants
Bitch ima lion
A beast in these streets ima tyrant
No library but these bitches keep quiet or its a riot
Come front with a struggle its dire
But everyone wanna be sire, till they feel the fire
That pistol part of my attire
?????
Bitch I’m the flyest

My flow is so real, its so ill they say its sicker than Ebola
I got the heart of a lion but my shit colder than Cobras

Look in the eyes of my enemies let em know ima solider
And for that bread I’ll burn you Montana stay with that toaster
My 7 up on you niggas you can get popped like a soda
This Gucci belt be my holster no I don’t smoke but I smoke ya
Squad
Rap God shit
Feel that
Got the god in this mother fucker
Yeah, all that

God is good, God is great, they swear up and down everyday he is
You better hope he's as merciful as they say he is
My bars is the craziest, lyrically I'm an alien
So much knowledge, scholars ain't never heard of the grade he in
Rap God is his alias, changin' minds of the atheists
Tourin', sharin' stages with loved ones 'cause that's the way he is
My mama called to see if we safe and told me she pray we is
And I am to my fans what Tom Brady is to the Patriots
Satan's nemesis, spittin' lyrics which you can benefit
To you it's only bars, I just wish you knew the significance
Life sentences, they don't know how much time I spent with it
I learnt it like an instrument, practice made me magnificent
Spoke about my pain and my struggles, that's how I strengthen it
Was willin' to go broke, I put all my dollars and cents in it
Took a break from shinin' and buyin' all that expensive shit
Became beneficent, now fuck nigga come try to blemish it
Always kill the devil quickly when you find him
God strong, came from them trenches straight out the bottom
I put my niggas on 'cause I love 'em, they know I got 'em
They got their bars up on their own I ain't gotta spot 'em
Squad drippin' sauce I bet some of you wanna rob 'em
Same niggas hatin' they fakin' want me to sign 'em
Pistols in designer, if there's ever a problem
We slide in with them mags on you pussies, it's not a condom
Niggas thought this shit was just rap up until I popped one
Like Tony wasn't frontin' that day he said he had shotgun
Gotta keep one on me, know I can go any day, boy
Slidin' hollow tips in the clips I can't wait to spray, boy
Magazines full of them bitches see I don't play, boy
Leave a nigga reekin' for thinkin' he Theon Greyjoy
When hope is lost, don't ever bail on your team
Don't Doubt The God and stand firm like you settin' the screen
There’s just one version of the truth you need to question your king
Sky's the limit, went from livin' in the 'jects to my dream
So fresh and so clean, it's cool to have a necklace that blings
But real leaders teach us lessons while they blessin' their teams
To live is to grind, we all on different missions to rise
Visualizin' bein' on top, I'm gon' stay willin' to climb
And none of us would value life if God didn't limit the time
We talk to clouds with hopes the ones we lost still live in the skies
You gotta show the Lord you're thankful when you're given this time
Success is proof that you've evolved and mastered difficult times
And no fish don't get to the bait because they missin' my lines
Maybe later in life when you mature, you'll get it in time
No one can ever mention bars without mentionin' mine
So sick with the rhymes, that every lyric pickin' ya mind
Some think that all they gotta do is pray for the best
Always lookin' for a shortcut and a way to finesse
King's vision, time's tickin', I ain't waitin' for next
Just like a fuckin' Chess game, bitch I'm chasin' the check
I'm an artist, hoe they on it, we get praises the best
I told them put they money up like we was makin' the bet
Gon' make 'em regret, always be real and make 'em respect
Don't get discouraged, people tend to love to hate on the best
My wisdom's unique, do you and let the critics critique
'Cause lions don't concern themselves with the opinions of sheep
Even my haters takin' notes and got my shit on repeat
It's gettin' deep like brother Malcolm out here givin' a speech
Gifted with intentions of redemptions such as healin' the weak
Put God first and never give up when you feelin' defeat
Be willin' to see, don't be another prisoner sleep
Life is a bitch and people change like that bitch named Mystique
Embracin' the pain, my nigga I was raised in the rain
Now I'm breakin' up chains, and I'm changin' the game
I do this with my eyes closed, drive a hater insane
Me and God give 'em Hell like Undertaker and Kane
And I don't depend on no man, got that from my old man
My mama told me no woman wants them a broke man
My bros said "You can make it", I said "We both can"
Came a long way, sleepin' counties, hearin' them doors slam
Used to be the dope man, every day I sold grams
Nowadays it's different, my pockets fatter than Roseanne
Big paper, I got that bag on me like the postman
Still prayin' daily, receivin' blessings in both hands
Armed with two sticks in this bitch, I feel like a snowman
Dead bodies all on your block, I turn it to ghost land
FGE the shit bitch you better get with the program
And every barbarian niggas out there think I'm Conan
Mimic when I lead on 'em, missions to succeed
Like a fuckin' backbreaker, nigga this is what they need
Punchlines like Apollo nigga, this is for my creed
Meaning this is for my seeds, I just hope you takin heed
Pray every day knowin' Satan waitin' for you to fall
I give praise to God because that's who helped me get through it all
Shawty bad as hell, yeah, check out that bitch body

Hate when I'm on the road, but she love when I'm inside her
I'm who she make time for, I whip it out, she climb up
Pin her to the wall, yeah, something like a poster
Then lay her on the bed, and do that pussy like I'm suppose to
I pull her hair and choke her, she love the way I stroke her
I pull out, no holster, and then I super soak her

Shawty bad as hell, yeah, check out that bitch body
Everything so perfect, love the way she ride me
Baby girl be stylin, these hoes trynna copy
Hella niggas jocking, but she only want my D

Baby girl be stylin, these hoes trynna copy
Hella niggas jocking, but she only want my D

She love to ride it
So go on, ride inside it
Make love inside it
You a pussy you get popped, no janitor I keep the mop
That bitch on me when I shop, so come my way like Fetty Wap
I slide for real I'm on your heels when I pull up no ankle socks
It's going down relax a nigga like Yung Joc straight at his top
Grew up in the 'jects, we use to hoop on them crates
Gang banging and holdin' up rakes
Start movin' that weight, was gettin' it from outer state
I chose the hustle to escape
While getting this cake, I had to kill a few snakes
I took my crookeds with my straights, hero with no cape
While making sure my people straight, I came out on top like a tank
Now bitch i'm the best, it is not up for debate
Always drop and crack like a vase, more views that a wake
I got what they want like a safe, my ex on my dick Triple H
No I'm not her man, but sometimes my belt got a H
My swagger from outer space
My new bitch is perfect, just right for me like I'm Drake
I eat that pussy like steak
She bad to the bone, she send naked pics to my phone
She keep my dick hard as a stone
Gettin' head on my throne, she lick a nigga no Patrón
Then slide on that D like a zone
I'm fly like a drone, I got to the top on my own
I didn't sell my soul to get known
Don't come at me wrong, you can get smoked like a bong
Then get yo ass put in my song
Two guns on my waist, big clips like Deandre and Blake
I slid through his home like his base
He ran like a race
Then bullets came out his face, I got out I might shoot like i'm ace
Check out my drip, whole bunch of Gs on my kicks
I look like I hit a lick
I put my niggas on, now my team inside like a pig
We on fire, we lit, call us Bic
I killed your homie,  like the Knicks
I told you i'm with the shits, 30 in my clip
I upped it and blew like a crip
But I'm Donatello with that stick
These niggas slaves, these niggas sellin' they souls
These labels pimpin' they hoes
Dyeing they hair, these niggas looking like trolls
Right now they gettin' exposed
You're not a boss, you niggas do as you're told
For the right price you will fold
I know that I'm cold, I'm bodying them like a robe
I just go in I'm like doors
I stay in my mode, bitch I stay grippin' that pole
I don't let go like 
While on the road, we caught a case with a pole
It got dropped because none of us told
Big faces, I be thumbin' through
My squad get money too
A bunch of Gs, on my fuckin' belt, and my luggage too
Take your bitch, fuck her from the back
Her dreams coming true
I fucked her good and she told all her friends
They wanna fuck me too
I put my faith, In god and my gun
I don't trust none of you
Had heat on me while I sat in class but it wasn't summer school
I shot niggas in these fucking streets then ball like Uncle Drew
I pop these pussies pill out on these bitches he Cliff Huxtable
Said I don't need a deal I make money moves
Said I don't gotta sign bitch I'm comfortable
If I see you and I don't speak well that means I don't fuck with you
It's FGE and I'm the CEO this what that money do
They never thought it would happen this rappin' stuff
Was facing cases because I got caught with gats and stuff
My haters thought I wouldn't elevate from that trappin' stuff
And fuck twelve they want me back in the back with cuffs
God knows my needs that's why I never ask for much
I work for mine I swear I never had good luck
My past was rough, my moms was high my dad was drunk
Start baggin' up, I used to feed my mattress bucks
Rap god a.k.a. hip hop's asthma pump
Don't pass I'm clutch I'm gladiator Maximus
About my bills when I spit like I'm Daffy Duck
Expose the truth then turn and tell your pastor, "church"
They want beef until I give 'em what they askin' for
They ratchet tucked Bruce Wayne the way we maskin' up
We ride with straps you niggas better fasten up
I keep the pump in my whip like I'm gassin' up
That's big sticks when we slide and we don't pass the puck
The only time they want smoke is when you pass the blunt
We on your lawn with them choppas like your grass gettin' cut
I blast, I bust, you die you just got whacked and touched
Your bitch in heat
She say she want me bad as fuck
The head was good
Deep throat like a giraffe and stuff
She gagged and sucked
Bitch damn near made me crash my truck
The ass was pumped, I did my thing I smashed, I fucked
And you ain't winning if you spendin' more than stackin' up
If you ain't mastering the math of your cash, you'll flunk
I'm FGE, them Titans scared to clash with us
I'm in my bag bitch don't ever think I'm packin' up
Way before the rappin' bitch I was trappin' I used to touch bands
I got to that bag from the floor just like a dustpan
How is there so much creativity up in one man?
Giving kids food for their thoughts I feel like a lunch man
Niggas spent their last on a pair of shoes with a jumpman
Feeling like a mill when he walk, he must be a Bucks fan
And I'm no longer stuffing pounds in the duffle, son
I stay on you 'cause I care to see you smile and I love you
If you don't add to the big picture  you won't value the puzzle
Please teach your kids that life is awesome
Sometimes allow 'em to struggle
And if they spend more than they stack
Then they won't value the hustle
If you can't nip shit in the bud and push then how you the muscle
Huh? Boss shit, call up my hitters and tell 'em tell fam
Hop out, put that strap to his head like he Quailman
Replace the hammers used and then pay him after they nail fam
What you know about killers comin' dressed as a mailman
My homie told me I really don't think they ready, fam
I bet he drop when I roll up on him just like the jelly, fam
We cuttin' I put that on my blood just like a band-aid
We comin' 'round that bitch blowing at you faster than fan blades
See, I just wanna see every one of my mans paid
Mama in the mansion relaxing, don't need a damn thing
Drinkin' lemonade with her feet up under the damn shade
Niggas didn't wanna believe me until them bands came
Knowing when I go in I'm known to go on a rampage
Madness written all over they faces like Macho Man shades
It's like, ever since I got my bag right (woo!)
All these bitches wanna act nice
It's money over bitches I'm pimpin' 'em like a Cadillac
Bitches know I'm lit yeah I got 'em drippin' like candle wax
Thinkin' 'bout the top, reachin' for my belt like a ladder match
He say he want smoke plus his bitch on my pipe, I had to crack
Rap god, baby, my lyrics could cure cataracts
Arsonal just said, "niggas lucky that you don't battle rap"
The fake be flippin' sides for that money just like an acrobat
The real ones gonna ride through them ups and downs
Like a camel's back
One life in God's house
Ain't no second life where the attic at
From the struggle I had to grind to get out my habitat
Orange and green buds by the pound
It's looking like Apple Jacks
Four hundred forty-eight
When I package that, clients back to back
Matter of fact, only you pussy niggas get mad at facts
I put that on my sons it ain't really nothin' to have you whacked
If Kris Kross, he can get thirty up out they Daddy Mac
That's thirty for you haters, I'm shooting tell 'em come hack-a-Shaq
Pictures with my kids in my cribs ain't no need to caption that
Ain't nothin' like the hugs from your cubs
When they know they daddy back
My daughter mother strapped, .22 in that Gucci fanny pack
Plus I dropped a bag on her kicks, nigga that's hacky sack
G-O-D my chauffeur he opened that damned door for us
Labels ain't controllin' us, ballin' like no one's holdin' us
Every line's potent that's why they come get they dope from us
And this is not a brothel, I promise you ain't no hoe in us
Big choppas, takin' off tops, that's can openers
The bullets in my clip, yellin', "pussy come get a load of us"
Teflon in my jacket, I'm Spawn with that ratchet
Put pawns in a casket, who wants to get it crackin'?
I'm a hundred like Wilt, tell your nigga he ain't built
If he act rowdy I'ma pipe her, then that nigga gettin' killed
Skrrt off up in traffic bitch I'm smooth like silk
Left him wet and what came out that .40 cal wasn't milk
Know your part, go home if you ain't goin' hard
The coldest art that's ripping rappers' souls apart
Came from the bottom I ain't going back like Rosa Parks
These other rappers don't compare to me like Noah's Ark
(x2)
It ain't nothin' but that bullshit on shorty brain
Don't think that shorty playin', look how shorty came
You see that 30 clip up off that 40 hang
Shorty let that 40 bang, let that 40 bang

Niggas think that it's a game, let that 40 bang
Let em know that you ain't playin', let that 40 bang
Put that thang up to his brains, let that 40 bang
Now everybody in the city sayin' shorty name
Gettin' scared everytime that they see shorty out
Hopin' he don't pull that mutha fuckin' 40 out
Cause they know he don't give a fuck, they know that shorty wild
Only two words that he know(what's that), that's 40 cal
30 clip extended, if he feel offended
Shorty squeezin' that trigger, til that mutha fucka empty
That's just how he do it, he know what he doin'
Once he off that 40, ain't no talkin' bitch he shootin'
Tear drops all in his face and in his trigger fingers
All he need is his 40 and his trigger fingers
Fuck a fuck nigga and fuck what that nigga thinkin'
Come to his spot and air him out, leave that nigga stinkin'
(x2)
It ain't nothin' but that bullshit on shorty brain
Don't think that shorty playin', look how shorty came
You see that 30 clip up off that 40 hang
Shorty let that 40 bang, let that 40 bang

He tatted up like tunechi, stay up in some gucci
Prolly in a black wing, he hop up out that hooptee
Then he get excited, cause you niggas look like groupies
All you niggas pussy, watch that 40 cal eat coochie
Where shorty from my nigga everyday is doomsday
So he stay with that 40 like they roommates
Hit up the block and let that mutha fuckin tool spray
And leave all you niggas lyin', April fool's day
He be on that killa shit, shorty far from innocent
You know what the business is, one of yo niggas been a vic
Right now you fuckin with a nigga that don't give a fuck
Ain't talkin phone numbers when I say shorty hit em up
It's 300, you already know what they're about
2 steps, find out his whereabouts and air him out
Now he flexin' on you niggas Arnold Schwarzenegger
Try to reach for shorty chain, watch my 40 bang
(x2)
It ain't nothin' but that bullshit on shorty brain
Don't think that shorty playin', look how shorty came
You see that 30 clip up off that 40 hang
Shorty let that 40 bang, let that 40 bang

If them niggas want beef, let that 40 bang
If them niggas think it's sweet, let that 40 bang
Ain't gotta meet me in the streets to let that 40 bang
I'll bring that shit to where you sleep, let that 40 bang(BANG!!!)
Came in the game as a young nigga tryna' get guap
From the land of the dark play it smart or yo' ass get popped
Gotta roll with the pole in the van with the bros totin' Glocks
Had to grind to the top non-stop now we got shit locked

Real nigga checkin' in
Pounds of that loud is what I was investing in
Ambitious as I've ever been
I sold specimens while I was fly like a pelican
Rap god you know how I'm rockin' the devil keep knockin' I try not to let him in
I give hell to the demons that's meddlin' only a fool talk shit with no evidence
They sick in the head like ring worms & speakin' the truth is the medicine
Kidnap em for questionin', then watch him go nuts in the trunk like an elephant
He gon' talk David Letterman, while you beg for yo' life don't insult my intelligence
Make you open yo' mouth, stick my weapon in light your shit up I think I'm Thomas Edison. AH!
Started off in my dad's house, then to the trap house once I started getting that cash out
Garbage bags full of weight but to my next door neighbors look like I was takin' the trash out
Turn my pain and my struggle into hustlin' bubble now I got that bag now
I get paid just to spazz out, lyrics so hot when I made them thank god I didn't pass out
What's your IQ in the streets what you gon do with this beef Think everything cool you gon see better learn how to move with the heat
I lay right by my tool when I sleep, ready to put two in a creep
Then they cover you up with sheets, link back up with my crew then we eat


Bitch I'm a maverick, used to do magic with a pencil and a tablet
Now I got it mastered, my craft is vast and shapeless these haters can't grasp it
I been had that bag bitch, all up in traffic, flipping money like gymnastics
If shit got as dry as a desert no joke couple niggas got poked like a cactus
Man I'm too galactic never lost focus real niggas they don't get distracted
Haters not in my bracket, they gon need; Jesus, themself, and a whole lot of practice
They think they gon' come up off dissing me
They cannot fuck with me lyrically
I make whoever hear me remember me
I black out then I go on a killing spree
I got bars like they sentence me no penitentiary, I know these fuck niggas sick of me
My .45 got a lemon squeeze, I be swaggin' like I come from Italy
I told bro and em get money by any means
Then show them what I meant like parentheses
I made Benjamin Franklin sprint to me, we so close you would think he's some kin of me
Oh yeah I had some friends turn to enemies, then I turned Two-face into Mr. Freeze
I showed up but I didn't show no sympathy
Pussy niggas got smoked like a chimney
I come from the land where it's dark at
Had to learn how to swim where them sharks at
They sell rocks on the blocks all while dodgin' the cops, totin' Glocks and the opps who we spark at
(Sniffles)
Do you Smell that?
Do You?
(Sniffles)
It smells like smoke?
Is it a fire?
There’s a fire in the church!

This is that call from your plug saying the drought is over
I'm gods most ruthless and wildest soldier, my style ferocious
While y'all was drinking and y'all was smoking, this child was sober
Spitting more fire on tracks than dragons with halitosis
Flood in the game like the rain that never showered Noah
Piling my dough up, them pounds was coming from South Dakota
Had garbage bags of that loud as strong as the foulest odor
Had a long road to success, that bitch wasn't right around the corner
Know times got hard I still vowed to blow up like loud explosions
While counting dough up stood next to sinners like power forwards
From West street niggas get murdered before they child will grow up
With hopes he'll come back like Jesus, but highly doubt he'll show up
Hustled with homies from high school, fell out, and now it's over
Used to love whips with big rims, so haters we towered over
All white seats inside the Chevy, looking like powdered donuts
You should've seen how the crowd would go nuts
They bow before us
I used to dream of being paid like this, I
Got hella tracks that I done slayed like this, I
Never thought I'd get out that maze like this
Ain't never changed up, Montana always stayed like this, see
These other rappers, they ain't made like this, no
You gotta read to turn the page like this
All praise the god, they ain't know that he made grenades like this
And niggas hate but even Jesus had days like this (wooh!)
So much Fire in the Church, the choir had a heatstroke
Youngin' got the streets sewed, let my haters deep-throat
.40 in my pea-coat, slide on em' like a ski slope
Change em' like a remote, place em' in that deep hole
Right now I'm in beastmode, it's like I got a cheat code
I see another side of the door, just like a peephole
I keep my guard up cause GOD ain't the author
I wear my pain like it's armor, my battles just made me smarter
A murderer like my father, two straps on me like a farmer
Clip to your head like a barber, I bus yo ass like a charter
Come back around like I'm karma, then witnesses gettin' slaughtered
Take off like dearly departure, flow hard, that bitch need a carpet
I got a lil bitch from Spartus, slid in her walls like a charger
Plus I can have a Minaj with two sisters like I was Roger
Yeah, both of them wanna do me, they sweat a nigga like Coogi
One black, the other one mixed, call em' bitches Scooby and Snoopy
Got groupies tryna pursue me, I'm good, I'll pass on that coochie
Plus, lust is the death of duty, I'm grindin' till God remove me
When it's go time, I blow mine, I'll be in and out in no time
And that newspaper gon' cosign, that I shows up when it's showtime
I'll kill your ass and then say shit, like God said it was your time
If you niggas want it then mo-dime, blow their brains out, I don't mind
Been shootin' shit like Kodak, niggas used to ask me, "where the hoes at?"
I was gettin' money way before rap, I was hustlin', movin' dro packs
And I made a decision, I lost all my mother's conditions, while I never sold crack
Only givin' truth, tell em' hoes that
Touchin' more souls than a doormat
And I wonder where my life would be, if God wasn't on the side of me
Responding to me quietly, enhancing my psychiatry
I fight demons daily, baby, Satan's still my rivalry
Declinin' all his bribery, the lord would never lie to me
Fact was in the argument, and you don't have to die to see
I've broadened my horizon, like I'm watchin' from the highest tree
My words hold the truth, I got shit locked, just like a diary
I put my own self on nigga, I should get a finder's fee
This world is cold, I'm pourin' more, restorin' souls, applyin' heat
The more we know, the more we blow, now picture hip-hop minus me
They hate behind my back, tip-toe and whisper while the giant sleeps
My videos, they spy and creep, see me, show love, and try to speak
God told my squad it's time to eat, I can't help who ain't grind with me
All honesty and modesty, all while I built my dynasty
What lies beneath, disguised as sheep, the wisest beast, surprise it's me
Defined elite, designed with ink, my fine physique looks kind of Greek
My minds unique, sometimes discrete, and I just want the blind to see
That God does not have hiding spots, so nigga this ain't hide and seek
You only pray to God when you want something, so your bond is weak
I pray to tell him thank you just for blessing me beyond belief
Like him, I'm who they dyin' to meet, play games with me, that price is steep
I'm sleepin' them like private suites, he'll get shot, Hepatitis B
Like anything with value nigga, what's on the inside is key
Righteously, I try to be, shine light on that side of me
I spit what I take in, can't keep it down, like fuck who tryna sleep
Plus, Fire in the Church just dropped, and every rapper died this week
God!

You know I stay lit like a candle
20 bands up in my pants ho

From the slaughterhouse boy I will slaughter you
Bangers and bitches on me when I'm walking through
You get wet like Poseidon when I come through
Slide and your death will be so mythological
I got bodies so watch who you talking to
Those who play will get changed like an audible
I put all of you up in an article
Then go sauce on your bitch honey barbecue
So shawty go nuts she went crazy
She was cleaning my pipe tryna drain me
Money changing but I'm still the same me
When them fuck niggas die boy they blame me

Shawty go nuts she go crazy
I got these bitches wet cause I'm wavy

I can't fuck with you bitch you fugaze
I will drip on a bitch like I'm raining

Dirty dancin' bitch I'm Patrick Swayze

If they ain't fight in that fire

Stay alive and stay focused

My day one homie jus told me
Tony don't give me Nathan
It feels amazing just seeing
One of my niggas make it
And then I thanked him
For being loyal and never changing
Remaining true and not being
One of dem niggas hatin'

Inside of niggas basements
Promised my girl

Cut back on sinning
And changed the way I was living

Yo’ favorite rappers couldn't match me if they teamed up

Everything, no less than 50, bang bang!
You better hide, you know I'ma slide, bang bang!
When I ride it's gon' be a homicide, bang bang!
Every time I come around your city, bang bang!
Everything, no less than 50, bang bang!
You better hide, you know I'ma slide, bang bang!
When I ride it's gon' be a homicide, bang bang!

I make bitches in your city scream like Sidney when they trip
If you see me, come get with me if you really with the shits
I don't internet like Drizzy and Meek Milly with this shit
Curtis Jackson in my ratchet I got 50 in my clip
If I give your ass a day, you won't live to see the fame
You want to explain, but I want to see your brains
Been there, done that, you don't want none of that
Cock my gun back, let it bang
I be with a bunch of crooks, nigga
One in the neck, like a crook, nigga
When I come around, open up a round, like a hook, nigga
Slide on them squares, like a rook, nigga
All headshots, yearbook, nigga
Blowin' like a ref, with this fuckin' tec
Like a fuckin' chef, I cook niggas
Body bag him up, like some kush, nigga
Wet that pussy up, that's douche, nigga
Got your day one homies, all shook, nigga
Now they talkin' 'bout, he was a good nigga
Whatchu know 'bout standing in the cold waitin'
'Bout to give it to him, like a donation
Gun clappin', like a standing ovation
Been droppin' niggas, no probation
Squad

Every time I come around your city, bang bang!
Everything, no less than 50, bang bang!
You better hide, you know I'ma slide, bang bang!
When I ride it's gon' be a homicide, bang bang!
Every time I come around your city, bang bang!
Everything, no less than 50, bang bang!
You better hide, you know I'ma slide, bang bang!
When I ride it's gon' be a homicide, bang bang!
I put in that work young nigga livin' his dreams
I came out them trenches like Sting
Remember them days when I used to sit on them swings
And watch niggas dealin' to fiends
They served to my mama wish I had a burner to pop 'em
You don't know the feeling it brings
I feel like the Hulk I used to have rips in my jeans
But I had to get to the green
I swallowed the odds, because I'm anointed with God
The devil can't get in between
Gripping my chrome while I sit on my throne
Tell them niggas come on ain't no killin' the king
You'll die in the summer for talking that shit in the spring
So fall down like you sipping that lean
If you ain't from here you the visiting team
You gon' leave in a stretcher ain't no limousine
Brace yourself for the truth it may hurt a bit
The good thing about pain is you learn from it
Make sure your desire survives through the fire
The disappointment and discouragement
Better move like you know what your purpose is
Never say die, learn to fly through that turbulence
Stop placing the blame you say it's God's
But really you don't know whose word it is
Gotta know who the serpent is know they oppress us
That bitch got more game than a tournament
In the church is the prayer from your preacher
That's program gets paid to perform at the services
If it ain't ether cancel it verses ain't tampered with
Rap god and my word is permanent
I pack heat in my head like a perm in it
So you know how I roll like a percocet
One thing for certain is whoever purchased this
Gone say it's worth it he murdered it
Don't forget so we know what we working with
If they try it we riot like Ferguson
Earthquake so I step on your stomping grounds
When it come to my kids I don't fuck around
Do whatever to not hear they stomach growl
Play with mine you gon' learn how that thunder sounds
Bitch you better be real good at ducking down
Before you know what it's like to sleep underground
If you'd like then my .40 could dumb it down
I'm so cold I could cool any summer down
Took my time gave it thought like a chess move
Weigh my options then go make my best move
I do this shit for my fam
I took that shot for my blood like a flesh wound
Never answering questions no press room
Talking foul might get hit with this tech soon
So don't get me pissed 'cause I'll go do that shit
And then go wash my hands like a restroom
Give your bitch the business like a manager
Pussy pink beat it up 'til it's lavender
How I fuck she gon' think he was amateur
I don't smoke I don't drink I got stamina
I'm a boss I got all of the sauce
So these hoes in my face want a taste like a sampler
Tell my haters they not my of caliber
I get checks on you squares like a calendar
Bitch I ate off the web no tarantula
Dragon spit now I'm rich as a Lannister
I am killing all rappers it's massacre
When I drop yo' Baywatch like she Pamela
Better get out or dodge I ain't talkin' 'bout cars
When I tell you I'm whippin' all challengers
I held onto the Lord and I felt the support
Every step of the way like a banister
Life's a bitch but I know how to handle her
I stay strapped down to ride like a passenger
And I'm good with the mop and if I spot a opp
I hop clean on his ass like a janitor
So you better wise up 'cause it's overdue
Be a fan of reality know the truth
Go look far and look deep like an ocean view
But be cautious when they cannot show you proof
When it seems like it's hell that you going through
And them devil's demons got a hold of you
Gotta let ambition take control of you
Watch God open that door and then show for you
So just embrace the pain
And smile in the face of the rain
When them clouds coming over you
And watch who you selling to, not only that, man
You gotta watch who's on that boat with you
And if they didn't roll with you
Don't let them roll with you
Listen, I do not mean smoke with you
And it don't mean a nigga won't snitch
Just because he was broke with you
And he would blow for you
I've seen niggas tell on they homies
Just 'cause they'd feel better
If it was the both of you
And yeah, you love your family and friends
But sometimes it's important
To let them hear no from you
I stay ready whenever I'm rolling through
When a snake has no options he'll go for you
Rap god I'm goat to you, bringing that dope to you
You niggas wish that I wrote for you
Started rapping with bro like we Outkast
Do a show then I feed my account cash
I came up off the floor like a bounce pass
So don't call me unless it's about cash
I'm fucking eating no Ramadan
I fucked a Muslim on Ramadan
I was trapping wasn't working no nine to five
The pizza I was selling wasn't no Papa John's
Selling with my niggas like I'm a star
Guns and drugs was the shit that we idolized
I stay ready to blow and this shit not for sure
Bitch I fire up this pole then I'm popping mine
No talking no sparking there's blood everywhere
So you already knowing what's popping, slime
I'll teach you a lesson with my Smith & Wesson
Boy, don't make me take you to Columbine
Y'all know how I'm rocking
My rocket got 34 haters
I'm Hakeem Olajuwon
When I slide I'ma blow like a hockey ref
Put his ass in the box if he out of line
Rap god the phenomenon God is my confidant
I'm way too smart to run out of lines
You'll never see me like Conor McGregor vs. Mayweather in the octagon
I just take names like a dotted line, then go kill everyone I could find
Niggas don't wanna see me like father time, pulling up in that van like a soccer mom
Sliding drums in my guns when it's choppa time, then I let that bitch sing like it's Chaka Khan
My K waving hello, I stay with the metal, was raised in the ghetto
I ain't finna settle, I came here to bless you
Let's pray for the devil, he ain't on my level

Moment of silence, let's pray for the blind
Someone you never met is who made up your mind
See the way you designed, ain't the way of the wise
And the way you designed, ain't the way to survive
It's either one of two things
Jesus Christ ain't ever coming or he just like taking his time
Told you earthlings to obey your earthly master
Boy, you don't see the hate in the lies?
And to fear him and tremble as if he was Christ
That ain't godly that's Satan disguised
Pussy ass niggas saying I ain't got no bodies haha
They gonna make me go back to the old me
WOO

Mask off, you niggas mad soft
"Please help me God", that's gon' be your last thought
I shoot em up, like a rocket, blast off
Im on your ass after I blast, I do the dash and smash off
That road is dark, asphalt
Get nailed like Jesus if your pussy ass cross
I see through that shit you talking, like a fuckin' glass jaw
And you should take a fucking bow, you rappers actors, Shad Moss
The price to win is to go work your ass off
If you don't get it, I'm gon' it you gon' get yo ass moss'd
If you still looking for God, well thats because your ass lost
He's within you, y'all don't get it like a fucking bad toss
No longer broke, like I just took my cast off
Before the fame bitch, I been and had sauce
Pounds of dro, I had to get that gas off
I used to pray on the highway that I don't get my ass caught
I left the trap, took off a rap, I splash sauce
$2800 what my Gucci bag cost
Come take a picture, I'm so bright that you could take your flash off
I treat your bitch like a baton, she will get hit then passed off
I know you sick and you nauseous
Imposters mock us, they not us
Same niggas always hating, always watch us
Fuck niggas tryna knock us, won't prosper
Word to my mom I'm bout drama
You won't rob her son, I'm not Oscar
You niggas sweeter than peach cobbler
Space Jam, my roster's got monsters
Shoot like Spike Lee coming with the choppas
Might be slightly off of my rockers
Might pop your medulla oblongata
Shots turn you flodgers into dodgers
Leave you lyin' there dead, like Mufasa
My lyrics liver like shather
Evert beat I touch is gonna get conquered
I go unconscious, I go bonkers
I snap like lobster, rap god
I got way more flavour than mambas
Fly til I die like La Bamba
They see my swagger persona
Wanna jack it, like a bomber
My own logo on my joggers
Lots of green on me like Blanca
My pockets fatter than E Honda
I'm about my business, come proper
Labels can't call me like Shaka
My words can heal like a doctor
My guns turn dreads into pasta, uhhhunn
Talking like he gotta steel body
Out of arms reach, they be real cocky
3 gun cases, steel still by me
Real tear drops, real bodies
When I'm poppin his ass, like a lil Molly
They gon' claim I hit him, no Bill Cosby
Leave his head red, drop dead Fred, they gon' think somebody killed Lil Yachty
Cut out the flexing, you ain't built, you ain't a wrestler
But kick it off and I'll return it, Devin Hester
I put that steel on you pussy cats, like Sylvester
Blowing like a ref like I'm showing them how that tech work
Your girl probably never told you I f'ed her
She sucked my dick, so you know I know how that neck work
They way her neck jerk, I swear she was an expert
I promise I could make her give my crew neck like a sweatshirt
Dick-riding, obviously you're the expert
You probably cum on yourself if I told you lets work
And since my name on the song, it'll be your best work
We are not the same, you lame, go check my net worth
Stop barking nigga, Im Jordan, Pippin
You're pussy ass ain't starting nigga
I'm pulling up and parking nigga
Hopping out and sparking nigga
Cold with the Tommy, put a funny nigga on TV like Martin nigga
When I cross his ass, imma drop his ass, then cook his ass, James Harden nigga
AAAAHHHH
Free my nigga J Real man
FGE shit, Rap God
Finna kill 4 remixes in one day
First remix since a nigga been home from jail
Uhhuuhh
Got money in two different cities I was selling packs
Three pistol cases even 12 know that I never lack
Yo FGE! Ain't it a blessing?
We put God first 'stead of complaining and stressing
How we came up from nothing hustlin' now we fly like the Jetsons
Ain't it a blessing that we're free and still in each other’s presence
Yo G-O-D, thanks for the blessing
When 12 searched us and found that Smith & Wesson
They locked us up and asked us questions
Tried to change the direction
My niggas didn't let 'em finess 'em for a fuckin' confession
Uhhuh
Kick doors in my Timbos, uppin' big poles
Get smacked with the pistol, leave your shit swole
Fall back nigga limbo if it ain't ten-fold
Pop that pussy like a nympho or a pimp hoe
Still reminiscing on them days when I was broke as hell
Till I set grams up on the scale yeah I had dro for sale
Didn't get high off my supply so I was smoking L's
I had shit planned I never thought that I would go to jail
Be reading books and doing push-ups in a holding cell
Had CO's bringing me bundles of all my open mail
I know the system's against us and we supposed to fail
The white walkers amongst us youngers is cold as hell
They came to my block I was plottin' bitch I was loading shells
Brought toys to school inside my bookbag it wasn't show and tell
You niggas hate 'cause I'm speaking facts and I'm dope as hell
You should've seen them crackers faces when I posted bail
Been fighting demons all my life I swear I know 'em well
I'll take your life then act surprised if I do go to jail
Came from a portal, Rap God I'm immortal
Tats on my torso got cheese like Digiorno
Pockets like bolo whores (horse) on me no polo
I roll up no yo-yo then cut like I'm Zoro
This monster is armed thats on foenem no Goro
Leave pussy wet watch me do it no porno
Tony always beast and you niggas know that's the mode he in
Trippin' splashing sauce on your TV like Nickelodeon
Ballin' like I'm Kobe and Mike on 'em like a podium
Broski blowin loud like a dynamite no Napoleon
Foreign thing, all on my dick, shawty Cambodian
Don't slip I'll come with that mop, like a custodian
When I show up niggas shut up they don't know what he on
His homie played them games with me and now his buddy gone
They wanna stand by your side when they know your money long
Now watch how many disappear when you tell 'em your money gone
Niggas been praying on my downfall
Don't cross that line like a foul ball
I might have to let a hundred rounds off
AK-47 with me it'll kill a clown y'all
Wet 'em and dead 'em before I let 'em take my crown off
Dreams of killin' 12 turn a pig to a groundhog
Too fuckin high and godly to ever be around y'all
Flow so deep, go over heads I could drown y'all
New fans searching for my tracks like a hound dog
Didn't have a penny but I done made my family proud y'all
Squaaaa
Shout out to the home Tee Grizzley too man, keep doing your thing man much love
And shout out to my squad FGE shit man you already know what it is man Rap God

Until I come through after dark, with big choppers like a shark

Still, I suit up, bring them boys to put that lil shit out like a firetruck
Speakin' of trucks I'm a monster, you talkin' 'bout rollin', better get your tires up
No energy services but when I visit your home it's to light it up
You love em, we tie em up
'Less I feel like their time is up
It ain't grade school but we line em up
Anything sweet, it's some kind of dust
While you be with the rats like you Donald Duck
It's irrelevant to put the nail on the reason they hatin' us
Just know if you pull a hoe,  reap what you sow, like I sold a penny, I'm takin' one
One after one, 'till they payin' up
Bodies gon' drop if they get out of hand
When this at your ear, you gon' hear what I'm sayin'
All of that dirt gon' turn into quicksand
Too late to get out the shit that you in
Set's in yo throat
I guarantee you gon' choke
Your section don't want no smoke

Ashes to ashes, you go

Cookin' em just like a frying pan
I bet money that pussy won't try again
Tony keep the steel on him like iron man
You better hope that my iron jam
Got a .40 with a 30 in this bitch and it don't hold back
Try to run up, ran up on him in the mornin', made that bitch go brrap
Try to pull it with my niggas pullin' triggers, boy yo ass gon' die
All facts, no lie, put that strap to his neck, bowtie
Get smoked like a cluck
Like asthma I come with that pump
Don't get your ass popped like a trunk
Flow cold like a hockey rink but I will slide like a puck
Pull up sprayin' like I was a skunk
I don't give no fuck

Was runnin' your mouth, now you ran out of luck

I'm too much to press
Step down and get swept down
Like fuckin' stairs
Leggo my eggo, how I like cuttin' squares
One click I'ma load a clip, I'm about to go live
Get spent like 90 cents, that's two shots from the 45
That way they can't drop no dimes, get it?
Thats a hunnid nigga no lies, like a nigga really know God
Livin, but the truth said so free and I'm so fly
I walk in a spirit, like I was born a ghost
And I'm no magician, but I'll get you gone in smoke
Dock like you on a boat, see headshots in your horoscope
Boy I'm rock like boilin' coke
Ever think that you can horn a goat, better realize you on a slope
Shit'll go down, like bundles we roll out
Red dots on your nose, clown
Fireman, you get hosed down
Watch you shake like it's cold out
Hail Mary on the go route
How we scorin, who runnin'
We always go 100, yeah
And the worst when I catch up and leave you like I'm forgettin' something
And then I get back to my sense, I mean, it's back to the money
Legend on the mic I preserve, then wrap it like a fuckin' mummy
And I do it for the ones who love me
And those who came out that muddy
Want change, haters get the nickel
Thats the thing, it cap for the dummies
See, levelin' up it's a specialty
Go hard or go home it's the recipe
I been outcast like a refugee
Know that water like I trot the seven seas
So I plan to ball hard in every league
On guard with them clips like I'm beverly
Callin' all the bullshit like a referee
And I kick this shit off like a special team, squaa

FGE shit man, y'all know how squad comin' man
'Tigue shit
I'm at that door like an usher
Feel my balls like they punctured
It's No Fatigue on the beat
Go follow me no instructions
My niggas movin' with structure
Be patient, niggas be rushin'
Streets not a game, this ain't pixel
I hope that you owe us something
Just bought some new poles, they came in just like a rookie
If she mine, I don't trip, I go Luscious for my cookie
I'm Mighty Joe when I'm Young, that bitch wanna fuck with me
Yo bitch said she want the D, oh, watch out for that tree
I be feelin' like I'm Caesar it ain't mini just like me
Smarter than what you think, I get shit done in a blink
Gotta hit her with that tommy, bring that power where you sleep
R.I.P. Prodigy I be with Mob, like I'm Deep
Won't spend on niggas like linen
Flex on 'em from the beginnin'
Talkin' bout hoes on my dick, I got a lot like a dealer
He cross me leave him in hot sauce, no I can't go like I'm blocked off
Bitch I go in like the locks off, hoes try lock me down like I'm popped off
Niggas change just like majin buu, up like in Chyna
Send him he shootin' and robbin' you
First they start jockin' you then they start mockin' you
Hatin' and tryna put a stop to you
Niggas be lame anyway, step on squares and light 'em up, MJ
Then I go blow on some MJ, this shit you hit get the rent paid
She slide me that cookie and I give yo baby D
She up in here tryna mate with me
Not in my circle then you get that K on me
Do not come get in my way on me
Didn't fuck with me until I got glow
I cuff that bitch like the waist on me
I bet them niggas gon' hate on me
I bet them bitches gon' wait on me

Yeah!
FGE shit, Mob shit
You know we run this shit
You know what it is, big pimpin' since a little nigga
Life's a gamble, I just get my cards, and I deal with it
Shake them haters off, take that shit just like a boss
I lost homies I lost money but I never took a loss
Comin' from the jungle with them alligators no Lacoste
Come through all black like the Raiders throwin' bullets, Derek Carr
Long range, and you bitches know my name
If you wanna play them games with me
Nigga you can die, like it's Saw
Put them targets on yo jaws, put your brains on the walls
Just so I can see that goofy ass shit that you thought
Knock you off and beat the case, they catch me I do the race
Real shit, Will Smith I'm an enemy of the state
I got hitters in the NO they blitzin' shit like the Saints
Do this shit so confidential, knock you off them tinted windows
Wash it down return the rental while I'm laughing to the bank
Big cash, big gold chain, chrome pistol
Fly Guy, sub-zero 'cause a nigga kicks cold
Niggas change, bitches change, you know how this shit go
Live fly, if a nigga try, put him in the sky
On these beats, ain't no other niggas eatin' like mine, squaa

Rap God, FGE shit man
You already know what it is man
CP5 in this bitch man
I spit fire like Pete's Dragon
Got more game than season passes
Stay up in expensive shit and I ain't talkin' Caesar's Palace
Dress and drip no caesar salad
Haters mug ain't even savage
Lookin' hard no reading glasses
Easily could lead to caskets
I got this shit mastered like Leroy
I been in my glo like I'm Sho'nuff
These pussy niggas got no nuts
These niggas gayer than gold dust
Don't none of my shooters give no fucks
For they bread they gon' pop up with toasters
For that dough they put holes in you, doughnuts
You don't wanna meet up it ain't cold cuts
With this draco nigga I'm cold as ice
They disrespectful but when I show up I swear they so polite
I ain't with the talking big choppas on me no overbite
I bet I shoot the crap out them bitches like I was rolling dice
Turned 'em into packs, I had to murder me some cats
Left big shells on the ground that's Ninja Turtles on they backs
Bitch I'm saucy you just salty, I got flavor every season
And I'm ballin', bitch I got them blue faces like Lance Stephenson
I water the seeds that I've planted until I'm under Earth
I push my son on that court like he Jesus Shettleworth
Some winners fail but don't be a quitter, there's nothing worse
Possess a hunger so strong that your fucking stomach hurt
Rap God, I'm who they call the man, I'm so fly never gotta walk again
But if I ever do I just bought some land, I take all your bitches
Turn them all to fans
I be saucin' when I hit the mall with bands
Fifty thousand in my jogger pants
Keep the green on me like a Boston fan
Ballin' with my bros, Big Baller Brand, squaa!

Shoulda' cut a niggas throat with a blade give him gill slits
Poke a nigga, soak a nigga on some Navy Seal shit
Niggas know I been sick, niggas know I been raw
And on these tracks I go stupid like a send off
And you ain't fuckin' with me and even all of your homies know

Tell my haters I said fuck em' they can't stop the operation
Tell the ops I'm not a doctor, therefore I ain't got the patience

Bitch I'm the terminator, antisocial, word to my neighbors
I heard that they heard I made it, done cut off they circulation
I remember pushing packs up in restaurants serving waiters
I've been 300 so long that even the Persians hate us
It's food for thought when I spit, I ain't talking regurgitation
All my features hella hot like they purchased the verse from Satan
No matter how hard life gets, I'mma put in that work today
When I come up I praise the lord like I live in the church's basement
I'll purge on the world and take it, then pick up the earth and shake it
Now you fixing to get killed like the person that's nursing Jason
Come get you, I'll find a way
On your ass, like no time to waste
I'll get to dropping, start blowing my pistols, like bombs away
Fuck 12, they won't find a trace
Closed casket, they'll hide your face
God is good, God is great, bitch I'm rare, I'm like God's mistake
If God is fake like April fools, well I guess someone lied to me
No matter how much truth I find, I will always find time to pray
Like NBA it's safe to say that I've been blessed with the mic
These other rappers turn em up, but they not blessing em right
I spit the truth, that shit that might just change a reverend's life
Bitch I'm so fly that I can tell yo ass what heaven looks like
Lil bitch I'm Barry Bonds mixed with Farrakhan
Runnin' shit like a marathon
Flyin' with the bag like a carry-on
I'm a fuckin' don like I'm Perignon
And I'm Megatron with this ak, and my autobots stay ready
I'm a nightmare, no Freddy, you don't really want smoke like Reggie
Feel this from what I've been through, God's strong and influential
I'll shorten up your circuit, don't make me disassemble
Body is the temple, fire in the church
I will take life from you pussies like you was givin' birth
Now all eyes on me like the stovetop
I'm a sex machine and bitches wanna do the robot
Thinkin' they gon' get in real good but don't know the doors locked
That's when I turn them bitches around, just like a road block
I never been the jealous type, that shit weak like 7 nights
Designer and a pair of Mike's, you ain't fly like you scared of heights
Turnin' down deals left and right, I'm shinin' bright as heavens light
There might not be a second life, that's why I count my blessings twice
They'd rather shoot instead of fight, that's why I clench my weapon tight
I'm blowin' first, I'll shoot the crap out em just like a pair of dice
Y'all ain't hit no nothin' like pitchers that's throwin' hella strikes
And I pray to the same God you do, that's who gave the devil life
Thank God a nigga finally made it off of his block
Don't beef with me cause I'm too smart, bitch I'm the ultimate opp
Like janitors walk with the mop, you keep on talkin', get popped
Caution, I'm hot off with his top, inside that coffin you'll rot
Bang!
:
Started off movin' grams, doin' it for my fam
Been in a couple jams, had to rearrange some plans
But it made me who I am (Yeah it made me who I am)
Yeah it made me who I am (Who I am, who I am)
Never asked for a hand
Didn't have too many friends
Tryna stay out that can
While I hustle for these bands
But it made me who I am (Who I am)
Yeah, it made me who I am
:
Yeah, straight from the ground like a push-up
I had to become a pusher
Like Master P, had the hook-up
A lot came with it but I never been shook up
Done been through it all
From jail, gettin' shot, almost dieing, but I knew to look up
God showed me the light through the cloud
The hate all around
But look what it took us
No daddy watchin' mama struggle too
Me hittin' them streets, had to hustle too
I'm feelin' like Meek, everything I use to be not what I was accustom to
And then came the beef, where we came with choppas Asserted like brothas do, they snitch in them streets
I promise 12 the only trouble we run into
Now we whippin' cases
So many thought we wouldn't make it
Even me sometimes I had to face it
We did it so quick like I was taken
But now I'm on my shit
All you hard readers can't get a cent
Aim so straight I can't miss
Be in my face, I don't know how to quit

But it made me who I am (Who I am)
Yeah, it made me who I am

Flown way to the top, just like heaven gates
Knew with God on my side, I would never break
Just a young nigga, straight outta section 8
Project buildin', livin' around hella snakes
Mama buyin' from dealers that's sellin' weight
Still had sister, never put me second place
Shit wasn't never sweet
Just so I could eat
Sometimes she went days when she never ate
Done seen so much struggle, I'm comin' with it
Not ashamed of my pain, motha fuck a critic
Our refrigerator had nothin' in it
Told myself "then I gotta go fuckin' get it"
I remember days it was cold nigga
Our thermostat was the stove nigga
Way before the rappin' I was poor nigga
I was who was sleepin' on the floor nigga
Niggas seen niggas changed money made em' do it
I know the struggle well, I'm no stranger to it
Middle finger to it
I could make it through it
If there is a heaven, I ain't racin' to it
Had to sit drugs up on my scale
Dependent on clientele
Done took way to many L's
Sat in counties with no bail
Doin' push-ups in my cell
Time passin' like a snail
Never told, I'll never tell
Held that water like a pail
Got up every time I fell
Niggas tried me they got nailed
Trigger happy like Pharrell
Nina singin' like Adele
Got away with murder twice, hope I don't get sent to hell
Thankful I ain't in no grave or up in somebody's jail
All my niggas trust my vision, told em' hold on like a rail
I ain't never led us wrong, like I don't know how to spell
I get paid for every thought, like a fuckin' wishin' well
This is Fire in The Church, coldest thing to drop since hail
:

Bitch, we really tote them toolies, just bought a uzi
Pop a opp just like a rufie, hangover goofies
Wet yo ass like a jacuzzi, get smoked like pooky
Concrete jungles where we hustle
They show love but they don't love you
I'm a dog, I need a muzzle
I done did more dirt than shovels
I done been in hella traps, I had to dig up out that tunnel
We bought guns to build our muscle, ain't no takin' from this puzzle
We kick doors to get our foot in, did things we shouldn't
Hustlin', strugglin', we was pullin', finessin', juggin'
I still rep the hood I stood in, disrespect, I'm trigger pullin'
With this ratchet, I'm bout action, no acting, no Cuba Goodin'
Pull that mac out, then I black out, let off this pain
I never been the type to tap out, heroine had my OG noddin', bout to pass out
No one, I really, really, lived up in the traphouse, couldn't pull no map out

Bitch, I'm ridin' with my goonies

Breakin' bread, Jesus, yeah
Diamond teeth, rubber band bar
Round table, Bread Winner subject
Big discussion with the other landlord
Sellin' tan, art my God, youngin' wiggin on the xan bar
'Bout to light a stick of cancer, got along with a dancer
Hustlin', I'm not retirin' man
Blowin' the loud, I get high everyday
Movin' in silence, try me
We open fire, just like a firing range
When the love gone, don't come around
(Gun noises), shells on the ground
Free my nigga Rule Boy Blacka
Prison cell, I pray you make it out
Lately, I've been prayin' on the loud
Never no respond to me at all
I am not afraid to be a muslim
Christian people look at me and frown
Fuck the haters, I'mma keep it pushin'
In my circle, they are not allowed
We on now, don't come around
Pay cuts, handshake and smile
But nothin' public, thuggin', crack a smile
I just flew another nigga but
Shorty say she love if I was dressin' bummy
Probably wouldn't wanna stand in front of me
I'm a shooter with a shooter
Bred to win, but born a loser
I done came to the conclusion
This is just a big illusion

I'm ridin' with my goonies
We all we got, came from the bottom with my goonies
Straight to the top, you know I'm climbin' with my goonies

Grindin' with my goonies
Shorty hit me up, she like "Tony pick me up"
She wanna lick me up, want me to beat that kitty up
Shorty thick as fuck, ass look like Nicki butt
She like her pussy ate, and she like her titties sucked
Don't ask me questions, uh-uh bitch this ain't no trivia
Cause I'll dub a bitch and I don't mean I'm 20 up
Was hustlin' in the trap, I used to bag that sticky up
Was moving ounces out that bitch just like a sippy cup
Pounds in garbage bags the bitches looked like missy uh
One thing about me had two bodies by age 21
These haters envious I love when they act really tough
Hit 'em with the pump it look like I shot Ricky up
I stay litty uh, saucy plus I'm drippy huh
You can't stick me up, bitch I keep the glizzy tucked
I'm Suge mixed with Pac, Diddy mixed with Biggie uh
I'm signed to myself, my net worth 8 milli uh
I do this for my fans, and for la familia
My daughter pretty uh, sweeter than Olivia
From the land of Larry Hoover nigga, keep a group of hittaz
Kill a opp while he fuckin' sleep I'm Freddy Krueger nigga
One shot'll lift him up and drop him like a Uber nigga
Cold blood I guess he poolin' nigga, family view a nigga
Told y'all I keep that iron close if he think I'm a joke
Air him out, like the dryer broke if he try to poke
Real nigga in this Gucci shit I made her coochie drip
I'm tatted up, like I'm Tunechi bitch made her leave who she with
She blew on me like I'm tookey bitch don't try no flukey shit
Cause this MC stay with the hammer but this bitch ain't too legit
Banana clips, when this uzi spit it ain't no fruity shit
Pop a opp, like a roofie quick kill all that goofy shit
Remember when, I was mad broke, before the cash flow
My OG, on and off that base, like an astro
Prayed to God for better days he gave me what I asked for
Rap God you see me goin' in, like a glass door
Every track I gotta spaz tho like it's my last tho
It's only snakes, in the grass so I cut the grass low
Niggas 12, acting like they mob, Donnie Brasco
Keep a stick, like a staff hoe go do the math hoe
Gun cases, tell 'em google that I always had pole
Couldn't wait to get it jumpin' like a fuckin tadpole
I'm just tryna be a dad tho don't be an asshole
Cause I'll switch back to my past, hoe, quick as Flash hoe
And if I pop up in that mask hoe, I'm on yo ass hoe
Glock 50's bitch we slash throats don't get yo ass smoked
Pick his top, like an afro then do the dash hoe
And if you hatin' bitch you better skate Lupe Fiasco

These haters envious I love when they act really tough
Hit 'em with the pump it look like I shot Ricky up
Go buy my album that bitch dropping on May 20th
Pray for the Devil and make sure you pray for Libya

They wanna be way  more then friends now
They say they wanna have my kids now
I swear they all up on my dick now
Hoping they get dick'd down

Was caught up in that street life
Hustling moving big loud
Had to kick out quick
Feel like the devil had me pinned down
Rap God I was sent down
Labels want to sit down
Mama got a big smile
My lyrics pay the rent now
I be setting trends now
Walk-throughs, I get 10 thou'
Remember window shopping
I got options when I spend now
Used to rock white tees
I got versace on my skin now
Bitches on my dick
They want to blow me like the wind now
I know them niggas pissed now
30 in my clip now
I swear I won't  miss, (pow)
Y'all families gon' miss y'all
Still got pistols hidden in every room inside my crib now
Knew I was gon' blow like a grenade, I pulled that pin out
All I do is win now
So I know what it is now
They figure since I'm poppin' I got money I can lend out
So that's that greed within y'all , Don't care if I offend y'all
Knowing y'all ain't real, but everyone wanna pretend now

Man ever since I made it big now
And I be dressing like I'm rich now
And hella bitches on my dick now
They wanna get dick'd down
They be with the shits now
They wanna be way more then friends now
They say they wanna have my kids now
I swear they all up on my dick now
Hoping they get dick'd down
They be with the shits now

Man, every time I drop some music
These bitches get shot by cupid
I'm not foolish, far from stupid
So miss me with all that fu shit
I can smell an opportunist
As strong as your perfume is
I see through the dark
I'm blessed with a light as bright as the moon is
Man as soon you start buzzing
Hoes crushing all of a sudden
Bunch of niggas showing love
With hopes they can fit in your budget
Out here acting like day ones
When they know that they really wasn't
But I'm out like a concussion
No question they ain't one hunnid'
Got deal with so much hate now
I gotta watch them snakes now
My struggles I embrace now
I'm too Godly to break down
Bitches think it's sweet
They wanna see how good it taste now
And even those who hate
Mention my name with all the greats now
I be getting dough now
Moncler when it's cold out
Giuseppe's  when he's stepping
Need a red carpet to roll out
Ain't have to sell my soul to be on top
And sell these shows out
I'm no fire truck but niggas know I bring the hose (hoes) out

And ever since I made it big now
And I be dressing like I'm rich now
And hella bitches on my dick now
They wanna get dick'd down
They be with the shits now
They wanna be way more then friends now
They say they wanna have my kids now
I swear they all up on my dick now
Hoping they get dick'd down

I thought you knew that I'm the man on me
Got all these bitches want dance on me
None of ‘em can’t wait to get their hands on me
And I’m so hard I got the opps turn into fans on me
Keep the tooly keep some bands on me
I’m never lackin’ I be damned on me
Brand new Glock that bitch won’t jam on me
And I’m so hard I got the opps turn into fans on me

From the bottom of the bottom is where I came from
Fought fire with fire nigga I had a flamer
I turn my hell into heaven yup I done came up
Had to kick disloyal subjects up out of my kingdom
Whether they hate me or not they still bring my name up
But I only rock with the ones who ain’t never change up
It’s kind of funny when haters start smellin’ money
Everybody want to hop all aboard like here the train come
Remember whippin’ through the town on me
A couple thou’ forty cal on me
I put food in mouths servin’ pounds on me
And niggas hate I graduated cap and gown on me
A bunch of jewelry bunch of tats on me
That ass was fat she threw it back on me
Her nigga mad cuz I got racks on me
But boy I come like overalls you know the straps on me


Forty on my hip again, thirty in my clip again
I feel like Diddy wit L.O.X. I’m about my Benjamin
Had to hustle in this concrete jungle we livin’ in
Been down before let the devil know I ain’t giving in
I put God first and he put me back on my shit again
These haters pissed again they throwing a fit again
But soon as I win again they back on my dick again
I’m making banks uncle Phil up in Vivian
No injury but lots of ice on me
Heard you wanna poke me like a knife on me
I hope you really bout that life on me
Cuz once I’m up you know I’m shootin’ like the dice on me
A bunch of haters wishing death on me
Don’t get a casket tryna flex on me
Cuz I’m a turn into to a ref on me
That tool eject up out this Tec that how he left on me
I get it crackin' like eggs I'm Yeshua back from the dead
I could turn any thought into bread
I'm no Christian but I got the Edge
It gets cold when I slide like a sled
When I do so no needle and thread
Bullets flippin' up better hit heads
Turn a coffin into your new bed
I'm hip hop's Stephen King of Westcraven
Gotta be on my paper no gradin'
Gotta bring 'em that message like ravens
Every struggle I went through was trainin'
Every loss there's a lesson I'm gainin'
Can't be scared to get wet when it's rainin'
We can't grow if we don't let the pain in
Don't make excuses and don't do no blamin'
Everyone thinks the truth's on the canvas
But only the creator could paint it
Bitch that means only God could explain it
Wanna meet him I'll make some arrangements
Niggas act like it's war that they cravin'
Until I come and do an invasion
If you real say that shit to my face
And not behind my back like an apron
When I see you don't do no explainin'
Make you eat every word you was sayin'
I just wanna see what you was thinkin'
So you already know how I'm aimin'
Point it at his head and then strike him down
Make his ass eat a light like he Raiden
Put a part in his top like it's braidin'
When that clip hit his top he ain't shavin'
I'm a boss, bitch I do what I choose to
Bitch I been turned like a loose screw
I don't sell drugs but I used to
I been the connect before bluetooth
I get top from your boo in a new coupe
I could rap I look good I could shoot too
I draw when it's sketchy plus my shooters ready
To pull that bitch out like a loose tooth
They gone edit don't care about who's who
Tell your kids they gon' cry when they lose you
Put they pa on the TV like Blue's Clues
Murder scene when we shootin', no news crew
Bunch of blood on his shirt that ain't prune juice
I just made his designer say suwoop
Now he need a casket and new suit
Wet him up in the morning like Fruit Loops
I got God up inside of me
Go tell the devil that I am the hottest commodity
Loyal to the Lord without a havin' a thought of a heaven
He didn't have to promise me
In my country my president's prejudice
Them devils do not believe in equality
Never compromisin' with poverty
Don't play games with your money, Monopoly
Get a check and invest in some property
Always leave with that steel like a robbery
Fuck everyone's feelings don't do sugarcoatin'
It ain't no substitute for honesty
Ever wonder if Jesus is scared
Or he got the balls to pop up like the lottery
And if God's so forgiving
Then would he be willing to accept the devil's apology
I know I'm a blessing I don't come in second
My flow is from heaven, my soul is protected
This rapper's gifted and what I'ma give to you is out of the box
Like you opening presents
Me and hip hop like Hulk Hogan and wrestling
Can't hustle too long, gotta know when to exit
Started off trappin' and turned it to rappin'
It's FGE, we the new No Limit Records
Got dough with my bros off the dope I was sellin'
Had hoes gettin' naked, got throat like a necklace
Some homies got jealous didn't know I was destined
Only Lord knows, with that pole I was reckless
We stopped what I'm doin' like hold up a second
No PlayStation game, I was loading that tech in
My opps caught them bullets with no interception
I shot the crap out 'em like rolling a seven
I got the key to the door
Remember when I used to sleep on the floor
No eskimo but I pack heat in my coat
It ain't no better feeling than bein' awoke
Acknowledging God is the reason I'm dope
Make 'em fiend for the flow that make demons get ghost
He ain't on my level so pray for the devil
For he is the sinner that needs it the most
Yeah
Cypher 7, you niggas know the fuckin' routine
Mob
Coming up I had it rough, yup every night I used to pray
I was tryna do it big, all a nigga had was faith
My bro in the cage, fightin' for us like no MMA
Free the real, when they come home it's a holiday
No it ain't no MILF, when this fuckin' .40 pop a pussy
I ain't drinking on no milk, but I smoke a lotta cookies
I just came in the game, ballin' on 'em like a rookie
Shorty see me shining, she blew on me like I fuck with Tookey
Money, drugs, and murder, I come from Peoria nigga
And I'm not Sean Livingston but I'm a warrior nigga
She thick and she bad as fuck, give me neck like I'm Dracula
Come through with this .50 spittin' it's gon' be a massacre
Clapping at you like a graduation once I cap 'em up
Smoke a nigga like a session I ain't even pass the blunt
Shooting at you like directors since you niggas acting tough
Now it's ambulances backing up with bags to pack you up
Ain't no question how I'm rocking we the fucking trending topic
If it's beef, CP3, how I'm shooting with the rockets
FGE, taking off, while you haters sitting watching
Hit his teeth, with the iron like I'm golfing, get a coffin bitch

FGE shit man, ha
'Tigue in this bitch
I been grinding, feel like Weezy, I got money on my mind
You know that I play to win, like it's money on the line
I'm not taking disrespect, all this shit gon' get correct
Know some niggas cut like chess get X'd and boxed you look connect
Watch me ball just like a scout, on anyone who gon' doubt
I know I'm gon' make it out, I make all my haters pout
Some of my niggas move pillows like they tryna fix the couch
Soon as they get that shit in, you know they gon' get it out
Tried to tell 'em we don't play, that's what's tried and they failed
Watch these niggas, they not real, they not built for this, they frail
Bring that bullshit, and we sprayin' tryna clear the smell
Y'all be the ones 12 that's singing like 112
Smart and cute with a nice body, not ball hogging couldn't pass it
She was wanted just like Angela Jolie I gotta have it
Used to fuck her lost connection now shit lagging guess shit happen
Beat that pussy up, we go pound for pound we not dapping, uh
Every beat I touch, I murder, I know the feelin
Fans know when I'm on beast, like O'Neal I shall kill
No sirens got a clear path headed to the top
Pussy nigga might foul but he know that free shot
Ball in this bitch no blender bottle
Gotta thick bitch gon' bend then swallow
I told bro we can't give up, I don't quit just like Apollo
Creed, I know I ain't perfect I'm a sinner like MB but
I still pray everyday, and not just for me

Yeah, Talley
FGE shit
Look, aye, going down they throat again
If they hate watch 'em swallow it hard
I'm gifted as a holiday card
These niggas sweeter than holiday heart
Bitch I been the truth, and gon' be either when I meet God
I don't speak watch the bodies I crop
But don't get put in that closet it's dark
So much shit follow my heart, had the heart in it
That's spending they worth won't get caught in it
I need everything blessed when I'm crossing it
So I searched for God's power and harnessed it
Faith boosting me up like a starter kit
Said your word was the sword so I sharpened it
Now my verse is so worth you could auction it
I collect with a blame, but literally
And fuck shit ain't safe if it's near to me
I'm down to die for who's dear to me
Hard for me to cry but it's tears in me
Theres no fear in me, for every fuck nigga hearing me
I drive with that steel like I'm Harry B
And I pop it like a pill in me
So full of rage, I cage it
Only God knows how amazing
Don't be a John Doe I'ma blaze him
He in church only Jesus could save him
I guess it's with the beat when I take him
Wanna play it ain't free I'm a gamer
Like 2K no 2 3 when I fade him
Put that lead in his sheets and erase him
Now back to that paper, aye
Like schooling nigga, and I been on my A game
I don't know where you been nigga
I go hard as the freight train, I get shit moving nigga
Don't think like I slang 'cain
How your bitch tryna move in nigga
And I stay fly as a crane, high as Mariah could sing
And I like my dollars the same
So you know I'ma grind to the grave
Go axe if I slide, if I bang
Bet my city won't lie on my name
Even though they know how I behave
They don't know we got bodies for days
Rahhh!

Pray For The Devil right on schedule they can't get me off his heels
Rap God bitch and yes I get paid for the flow no water bill
My shit been ill as coughing, still I'm on the road not off a pill
Don't even start I'll squeeze and spark Steven Seagal I'm hard to kill
I'm known to blow you all to chill get turned to fire Marshall Bill
Then you'll know what I talk was real, and how inside a coffin feel
And niggas know how I'm shooting, you don't want smoke like I'm Reggie
Let's keep it G, you don't want beef, you don't want me like a deli
I hope you ready when I slide up on your ass like a wedgie
Come out the cut no machete, this bitch gon' blow like it's Becky
I'm godly with the bars, like the lord was my celly
I'm 'bout my cake Little Debbie, these rappers know they ain't ready
They just my sons and right now I'm babying 'em like a belly
They say Montana got this bitch on lock but I ain't R. Kelly
Im cooler than Uncle Jessie, known to snap Fonzarelli
You see the drip like I'm sweaty, you wanna jacket no Pelle
I made it happen with music, pour some strings like a cello
If you want war then I'm gon' draw like Triple G and Canelo
I'm bringing heat like a kettle, yo ass is grass like a metal
You know my metal to put niggas in the dirt like a shovel
I'll take you there like a shuttle, and take your soul like a pedal
Came out the hood not the ghetto and he thought he seen the Devil
I shot him in both of his thighs and the knee like Carmelo
I had him shaking like Jell-o then took his top off, LaMelo
Squa!

Yeah, yeah
Ayo, Black, it's time, word (Word, it's time, man)
It's time, man (Aight, man, begin)
Yeah, straight out the fuckin' dungeons of rap
Where fake niggas don't make it back
I don't know how to start this shit, yo... now

Rappers, I monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm I be kickin'
Musician inflictin' composition of pain
I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine
Holdin' an M16, see with the pen I'm extreme – now
Bullet holes left in my peepholes, I'm suited up in street clothes
Hand me a 9 and I'll defeat foes
Y'all know my steelo, with or without the airplay
I keep some E&J, sittin' bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner bettin' Grants with the cee-lo champs
Laughin' at baseheads tryna sell some broken amps
G-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
Reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped
Niggas be runnin' through the block shootin'
Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston
Once they caught us off-guard, the MAC-10 was in the grass, and
I ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin
Picked the MAC up, told brothers "Back up!" — the MAC spit
Lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, I made him backflip
Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
Gave another squeeze, heard it click "Yo, my shit is stuck!"
Try to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger
Finally pulled it back and saw
Three bullets caught up in the chamber
So now I'm jettin' to the building lobby
And it was full of children, prob'ly couldn't see as high as I be
(So what you sayin'?) It's like the game ain't the same
Got younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name
And claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
In broad daylight, stick-up kids, they run up on us
45's and gauges, MAC's in fact
Same niggas will catch you back-to-back
Snatchin' your cracks in black
There was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked
So hold your stash 'til the coke price drop
I know this crackhead who said she got to smoke nice rock
And if it's good, she'll bring you customers in measuring pots
But yo, you gotta slide on a vacation
Inside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin'
It drops deep as it does in my breath
I never sleep—'cause sleep is the cousin of death
Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
I think of crime when I'm in a New York state of mind

New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

Be havin' dreams that I'm a gangsta
Drinkin' Moëts, holdin' TEC's
Makin' sure the cash came correct, then I stepped
Investments in stocks, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks
Winnin' gunfights with mega-cops
But just a nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
Give me a Smith & Wesson, I have niggas undressin'
Thinkin' of cash flow, buddha and shelter
Whenever frustrated, I'm a hijack Delta
In the PJ's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays
Young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze
Full of black rats trapped plus the Island is packed
From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back
Black, I'm livin' where the nights is jet-black
The fiends fight to get crack
I just max, I dream I can sit back
And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn
Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, holmes
I got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane
Life is parallel to Hell, but I must maintain
And be prosperous, though we live dangerous
Cops could just arrest me, blamin' us: we're held like hostages
It's only right that I was born to use mics
And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes
I've taken rappers to a new plateau
Through rap slow, my rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule
The smooth criminal on beat breaks
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
The city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps
That's where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks
I'm a addict for sneakers
20's of Buddha and bitches with beepers
In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya
Inhale deep like the words of my breath
I never sleep—'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I lay puzzle as I backtrack to earlier times
Nothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind

New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

"Nasty Nas—"
Fuck Jay Z!
(What's up, niggas?
Ayo, I know you ain't talkin' about me, dog
You? What?!)
Fuck Jay Z!
(You been on my dick, nigga
You love my style, nigga)
Fuck Jay Z!

(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you – the king – you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already

Brace yourself for the main event, y'all impatiently waitin'
It's like an AIDS test, what's the results? Not positive
Who's the best: Pac, Nas and B.I.G.? Ain't no best
East, West, North, South, flossed out, greedy
I embrace y'all with napalm
Blows up, no guts left, chest/face gone
How could Nas be garbage? Semi-autos at your cartilage
Burner at the side of your dome, come out of my throne!
I got this locked since 9-1, I am the truest
Name a rapper that I ain't influenced
Gave y'all chapters, but now I keep my eyes on the Judas
With Hawaiian Sophie fame, kept my name in his music

(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you – the king – you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already

Ayo, pass me the weed!
Put my ashes out on these niggas, man
Ayo, you faggots, y'all kneel
And kiss the motherfuckin' ring!

(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you – the king – you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already

I've been fucked over, left for dead, dissed and forgotten
Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone, stiff and rotten
Y'all just piss on me, shit on me, spit on my grave
Talk about me, laugh behind my back, but in my face
Y'all some well-wishers, friendly-acting, envy-hiding snakes
With your hands out for my money, man, how much can I take?
When these streets keep callin', heard it when I was sleep
That this Gay-Z and Cock-a-Fella Records wanted beef
Started cockin' up my weapon, slowly loadin' up this ammo
To explode it on a camel and his soldiers
I can handle this for dolo, and his manuscript just sound stupid
When KRS already made an album called Blueprint (dick!)
First Biggie's your man, then you got the nerve to say
That you better than B.I.G
Dick-suckin' lips, why don't you let the late great veteran live?

I… will… not… lose
God's son across the belly
I prove you lost already
The king is back, where my crown at?
Ill Will, rest in peace!
Let's do it, niggas!

(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you – the king – you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already

Y'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches
What's sad is I love you, ‘cause you're my brother
You traded your soul for riches
My child, I've watched you grow up to be famous
And now I smile like a proud dad watchin' his only son that made it
You seem to be only concerned with dissin' women
Were you abused as a child?
Scared to smile? They called you ugly?
Well, life is harsh, hug me, don't reject me
Or make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly
In '88 you was gettin' chased through your building
Callin' my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers
All I did was give you a style for you to run with
Smilin' in my face, glad to break bread with the God
Wearin' Jaz' chains, no TEC's, no cash, no cars
No jail bars, Jigga, no pies, no case
Just Hawaiian shirts, hangin' with little Chase
You a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a Stan
I still whip yo' ass, you 36 in a karate class?
You Tae-Bo ho, tryna work it out, you tryna get brolic?
Ask me if I'm tryna kick knowledge?
Nah, I'm tryna kick the shit you need to learn though
That ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow
Is he Dame Diddy, Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy?
Oh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy
Rocafella died of AIDS, that was the end of his chapter
And that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after?
Put it together: I rock hoes, y'all rock fellas
And now y'all try to take my spot, fellas
Feel these hot rocks, fellas, put you in a dry spot, fellas
In a pine box with nine shots from my Glock, fellas
Foxy got you hot ‘cause you kept your face in her puss
What you think, you gettin' girls now ‘cause of your looks?
Ne-gro, please! You no-mustache-havin'
With whiskers like a rat, compared to Beans you whack
And your man stabbed Un and made you take the blame
You ass, went from Jaz to hangin' with Kane
To Irv, to B.I.G. – and Eminem murdered you on your own shit
You a dick-ridin' faggot, you love the attention
Queens niggas run you niggas, ask Russell Simmons! Ha!
R-O-C get gunned up and clapped quick
J.J. Evans get gunned up and clapped quick
Your whole damn record label, gunned up and clapped quick
Shawn Carter to Jay-Z – damn, you on Jaz dick!
So little shorty's gettin' gunned up and clapped quick
How much of Biggie's rhymes is gonna come out your fat lips?
Wanted to be on every last one of my classics
You pop shit, apologize, nigga, just ask Kiss!
Ayo, what's up, what's up?
Let's keep it real, son, count this money
You know what I'm sayin'? Yeah, yeah
Ayo, put the Grants over there in the safe
You know what I'm sayin'?
‘Cause we spendin' these Jacksons
The Washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go
I'm sayin' that's what this is all about, right?
Clothes, bankrolls, and hoes
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, then what, man, what?!

Visualizin' the realism of life in actuality
Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary
And my mentality is money-orientated
I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
‘Cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as Five Percenters
But somethin' must've got in us, ‘cause all of us turned to sinners
Now some restin' in peace and some are sittin' in San Quentin
Others, such as myself, are tryin' to carry on tradition
Keepin' this Schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us
'Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
Even though we know, somehow we all gotta go
But as long as we leavin' thievin'
We'll be leavin' with some kind of dough
So, until that day we expire and turn to vapors
Me and my capers will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers
Keepin' it real, packin' steel, gettin' high
‘Cause life's a bitch and then you die

Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye

I woke up early on my born day; I'm 20, it's a blessin'
The essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh and
My physical frame is celebrated ‘cause I made it
One quarter through life, some godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual, plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I pus from
My skull, ‘cause it's pain in my brain vein, money maintain
Don't go against the grain, simple and plain
When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbin' foreigners, take they wallets, they jewels and rip they green cards
Dipped to the projects, flashin' my quick cash
And got my first piece of ass, smokin' blunts with hash
Now it's all about cash in abundance
Niggas I used to run with is rich or doin' years in the hundreds
I switched my motto; instead of sayin', "Fuck tomorrow!"
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Time is illmatic, keep static like wool fabric
Pack a 4-matic to crack your whole cabbage

Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die
(It's yours)
Whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?

I sip the Dom P, watchin' Gandhi 'til I'm charged, then
Writin' in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
Behold the mic I'm throbbin', mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facin'
Time like Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracin'
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
Suede Timbs on my feet makes my cipher complete
Whether cruisin' in a Six cab or Montero Jeep
I can't call it, the beats make me fallin' asleep
I keep fallin', but never fallin' six feet deep
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me

Whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?

To my man Ill Will
God bless your life
To my peoples throughout Queens
God bless your life
I trip, we box up crazy bitches
Aimin' guns in all my baby pictures
Beef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's
Yet I'm the mild, money-gettin' style, rollin' foul
The versatile, honey-stickin', wild, golden child
Dwellin' in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled
Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
There's no days for broke days
We sell it, smoke pays, while all the old folks pray
To Jesús, soakin' their sins in trays of holy water
Odds against Nas are slaughter
Thinkin' a word best describin' my life to name my daughter
My strength, my son, the star will be my resurrection
Born in correction, all the wrong shit I did
He'll lead a right direction
How you livin'? Large, a broker charge, cards are mediocre
You flippin' coke or playin' spit, spades, and strip poker?

(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
Yo, the world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
(It's yours)

Break it down
It's yours, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours

I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed
For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home
I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
‘Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Tryin' to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturin' my peeps not eatin' can make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up
Even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana, stabbin' women like the Phantom
The crew is lampin', Big Willie style
Check the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash loot in fly clothes, burnin' dollars to light my stoge
Walk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames
Plus the games people play bust the problems of the world today

(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
(It's yours)
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
(It's yours)
Yeah, the world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
(It's yours)

Yeah, a'ight?
To everybody in Queens, the foundation (It's yours!)
The world is yours
To everybody uptown, yo, the world is yours (It's yours!)
The world is yours
To everybody in Brooklyn
Y'all know the world is yours (It's yours!)
The world is yours
Everybody in Mount Vernon, the world is yours (It's yours!)
Long Island, the world is yours (It's yours!)
Staten Island, yeah, the world is yours (It's yours!)
South Bronx, the world is yours (It's yours!)
Aight
Fake thug, no love, you get the slug CB4 Gusto
Your luck low, I didn't know 'til I was drunk though
You freak niggas played out, get fucked and ate out
Prostitute turned bitch, I got the gauge out
Ninety-six ways I made out, Montana way
The Good-F-E-L-L-A, verbal AK spray
Dipped attache, jump out the Range, empty out the ashtray
A glass of 'ze, make a man Cassius Clay
Red dot plots, murder schemes, thirty-two shotguns
Regulate with my Dunns
Seventeen rocks gleam from one ring
They let me let y'all niggas know one thing
There's one life, one love, so there can only be one King
The highlights of livin', Vegas-style roll dice in linen
Antera spinnin' on Millenniums
Twenty G bets, I'm winnin' 'em; threats I'm sendin' 'em
Lex with TV sets the minimum
Ill sex adrenaline, party with villains
A case of Demi-Sec to chase the Henny
Wet any clique, with the semi TEC—who want it?
Diamonds, I flaunt it, chickenheads flock, I lace 'em
Fried broiled with basil, taste 'em
Crack the legs way out of formation
It's horizontal how I have 'em fuckin' me in the Benz wagon
Can it be Vanity from Last Dragon?
Grab your gun, it's on though
Shit is grimy, real niggas buck in broad daylight
With the broke MAC that won't spray right
Don't give a fuck who they hit as long as the drama's lit
Yo, overnight thugs bug ‘cause they ain't promised shit
Hungry-ass hooligans stay on that piranha shit

I never sleep, ‘cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
I never sleep, ‘cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
I never sleep, ‘cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
I never sleep, ‘cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'

I peeped you frontin', I was in the Jeep sunk in the seat
Tinted with heat, beats bumpin'
Across the street you was wildin'
Talkin' about how you ran the Island in '89
Layin' up, playin' the yard with crazy shine
I cocked the baby 9, that nigga gravy mine
Clanked him; what was he thinkin'
On my corner when it's pay-me time?
Dug 'em, you owe me, cousin
Somethin' told me "Plug him!"
So dumb, felt my leg burn, then it got numb
Spun around and shot one
Heard shots and dropped, son, caught a hot one
Somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come
Then they came askin' me my name
What the fuck? I got stitched up and went through
Left the hospital that same night, what
Got my gat back, time to backtrack
I had the drop, so how the fuck I get clapped?
Black was in the Jeep, watchin', all he seen speed by
Was a brown Datsun
And yo, nobody in my hood got one
That clown nigga's through, blazin' at his crew daily
The Bridge touched me up severely, hear me?
So when I rhyme it's sincerely yours
Be lightin' L's, sippin' Coors on all floors in project halls
Contemplatin' war niggas I was cool with before
We used to score together, Uptown coppin' the raw
But a thug changes and love changes
And best friends become strangers, word up

Y'all know my steelo
There ain't an army that could strike back
There ain't an army that could strike back
There ain't an army that could strike back
There ain't an army that could strike back

Thug niggas, yo, to them thug niggas
Gettin' it on in the world, you know?
To them niggas that's locked down
Doin' they thing, survivin', yaknowmsayin'?
To my thorough niggas, New York and worldwide
Yo, to the Queensbridge Militia
9-6 shit, The Firm clique
Illmatic, nigga, It Was Written though
It's been a long time comin'
Y'all fake niggas, tryin' to copy
Better come with the real though, fake-ass niggas, yo
(They throw us slugs, we throwin' them back, what)
Bring the shit, man! Live, man!
(Fuck that son, word up) 9-6 shit
It ain't hard to tell, I excel, then prevail
The mic is contacted, I attract clientele
My mic check is life or death, breathin' a sniper's breath
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like The Shining, sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket linin'
Hit the Earth like a comet—invasion!
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian: half-man, half-amazin'
‘Cause in my physical I can express through song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong
I drink Moët with Medusa, give her shotguns in Hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale; it ain't hard to tell

The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Not stories by Aesop
Place your loot up, parties I shoot up
Nas, I analyze, drop a jew-el, inhale from the L
School a fool well, you feel it like Braille
It ain't hard to tell, I kick a skill, like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills, I'm Ill plus Matic
I freak beats, slam it, like Iron Sheik
Jam like a TEC with correct techniques
So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me
Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me
I leave 'em froze, like heroin in your nose
Nas will rock well; it ain't hard to tell

This rhythmatic explosion
Is what your frame of mind has chosen
I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggas is frozen
Speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin
End like Leviathan, it's deep; well, let me try again
Wisdom be leakin' out my grapefruit, troop
I dominate break loops, givin' mics men-e-strual cycles
Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle
And groove even smoother than moves by Villanova
You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra
Packin' like a Rasta in the weed spot
Vocals will squeeze Glocks
MCs eavesdrop, though they need not to sneak
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas' raps should be locked in a cell; it ain't hard to tell
What up, kid? I know shit is rough doin' your bid
When the cops came you shoulda slid to my crib
Fuck it, black, no time for lookin' back, it's done
Plus, congratulations, you know you got a son
I heard he looks like ya, why don't your lady write ya?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flippin', talkin' about he acts too rough
He didn't listen, he be riffin' while I'm tellin' him stuff
I was like, "Yeah," shorty don't care, she a snake too
Fuckin' with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach
It's bugged, plus little Rob is sellin' drugs on the dime
Hangin' out with young thugs that all carry 9's
And night time is more trife than ever
What up with Cormega? Did you see him? Are y'all together?
If so, then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
You was my nigga when push came to shove
(One what?) One love!

One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Out in New York the same shit is goin' on
The crackheads stalkin', loudmouths is talkin'
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walkin'
That nigga you shot last year tried to appear
Like he hurtin' somethin'
Word to mother, I heard him frontin'
And he be pumpin' on your block
Your man gave him your Glock
And now they run together — what up, son? Whatever
Since I'm on the streets I'ma put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
Wildin' on the Island, but now in Elmira
Better chill, ‘cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain, when you come home the corner's ours
On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next V-I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
Your brother's buckwildin' in 4-Main, he wrote me
He might beat his case, 'til he come home I'll play it lowkey
So stay civilized, time flies
Though incarcerated your mind dies
I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda makes me want to murder, for reala
I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs, but one love

One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Mind's in another world, thinkin'
"How can we exist through the facts?"
Written in school text books, bibles, et cetera
Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost from my projects
I take my pen and pad for the weekend
Hittin' L's while I'm sleepin'
A two-day stay, you may say I need the time alone
To relax my dome, no phone, left the 9 at home
You see the streets had me stressed somethin' terrible
Fuckin' with the corners have a nigga up in Bellevue
Or HDM, hit with numbers from 8 to 10
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home, nobody's out but Shorty Doo-Wop
Rollin' two phillies together: in the Bridge we call 'em oo-wops
He said: "Nas, niggas caught me bustin' off the roof
So I wear a bulletproof and pack a black tre-deuce."
He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep
Started coughin', one eye peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like The Mack, my army suit was black
We was chillin' on these benches
Where he pumped his loose cracks
I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted and starts talkin' mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him
‘Cause when the pistol blows
The one that's murdered be the cool one
Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up
Coulda caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed, never bust up
At the crowd, catch him solo, make the right man bleed
Shorty's laugh was cold-blooded as he spoke so foul
Only twelve, tryin' to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wipin' the blunt's ash from my clothes
Then froze, only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man I'ma ghost, I broze
Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas: try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for Jake, Shorty Wop, one love

One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

To all my niggas locked up
From Queensbridge and all over
To my man , one love
To my man , one love
To my man , one love
Can't forget my motherfuckin' heart, Big , one love
To , yeah, one love
Life, I wonder
Will it take me under?
I don't know

Imagine smoking weed in the streets without cops harassin'
Imagine going to court with no trial
Lifestyle cruising blue Bahama waters, no welfare supporters
More conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot my son got knocked, evidently
It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Trooping out of state for a plate of knowledge
If coke was cooked without the garbage
We'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashin', fashion, designer clothes
Lacing your clique up with diamond Roles
Your people holding dough, no parole, no rubbers
Go in raw, imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time
Watch the blimp read "The World Is Mine"

If I ruled the world (imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

The way to be, paradise like relaxin'
Black, Latino and Anglo-Saxon
Armani Exchange deranged
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last
Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in the iller path
The Villa house is for the crew, how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better livin', type of place to raise kids in
Open they eyes to the lies history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seeing things like I was controllin', click rollin'
Tricking six digits on kicks and still holdin'
Trips to Paris, I civilized every savage
Give me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoner set free, stress free
No work release, purple M3's and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I make Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities
And reverse fiends to Willies
It sounds foul, but every girl I meet'd go downtown
I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa

If I ruled the world (imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

And then we'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land

You'd love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Duck down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Running from Jake, getting chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks, many mistakes go down out of state
Wait, I had to let it marinate, we carry weight
Trying to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer
Making moves in Atlanta, back-and-forth scrambler
‘Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still nobody want a nigga having shit
If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit
I push a Q-45 Infinit(i)
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies or B Felonies
Strictly living longevity to the destiny
I thought I'd never see, but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck?

If I ruled the world (imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)
If I ruled the world, if I ruled, if I ruled (imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, if I ruled, if I ruled
I love 'em love 'em baby
Black diamonds and pearls, black diamonds, black diamonds
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

If I ruled the world, if I ruled
If I ruled, I'd free all my sons
Black diamonds, I love 'em love 'em baby
Black diamonds and pearls, if I ruled
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
I love 'em love 'em baby!!
Check it out
I call it, yeah, yeah

For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters

I saw my daughter send a letter to some boy her age
Who locked up, first I regretted it, then caught my rage
Like, how could I not protect her from this awful phase?
Never tried to hide who I was, she was taught and raised
Like a princess, but while I'm on stage I can't leave her defenseless
Plus she's seen me switchin' women, Pops was on some pimp shit
She heard stories of her daddy thuggin'
So if her husband is a gangster, can't be mad, I'll love him
Never, for her I want better, homie in jail – dead that
Wait 'til he come home, you can see where his head's at
Niggas got game, they be tryna live
He seen your Mama crib, plus I'm sure he know who your father is
Although you real, plus a honest kid
Don't think I'm slow, I know you probably had that chronic lit
You seventeen, I got a problem with it
She looked at me like I'm not the cleanest father figure
But she rockin' with it

For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important

This morning I got a call, nearly split my wig
This social network said: "Nas, go and get your kid!"
She's on Twitter, I know she ain't gon' post no pic
Of herself underdressed – no inappropriate shit, right?
Her mother cried when she answered
Said she don't know what got inside this child's mind, she planted
A box of condoms on her dresser, then she Instagram'd it
At this point I realized I ain't the strictest parent
I'm too loose, I'm too cool with her
Should've drove more time to school with her
I thought I dropped enough jewels on her
Took her from private school, so she can get a balance
To public school, they're too nurture teen talents
They grow fast, one day she's your little princess
Next day she's talkin' boy business – what is this?
They say the coolest playas and foulest heart breakers in the world
God gets us back, he makes us have precious little girls

For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important

And I ain't tryin' to mess your thing up
But I just wanna see you dream up
I finally understand
It ain't easy to raise a girl as a single man
Nah, the way mothers feel for they sons
How fathers feel for they daughters
When he date, he straight, chip off his own papa
When she date, we wait behind the door with a sawed-off
‘Cause we think no one is good enough for our daughters
Love
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent

Straight up, shit is real
And any day could be your last in the jungle
Get murdered on a humble, guns'll blast, niggas tumble
The corners is the hot spot, full of mad criminals
Who don't care, guzzling beers, we all stare
At the out-of-towners
(Ay, yo, yo, who that?), they better break North
Before we get the four pounders and take their face off
The streets is filled with undercovers
Homicide chasing brothers
The D's on the roof tryin' to watch us and knock us
And killer coppers even come through in helicopters
I drink a little vodka, spark a L and hold a Glock
For the fronters, wannabe ill niggas and spot runners
Thinking it can't happen 'til I trap 'em and clap 'em
And leave 'em done, won't even run about gods
I don't believe in none of that shit, your facts are backwards
Nas is a rebel of the street corner
Pulling a TEC out the dresser; police got me under pressure

Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent

Yo, they call me Nas, I'm not your legal type of fella
Moët drinking, marijuana smoking street dweller
Who's always on the corner, rolling up blessed
When I dress, it's never nothing less than Guess
Cold be walking with a bop and my hat turned back
Love committing sins and my friends sell crack
This nigga raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue
The school drop-out, never liked the shit from day one
‘Cause life ain't shit but stress, fake niggas, and crab stunts
So I guzzle my Hennessy while pulling on mad blunts
The brutalizer, crew de-sizer, accelerator
The type of nigga who be pissing in your elevator
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game
Used to sport Bally's and Cazals with black frames
Now I'm into fat chains, sex and TECs
Fly new chicks and new kicks, Heines and Beck's

Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent

No doubt, see my stacks are fat, this is what it's about
Before the BDP conflict with MC Shan
Around the time when Shante dissed the Real Roxanne
I used to wake up every morning, see my crew on the block
Every day's a different plan that had us running from cops
If it wasn't hanging out in front of cocaine spots
We was at the candy factory, breaking the locks
Nowadays, I need the green in a flash just like the next man
Fuck a yard, God, let me see a hundred grand
Could use a gun, son, but fuck being the wanted man
But if I hit rock bottom then I'ma be the Son of Sam
Then call the crew to get live too, with Swoop
Bokeem, my brother Jungle, Big Bo cooks up the blow
Mike'll chop it; Mayo, you count the profit
My shit is on the streets, this way the Jakes'll never stop it
It's your brain on drugs, to all fly bitches and thugs
'Nuff respect to the projects, I'm ghost, one love

Represent y'all, represent
Represent y'all, represent
Represent y'all, represent
Represent y'all, represent

One time for your mothafuckin' mind
This goes out to everybody in New York
That's living the real fucking life and every projects, all over
To my man Big Will, he's still here
The 40 side of Vernon, my man Big L.E.S
Big Cee-Lo from the Don, Shawn Penn, the 40 busters
My crew the shorty busters, the 41st side of Vernon posse
The Goodfellas, my man Cormega, Lakey the Kid
Can't forget Draws, the Hillbillies
My man Slate, Wallethead, Black Jay, Big Oogie
Crazy barrio spot, (Big Dove), we rock shit a lot, Ph. D
And my man Primo, from Gang Starr
'94 real shit y'all (word up Harry O)
Fuck y'all crab-ass niggas though!

Bitch ass niggas! Bitch ass niggas!
Young bitch ass motherfuckers!
Come to Queensbridge, motherfucker!
Yeah, yeah, let's bring it back
That's just a warm up
‘Cause I can– on anybody, anybody
Where is he, the man who was just like me?
I heard he was hidin' somewhere I can’t see
Where is he, the man who was just like me?
Heard he was hidin' somewhere I can’t see
And I’m alone, and I realize that when I get home
I wanna talk to my red and my cherry
Yes, I’m alone, and I realize when I get home
I wanna talk to my red and my cherry

I want someone who like the champagne I like, my a-alike
Someone to talk me off the bridge any day or night
She teach me how to live, she ain’t afraid of life
Not easily impressed with the rich and famous life
'Cause she done been there and heard all the rumors before
She loves art, she ride out with me on my music tour
She like the herb's natural medicine, she cookin' good
She tell me everything is cool when it ain't lookin' good
For real, the world so ill, yo I want a girl so real
Who not after material wealth but get dough still
Or maybe an educator, a lady with etiquette
Who can be from out the hood or even work for the president
As long as there’s no selfishness
Yes, as long as her love for the people is deep-rooted and evident
You can be easily recruited, you’re heaven-sent
Your smile put me at ease
You’re the woman I need, but where is she?

Where is he, the man who was just like me?
I heard he was hidin' somewhere I can’t see
Where is he, the man who was just like me?
Heard he was hidin' somewhere I can’t see
And I’m alone, and I realize that when I get home
I wanna talk to my red and my cherry
Yes, I’m alone, and I realize when I get home
I wanna talk to my red and my cherry

I hate when people write me hostile texts
On account of my lifestyle’s perception
Invade my personal life out of the question
What are they expectin'? I be tryin' to reply and
They never suppose I get my quiet time in?
They think forever I’m rollin' in dough, swimmin' in a pool of cash
God, wouldn’t they know or am I a fool or ass?
I’m well known, got people comin' at me mad
I had to tell homes, I don’t keep a cell phone, my bad
I drag off the L and try to silence it
The noise in my head, the curse of the talented
Strong communicator, vagabond
I’d gallivant around the equator, if that would get me off the radar
It’s so intense, I’m on my Lilo & Stitch
Pour my Pinot Grigio and Cris with some lime, what is this?
An immaculate version of "Me & My Bitch" by Biggie
With all respect 'cause you the only one that gets me

Where is he, the man who was just like me?
I heard he was hidin' somewhere I can’t see
Where is he, the man who was just like me?
Heard he was hidin' somewhere I can’t see
And I’m alone, and I realize that when I get home
I wanna talk to my red and my cherry
Yes, I’m alone, and I realize when I get home
I wanna talk to my red and my cherry

Yeah, yeah, let’s pour some cherry wine
Everything’s good, everything’s fine
Yeah, yeah, we bring it every time
Yeah, pour a little cherry wine
Yeah, hey yo, Salaam
Yeah, I think they know the time
Everything’s good, everything’s fine
Yeah, pour a little cherry wine, yeah
Life is good, life is good, yeah
Life is good, no matter what, life is good
Life is good, life is good, yeah
No matter what, life is good

Where is he, the man who was just like me?
I heard he was hidin' somewhere I can’t see
Where is he, the man who was just like me?
Heard he was hidin' somewhere I can’t see
And I’m alone, and I realize that when I get home
I wanna talk to my red and my cherry
Yes, I’m alone, and I realize when I get home
I wanna talk to my red and my cherry
Umm, Premo, Nas
Yeah, yeah, yo
("Nas is...", "Nas is..."
"Nas is...", "Nas is..."
"Nas is...", "Nas is...", "Nas is...")

Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's being born
Same time a man is murdered—the beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural I explain
My plateau, and also, what defines my name
First it was Nasty, but times have changed
Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my sign is for pain
I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
Saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine
Saw my close friends shot, flatline, am I sane?
That depends, carry MAC-10's to practice my aim
On rooftops, tape CD covers to trees
Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
Street scriptures for lost souls, in the crossroads
To the corner thugs hustling for cars that cost dough
To the big dogs living large, taking in light
Pushing big toys, getting nice, enjoying your life
It's what you make it, suicide, few try to take it
Belt tied around their neck in jail cells naked
Heaven and Hell, rap legend, presence is felt
And of course N-A-S are the letters that spell - NAS, NAS

"Nas is like.. life or death.. I'm a rebel.. "
"My poetry's deep, I never fell.."
"Nas is like.. half-man, half-amazing.."
"No doubt.."
"Nas is like.. life or death.. I'm a rebel.. "
"My poetry's deep, I never fell.."
"Nas is like.. half-man, half-amazing.."
"No doubt.."

"Nas is like…" Earth, Wind & Fire, rims and tires
Bulletproof glass, inside is the realest driver
Planets in orbit, line 'em up with the stars
Tarot cards, you can see the pharaoh Nas
"Nas is like…" Iron Mike, messiah type
Before the Christ, after the death
The last one left, let my cash invest in stock
Came a long way from blasting TEC's on blocks
Went from Seiko to Rolex, owning acres
From the projects with no chips, to large cake dough
Dimes giving fellatio, siete zeros
Bet my 9 spit for the pesos,but what's it all worth?
Can't take it with you under this earth
Rich men died and tried, but none of it worked
They just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid
Before my number's called, history's made
Some'll fall, but I rise, thug or die
Making choices that determine my future under the sky
To rob, steal or kill, I'm wondering why
It's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?
Much success to you, even if you wish me the opposite
Sooner or later we'll all see who the prophet is

"Nas is like.. life or death.. I'm a rebel.. "
"My poetry's deep, I never fell.."
"Nas is like.. half-man, half-amazing.."
"No doubt.."
"Nas is like.. life or death.. I'm a rebel.. "
"My poetry's deep, I never fell.."
"Nas is like.. half-man, half-amazing.."
"No doubt.."

"Nas is like…" Sex to a nympho, but nothing sweet
I'm like beef, busting heat through your windows
I'm like a street sweeper, green leaf breather
Like Greeks in Egypt, learning something deep from they teachers
I'm like crime, like your 9, your man you would die for
Always got you, I’m like pop dukes you would cry for
I'm like a whole lot of loot, I'm like crisp money
Corporate accounts from a rich company
I'm like ecstasy for ladies, I'm like all races
Combined in one man; like the '99 Summer Jam
Bulletproof Hummer man
I'm like being locked down around new faces, and none of 'em fam
I'm the feeling of a millionaire spending a hundred grand
I'm a poor man's dream, a thug poet
Live it and I write down and I watch it blow up
Y'all know what I'm like, y'all play it your system every night, now…

"Nas is like.. life or death.. I'm a rebel.. "
"My poetry's deep, I never fell.."
"Nas is like.. half-man, half-amazing.."
"No doubt.."
"Nas is like.. life or death.. I'm a rebel.. "
"My poetry's deep, I never fell.."
"Nas is like.. half-man, half-amazing.."
"No doubt.." "Nas is like.."
One time..
Yeah..
Yeah..

All I need is one mic
One beat, one stage, one nigga front
My face on the front page, only if I
Had one gun, one girl and one crib
One God to show me how to do things his son did, pure
Like a cup of virgin blood, mixed with
151, one sip'll make a nigga flip
Writin' names on my hollow tips, plottin' shit
Mad violence, who I'm gon' body? This hood politics
Acknowledge it, leave bodies chopped up in garbages
Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us
Police watch us {*siren*}, roll up and try knockin' us
One knee I ducked, could it be my time is up?
But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again
Bus stop glass bursts, a fiend drops his Heineken
Ricochetin' between the spots that I'm hidin' in
Blackin' out as I shoot back – fuck gettin' hit! {*more sirens*}
This is my hood, I'ma rep to the death of it
'Til everybody come home, little niggas is grown
Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb, we need more warriors soon
Sent from the stars, sun and the moon
In this life of police chases, street sweepers and coppers
Stick-up kids with no conscience, leavin' victims with doctors
IF YOU REALLY THINK YOU READY TO DIE, WITH 9s OUT
THIS IS WHAT NAS IS 'BOUT, NIGGA, THE TIME IS NOW!

Yo, all I need is one mic..
All I need is one mic..
(That's all I need)
All I need is one mic..
(All I need niggas)
All I need is one mic..
(Yeah)

All I need is
One blunt, one page and one pen, one prayer
Tell God forgive me for one sin
Matter of fact, maybe more than one, look back
At all the hatred against me – fuck all of them!
Jesus died at age 33, there's 33 shots
From twin Glocks, there's 16 apiece, that's 32
Which means one of my guns was holdin' 17
27 hit your crew, six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime, hope your funeral
Never gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent
Nothin' is fair, niggas roll up, shootin' from wheelchairs
My heart is racin', tastin' revenge in the air
I let this shit slide for too many years, too many times
Now I'm strapped with a couple of MACs, too many 9s
If y'all niggas really with me, get busy, load up the semis
Do more than just hold it, explode the clip until you empty
There's nothin' in our way: they bust, we bust, they rush
We rush, lead flyin', feel it? I feel it in my gut
THAT WE TAKE THESE BITCHES TO WAR, LIE 'EM DOWN
CAUSE WE STRONGER NOW, MY NIGGA, THE TIME IS NOW!

All I need is one mic..
(That's all I need niggas, that's all I need)
All I need is one mic..
(There's nuttin else in the world)
All I need is one mic..
(That's all a nigga need to do his thing y'know)
All I need is one mic..
(This is all I need...)

ALL I NEED IS ONE LIFE, ONE TRY, ONE BREATH, I'M ONE MAN
WHAT I STAND FOR SPEAKS FOR ITSELF, THEY DON'T UNDER-
-STAND, don't wanna see me on top, too egotistical
Talkin' all that slick shit the same way these bitches do
Wonder what my secrets is, niggas'll move on you
Only if they know what your weakness is, I have none
Too late to grab guns, I'm blastin' ‘cause I'm a cool nigga
Thought I wouldn't have that ass done? Fooled you niggas
What you call an infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin'
War gets deep, some beef is everlastin'
Complete with thick scars, brothers knifin' each other up in
Prison yards, drama, where does it start?
You know the block was ill as a youngster, every night it was like a
Cop'll get killed, body found in the dumpster
For real a hustler, purchased my Range, niggas throwin' dirt on my name
Jealous ‘cause fiends got they work and complain
Bitches left me ‘cause they thought I was finished, shoulda knew she wasn't
True, she came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blindin', I never make the same mistakes, movin' with a
Change of pace, lighter load, see now the king is straight
Swellin' my melon, ‘cause none of these niggas real
Heard they were tellin' police, how can a kingpin squeal?
This is crazy, I'm on the right track, I'm finally found
You need some soul-searchin', the time is now

All I need is one mic..
(Yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
All I need is one mic..
(That's all I ever needed in this world, fuck cash)
All I need is one mic..
(Fuck the cars, the jewelry)
All I need is one mic..
(To spread my voice to the whole world, baby, uh)
Aight, fuck that shit! Word, word
Fuck that other shit, y'know what I'm sayin'?
We gonna do a lil somethin' like this
Y'know what I'm sayin'?
(Y'all doing that other shit)
Keep it on and on and on and on and
Know'm sayin'? Big Nas, Grand Wizard, what is it?
(It's like…) Haha, you know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, go ahead and rip that shit, dun!

I rap for listeners, bluntheads, fly ladies, and prisoners
Hennessy-holders and old-school niggas, then I be dissin' a
Unofficial that smoke Woolie Thai
I dropped out of Cooley High, gassed up by a cokehead cutie pie
Jungle survivor, fuck who's the live-er
My man put the battery in my back, a difference from Energizer
Sentence begins indented with formality
My duration's infinite, moneywise or physiology
Poetry, that's a part of me, retardedly bop
I drop the ancient manifested hip-hop straight off the block
I reminisce on park jams, my man was shot for his sheep coat
Choco blunts'll make me see him drop in my weed smoke
It's real, grew up in trife life, the times of white lines
The high pipes, murderous night times
And knife fights invite crimes
Chill on the block with Cognac, hold strap
With my peeps that's into drug money market interact
No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler
I guess that means peace
For niggas, no sheisty vice to just snipe ya
Start off the dice-rollin' mats for craps to cee-lo
With side-bets, I roll a deuce, nothin' below
(Peace God!) Peace God – now the shit is explained
I'm takin' niggas on a trip straight through memory lane
It's like that, y'all…

"Now let me take a trip down memory lane"
"Comin' outta Queensbridge"
"Now let me take a trip down memory lane"
"Comin' outta Queensbridge"
"Now let me take a trip down memory lane"
"Comin' outta Queensbridge"
"Now let me take a trip down memory lane"
"Comin' outta Queensbridge"

One for the money, two for pussy and foreign cars
Three for Alizé, niggas deceased or behind bars
I rap divine, God, check the prognosis: is it real or showbiz?
My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses
Live amongst no roses, only the drama
For real, a nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja
Here's my basis, my razor embraces, many faces
You're telephone blown, black, stitches or fat shoelaces
Peoples are petro, dramatic automatic .44 I let blow
And back down po-po when I'm vexed so
My pen taps the paper, then my brain's blank
I see dark streets, hustlin' brothers who keep the same rank
Pumpin' for somethin', some'll prosper, some fail
Judges hangin' niggas, uncorrect bails for direct sales
My intellect prevails from a hangin' cross with nails
I'll reinforce the frail with lyrics that's real
Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats
I decipher prophecies through a mic and say "peace"
I hung around the older crews while they sling smack to dingbats
They spoke of Fat Cat; that nigga's name made bell rings, black
Some fiends scream about Supreme Team, a Jamaica Queens thing
Uptown was Alpo, son, heard he was kingpin
Yo, fuck, rap is real! Watch the herbs stand still
Never talkin' to snakes, ‘cause the words of man kill
True in the game, as long as blood is blue in my veins
I pour my Heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane

"Now let me take a trip down memory lane"
"Comin' outta Queensbridge"
"Now let me take a trip down memory lane"
"Comin' outta Queensbridge"

"Comin' out of Queensbridge"
"Comin' out of Queensbridge"
"Comin' out of Queensbridge"
"Comin' out of Queensbridge"
"The most dangerous MC is…"
"Comin' out of Queensbridge"
"The most dangerous MC is…"
"Comin' out of Queensbridge"
"The most dangerous MC is…"
"Comin' out of Queensbridge"
"The most dangerous MC is…"
"Me number one, and you know where me from"
(Right… Right…)
Check me out y'all
Nasty Nas in your area
About to cause mass hysteria

Before a blunt, I take out my fronts
Then I start to front, matter of fact I be on a manhunt
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
That's like Malcolm X catchin' the Jungle Fever
King poetic, too much flavor, I'm major
Atlanta ain't Brave-r, I'll pull a number like a pager
‘Cause I'm an ace when I face the bass
40-side is the place that is givin' me grace
Now wait, another dose and you might be dead
And I'm a Nike-head, I wear chains that excite the feds
And ain't a damn thing gonna change, I'm a performer, strange
So the mic warmer was born to gain
Nas, why did you do it?
You know you got the mad-phat fluid when you rhyme
It's halftime

(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) Ayo it's halftime
(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) Yeah, it's about halftime
This is how it feel, check it out, how it feel

It's like that, you know it's like that
I got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back
When I attack, there ain't a army that could strike back
So I react never calmly on a hype track
I set it off with my own rhyme
‘Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
I'm max like cassettes, I flex like sex
In your stereo sets, Nas'll catch wreck
I used to hustle, now all I do is relax and strive
When I was young I was a fan of the Jackson 5
I drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it
With more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach
Nasty Nas has to rise ‘cause I'm wise
This is exercise 'til the microphone dies
Back in '83 I was an MC sparkin'
But I was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and
Kick my little raps ‘cause I thought niggas wouldn't understand
And now in every jam I'm the fuckin' man
I rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships
I used to watch "CHiPs", now I load Glock clips
I got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic
Versatile, my style switches like a faggot
But not bisexual, I'm an intellectual
Of rap I'm a professional, and that's no question yo
These are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand?
‘Cause in the streets I'm well-known like the number man
Am I in place with the bass and format?
Explore rap and tell me, "Nas ain't all that."
And next time I rhyme, I be foul
Whenever I freestyle I see trial, niggas say I'm wild
I hate a rhyme-biter's rhyme
Stay tuned, I assume, the real rap comes at halftime

(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) Exhale, check it, it's halftime
(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) It's real in the field
Word life, check it

I got it goin' on, even flip a morning song
Every afternoon, I kick half the tune
And in the darkness I'm heartless like when the NARC's hit
Word to Marcus Garvey, I hardly sparked it
‘Cause when I blast the herb, that's my word
I be slayin' them fast, doin' this that and the third
But chill, pass the Andre, and let's slay
I bag bitches up at John Jay and hit a matinee
Puttin' hits on 5-0
‘Cause when it's my time to go, I wait for God with the .44
And biters can't come near
And yo, go to hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia
I won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed
That's extra Phillie change, more cash for damp weed
This goes out to Manhattan, the island of Staten
Brooklyn and Queens is livin' fat and
The Boogie Down, enough props, enough clout
Ill Will, rest in peace, yo I'm out

(Right…) It's still halftime
(Right…) To the Queensbridge crew
To the Queensbridge crew, you know it's halftime
(Right…) Ninety-two, it's halftime
(Right…) Yo police, police man, yo let's get ghost
Halftime…
Freedom or jail, clips inserted
A baby's being born same time a man is murdered
The beginning and end, as far as rap goes
It's only natural, I explain my plateau
And also what defines my name

Yeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor now let the story begin

I ain't mad at you, young king, this unsung song is haunting
Along comes a one son called a offspring
The Earth spins, my Old Earth grin, sung a church hymn
She birthed in September, took my first wind, again, the Earth spins
I jumped in my first Benz, fled out, lead out
Screams got in the game and took bread out
The nerve of these niggas, weak flow, yo Cole let's murder this sequel
Freedom or jail from Fayetteville to QB though
Cause back when I was young there was massive niggas
But I passed them niggas, just being nasty nigga
Military hat, fatigue pants sagging, Henny'd up
Execs asking will he live to see his own release date happen
Straight off the corner with the armor, arm and hammer
But I had a appeal, I was a charmer
Yet still being my mama's son was my biggest honor
This shit was just kinda just a hobby in my project lobby
We was trying to be the Queensbridge Cosby's
But the street life robbed me of that, so I had to put it in raps
And who could I ask for help? Older niggas was getting mad
But that's the gift and the curse, that's the good and the bad
At least you got Jay, but he already one of the greats
And it's hard for the great to tell somebody how to be great
Nigga I tried and niggas threw that shit right back in my face
They took my cosign, but they ain't let me EP their tapes
And when they joint tanked, that's when they point blame
So point blank, young Cole, you won't be the same
The first album freedoms and them fourth album pressures
A big difference between 'em but I get why you said it
Radio records are needed, I just wanted it to bring the warning
Global warming to that cold world you was breathing
That's some advice I never got
If I don't sell another record, I'll just steady rock
While you was writing down my rhymes I was just tryna show you
That if you say what's on ya mind, you can stand the test of time
Now I'm playing Born Sinner loud, saw you live, rock the crowd
Like wow, you made your nigga Nas proud

So you ain't let Nas down
It's just part of the game, becoming a rap king, my nigga
You ain't let Nas down
How that sound? Here the crown, pass it to you like nothing, nigga
You ain't let Nas down

Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Slick Rick was like Jesus, G Rap wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
Large Professor's my mentor, that's how the story end
He's the heartbeat of the people
The ghetto people, and when I say ghetto people
The people who cannot afford to go to big concert
Some of these people do not even have TV, so they can't afford cable
Some of them can afford a radio
So the only thing they can listen to is the music
People the ghetto, people from the projects, street people
Hortical ghetto youth who know what it is to sing about suffering and reality

New York girl, dem a mad over we
New York girl, dem a mad over we
New York girl, dem a mad over we
New York girl, dem a mad over we

Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don
Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don, dance
Inna New York City-city, New York City-city (YEAH!)
(YEAH!) New York City-city, New York City-city

Smoking a escubano, guzzle my second bottle
Hope I don't catch a homo
Grossing our net, simultaneously making me climb higher
Heinous crimes behind me, search but can't find me, fuck sadness
Had this been you having this lavish
Habitual happiness at me you wouldn’t look backwards
You would have sex on condominium roof decks
So anyone move next, I'll hit you with two TECs
Rocking Roberto Cavalli, no shirt on, convertible Mazi
My Colombiana mommy riding beside me
Every tat mean something, that’s my word on my body
I’ll have to lean something with that Mossberg shotty
My niggas is ignant, put lead in your pigment
Just cause y'all was mad at all the years I was getting it
In '97 the six, '98 the Bentley
Now it’s the Ghost Phantom, and y'all can't stand him but

Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don
Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don, dance
Inna New York City-city, New York City-city
New York City-city, New York City-city (yeah)

Army jacket swag, army jacket green and black
With the square top pocket that snaps
Where the gas at?
Pass that, not you, you hold cracks in your asscrack
I never did that, my sock's where my stash was at
Yo, I used to listen to that Red Alert and Rap Attack
I fell in love with all that poetry I mastered that
Cutting school where Preme team and Fat Cat was at
Future not crystal clear yet, Baccarat
Now I'm the one who repping Queens
Way beyond your wildest dreams
Bottles on bottles with sparklers surround my team
That long cash get the baddest bitches out they jeans
Twenty years in this game, looking seventeen
I don't lean: no codeine, promethazine
I just blow green, pick which bitch to bless the king
Although he’s on to another chapter
Heavy D gave this beat to Salaam for me to rap to, raaaahhh

Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don
Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don, dance
Inna New York City-city, New York City-city
New York City-city, New York City-city

Yeah, yeah
New York is like an Island, a big Rikers Island
The cops be out wilding, all I hear is sirens
It's all about surviving
Same old two-step, try to stay alive when they be out robbing
I been out rhyming since born knowledge
Like prophet Muhammad said the ink from a scholar
Worth more than the blood of a martyr, so I'ma
Keep it on 'til I see a billion dollars
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Love model chocha, mommy pop it like she 'pose to
Eyes red shot like I'm never sober
Big time smoker, Indonesian doja
Mini me's you can hold up
Before you end up wet up from my soldier
Don shit, under fire I remain on some calm shit
This for every ghetto in the hood
Nas the Don, Super Cat the Don Dada, understood

Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don
Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don, dance
Inna New York City-city, New York City-city
New York City-city, New York City-city, New York...
This is what, this what they want, huh?
This is what it's all about?
Time to take Affirmative Action, son
They just don't understand, you kna'mean?
Niggas comin' sideways, thinkin' stuff is sweet, man
Niggas don't understand the four devils
Lust, envy, hate, jealousy—wicked niggas, man

Yo, sit back, relax, catch your contact
Sip your con-gi-ac
And let's all wash this money through this laundromat
Sneak attack the new cats in rap, worth top dollar
In fact, touch mines and I'll react like a Rottweiler
Who could relate? We play for high stakes at gunpoint
Catch 'em and break, undress 'em
Tie 'em with tape, no escape
The Corleone, fettuccine Capone
Roam in your own zone
Or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome
We got it sewn, The Firm art of war is unknown
Lower your tone, face it, homicide cases get blown
Aristocrats, politickin' daily with diplomats
See me, I'm an official mack, Lex Coupe triple black

Criminal thoughts in the blue Porsche
My destiny's to be the new boss
That nigga Paulie gotta die, he too soft
That nigga's dead on, a ki of heroin
They found his head on the couch
With his dick in his mouth; I put the hit out
Yo, the smoothest killer since Bugsy
Bitches love me, and Queens where my drugs be
I wear Guess jeans and rugbies
Yo, my people from Medina, they will see ya
When you re-up, bring your heater
All your cream go between us
Real shit, my Desert Eagle got a ill grip
I chill with niggas that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks
My red beam made a dread scream and sprayed a fed team
Corleone be turnin' niggas to fiends
Yukons and ninja black Lexus
Mega the pretty boy, with mafia connections
It's The Firm, nigga, set it

Yo, my mind is seeing through your design like Blind Fury
I shine jewelry, sippin' on crushed grapes, we lust papes
And push cakes inside the casket at Just wake
It's sickenin', he just finished bidding upstate
And now the projects is talking that somebody-gotta-die shit
It's logic as long as it's nobody that's in my clique
My man Smoke know how to expand coke in Mr. Coffee
Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me
Life's a bitch, but God forbid the bitch divorce me
I'll be flooded with ice, so hell fire can't scorch me
Cuban cigars meeting Foxy at the Mosque
Moving cars, your top papi Señor Escobar

In the black Camaro
Firm deep, all my niggas hail the blackest sparrow
Wallabee's be the apparel
Through the darkest tunnel
I got visions of multi millions in the biggest bundle
In the Lex pushed by my nigga Jungle
E Money bags got Moët Chandon
Bundle of sixty-two
They ain't got a clue what we about to do
My whole team, we shittin' hard like Czar
Sosa, Foxy Brown, Cormega and Escobar
I keep a fat marquess piece, laced in all the illest snake skin
Armani sweaters, Carolina Herrera
Be The Firm, baby, from BK to the Bridge, my nigga Wiz
Operation Firm Biz, so what the deal is?
I keep a phat jew-el, sippin' Crist-ies
Sittin' on top of fifty grand in the Nautica Van
We stay incogni' like all them thug niggas in Marcy
The gods, they praise Allah with visions of Gandhi
Bet it on my whole crew is Don Juan
On Cayman Island with a case of Cristal
And Baba Shallah spoke
Nigga with them Cubans that snort coke
Raw though, an ounce mixed with leak, that's pure though
Flippin' the bigger picture
The bigger nigga with the cheddar was mad dripper
He had a fuckin' villa in Manilla
We got to flee to Panama, but wait, it's half-and-half
Ki's is one and two-fifth, so how we flip?
32 grams raw, chop it in half, get 16
Double it times three, we got 48
Which mean a whole lot of cream
Divide the profit by four
Subtract it by eight, we back to 16
Now add the other two that 'Mega bringing through
So let's see, if we flip this other ki
Then that's more for me, mad coke and mad leak
Plus a five hundred cut in half is two-fifty
Now triple that times three
We got three quarters of another ki

The Firm, baby, volume one
I know I can
Be what I wanna be
If I work hard at it
I'll be where I wanna be
I know I can (I know I can!)
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be!)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it!)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be!)

Be, b-boys and girls, listen up
You can be anything in the world, in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress
But nothing comes easy, it takes much practice
Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lena Horne, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person, got her strung on that heroin
Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Could've died, so young, now looks ugly and old
No fun 'cause when she reaches for hugs, people hold their breath
'Cause she smells of corrosion and death
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how
Put your hands in the air, and take the vow

I know I can (I know I can!)
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be!)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it!)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be!)
I know I can (I know I can!)
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be!)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it!)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be!)

Be, b-boys and girls, listen again
This is for grown-looking girls who's only 10
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID
Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
You thinking life's all about smoking weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this

I know I can (I know I can!)
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be!)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it!)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be!)
Now, go…
I know I can (I know I can!)
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be!)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it!)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be!)

Be, be-fore we came to this country
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
There was empires in Africa called Kush
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian Arabs and gave them gold, when
Gold was converted to money it all changed
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded
They heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose to impose what basically
Still goes on today, you see?
If the truth is told, the youth can grow
They learn to survive until they gain control
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more, learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king
Young Princess when you get your wedding ring
Your man is saying "She's my Queen"

I know I can (I know I can!)
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be!)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it!)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be!)
I know I can (I know I can!)
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be!)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it!)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be!)

Save the music, y'all
Save the music, y'all
Save the music, y'all
Save the music, y'all
Save the music
Escobar Season has returned
It's been a long time, been a long time comin'
It's life or death for me now
But you know, there's no turnin' back now
This is what makes me, this is what I am
Feel me? Let's go

You can hate me now, (Q.B.)
But I won't stop now (Real niggas)
'Cause I can't stop now, (Bravehearts)
You can hate me now (C'mon)
But I won't stop now
'Cause I can't stop now
You can hate me now
You can hate me now

Well, you hate me, I'm gon' hate you too
It's as simple as that
Die motherfucker, die motherfucker, die!
You don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
Go down any way you want it to go down (do it now)
Weak, jealous motherfuckers! (do it now, do it now)
Fuck y'all!

Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy
Ice that I wear, flows that I try
Close your eyes, picture me rollin', Sixes, money foldin'
Bitches, honeys that swollen to riches, Nas get in ya
Most critically acclaimed Pulitzer Prize winner
Best storyteller, thug narrator, my style's greater
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters
Commentators ringside try watchin' my paper
Almost a decade, quite impressive
Most of the best is in the essence for this rap shit that I stand for
Expandin' more to the big screen, Bill Gates dreams
But it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens
Want me off the scene fast, but good things last
Like your favorite MC still makin' some mean cash
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque back to the projects
But you still wanna hate, be my guest, I suggest

Money is power, motherfucker!
I got millions of thugs on salary, bitch!

You can hate me now, (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (I can't stop)
'Cause I can't stop now, (You can hate me)
You can hate me now (I hate you too)
But I won't stop now (You can hate me now)
'Cause I can't stop now (You can hate me now)
You can hate me now
You can hate me now

Do it now! I told you, do it now!
Let's go

You wanna hate me, then hate me; what can I do
But keep gettin' money? Funny, I was just like you
I had to hustle hard, never give up, until I made it
Now y'all sayin': "That's a clever nigga, nothin' to play with."
Hate on me, I blew but I'm the same O.G.
People warn me, when you're on top there's envy
Took my niggas out the hood, but you doubt on us
Sayin' we left the hood but can't get it out of us
My bad, should I step out my shoes, give 'em to you?
Here's my cars and my house, you can live in that too
Criticize when I flow for the streets, hate my dress code
Gucci this, Fendi that – what you expect, ho?
Nickname Esco, took this game to its threshold
Best flow, I bet the whole U.S. know
Try to make it like you the realest, but who the illest?
Think we all know the answer to that, 'cause niggas feel this, right?

You think I'ma come this far
And let you niggas stop me now?
I hate you too!

You can hate me now, (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (I can't stop)
'Cause I can't stop now, (You can hate me)
You can hate me now (I hate you too)
But I won't stop now (You can hate me now)
'Cause I can't stop now (You can hate me now)
You can hate me now
You can hate me now

I like this, I like the way this feels

It's a thin line between paper and hate
Friends and snakes, nine milli's and thirty-eights
Hell or the Pearly Gates; I was destined to come
Predicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs
Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows
Shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one
Took a little time to claim my spot
Chairman of the board until this game stop, and I side with the Lord
Ride for the cause while drivin' niggas shot at my doors
Plottin' I'm sure, to catch me with they Glocks to my jaws
Tried stickin' me up, but I flipped on these ducks
Instead of me, ambulances were pickin' them up
Niggas fear what they don't understand
Hate what they can't conquer, guess it's just the theory of man
Became a monster, on top of the world, never fallin'
I'm as real as they come, from day one, forever ballin', c'mon!

You ain't never seen a nigga like me ever in your life
And that's what you can't understand!

You can hate me now, (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (I can't stop)
'Cause I can't stop now, (You can hate me)
You can hate me now (I hate you too)
But I won't stop now (You can hate me now)
'Cause I can't stop now (You can hate me now)
You can hate me now
You can hate me now

You can hate me now, (C'mon, niggas!)
But I won't stop now (Do it now! Get this shit over with!)
It ain't gon' never stop, niggas!
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby

Bye baby, I guess you knew why I walked away
When we walked to the altar, that was an awesome day
Did counselling, couldn't force me to stay
Something happens when you say I do, we go astray
Why did we mess it up? We was friends, we had it all
Reason you don't trust men, that was your daddy fault
He in the grave – let it go, he no longer living
Said you caught him cheating with mom, fucking other women
Fuck that gotta do with us? Here's the keys to the newest truck
Birkin bags, we burning cash, now baby, do it up
No matter who you fuck, that was before me
Wanted you as my shorty since before I saw you screaming
"Hate you so much right now"
Should've saw the meaning, angry black woman
Actions of a demon, I'm leaving

I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby (Bye baby)
You know I'm saying bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby)
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby

Bye baby, I guess you know why I had to leave
Seven months in your pregnancy, 'bout to have my seed
Let's take it back some years, rewind it to the happy years
You and your Star Trak fam, I'm thinking you cats are weird
Same time, different year, I was digging y'all flow
Then I tatted you on my arm so niggas would know
I thought no one could stop us, matching gold watches
I was your Johnny Depp, you was my Janis Joplin
Yet the cuter version, yet I knew you personally
Better than you knew yourself – and I knew this for certain
Crib in the Dominican, you got away from everybody
You screaming at the racist cops in Miami was probably
The highlight of my life, like "Ha, yo, look at my wife!"
Gangsta, me and 20 cops 'bout to fight, crazy night
Bailed you out, next morning we got clean
Like it never happened, and later we at that Heat game
Just another day in the life of two people in love
But it wasn't enough, so baby, guess what...

I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby (Bye baby)
OH! OH! AHHHHHHHH! Bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)
I can't believe that this is happening to us
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby)
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby

Listen, could you imagine writing your deposition
Divorce lawyer telling you how this thing gonna be ending?
With you paying out the ass and I'm talking half
Not some, but half, no, serious, half
Half of your soul, half of your heart, you leaving behind
It’s either that or die, I wanted peace of mind
And all I seen was selfish cowards
Under their breath, saying, "Why did Nas trust her?"
But look at yourself! Speak louder, bruh!
You live with your baby moms
And scared to make an honest woman out of her
And make her your bride, fake pimps, you ain't even alive
At least I can say I tried plus enjoyed the ride
Plus we got our little boy, my little joy and pride
He got my nose, my grill, your color, your eyes
Next go round I hope I pick the truest type
And watch me do it all again – it’s a beautiful life, aight?
Goodbye!

(Bye baby) Baby.. baby
You know I'm saying bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)
I can't believe that this is happening to us
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby)
I guess you knew and blew a good thing
You know I'm saying bye-bye
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby

'Til we make love just one more time
Make it seem forever
This is our last and final goodbye
Goodbye
Bravehearts, Bravehearts, Bravehearts…

Now let's get it all in perspective
For all y'all enjoyment, a song y'all can step with
Y'all appointed me to bring rap justice
But I ain't five-O, y'all know it's Nas, yo
Grey Goose and a whole lot of hydro
Only describe us as soldier survivors
Stay laced in the best, well-dressed
With finesse in a white tee, lookin' for wifey
Thug girl who fly and talks so nicely
Put her in the coupe so she can feel the nice breeze
We can drive through the city, no doubt
But don't say my car's topless, say the titties is out
Newness, here's the anthem
Put your hand up that you shoot with, count your loot with
Push the pool stick in your new crib
Same hand that you hoop with, swing around like you stupid
King of the town? Yeah, I been that
You know I click-clack — where you and your mens at?
Do the Smurf, do the Wop, Baseball Bat
Rooftop like we bringin' '88 back

They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas? Where them dimes at?
They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas at? Where them dimes at?

This ain't rappin', this is Street Hop
Now get up off yo' ass like your seat's hot
My live niggas lit up the reefer
Trunk of the car, we got the streetsweeper
Don't start none, won't be none
No reason for your mans to panic
You don't wanna see no ambulances
Knock a pimp's drink down in his pimp cup
That's the way you get Timberland'd up
Let the music diffuse all the tension
Baller convention, free admission
Hustlers, dealers and killers can move swift
Girls get close, you can feel where the tool's kept
All my just-comin' homies, parolees
Get money, leave the beef alone slowly
Get out my face, you people so phony
Pull out my waist, the Eagle four-forty

They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas? Where them dimes at?
They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas at? Where them dimes at?

I see niggas runnin', yo, my mood is real rude
I lay you out, show you what steel do
Mobsters don't box, my pump shot obliges
Every invitation to fight you punk-asses
Like Pun said: you ain't even en mi clasa
Maybach Benz, back seat, TV plasma
Ladies lookin' for athletes or rappers
Whatever you choose, whatever you do
Make sure he a thug and intelligent too
Like a real thoroughbred is
Show me love, let me feel how the head is
Females who's the sexiest is always the nastiest

And I like a little sassiness
A lot of class; Mami, reach in your bag, pass the fifth
I'm a leader at last, this a don you with
My 9's will spit, niggas lose consciousness
(Y'all ready for Nas?
Queensbridge, y'all ready to see Nasty Nas?
Uh huh, they ready)
Yeah, word
Got some Rémy Martin
And some good-ass cigars, check it out

Ayo, late night, candlelight, fiend with diesel in his needle
Queensbridge leader, no equal
I come from the Wheel of Ezekiel
To pop thousand-dollar bottles of Scotch
Smoke pot and heal the people
Any rebuttal to what I utter get box-cutter'd
Count how many bad honeys I slut, it's a high number
Name a nigga under the same sky that I'm under
Who gets money, remain fly, yeah, I wonder
Eyes flutter, it's love when Nas pops up
Stars get starstruck, panties start drippin'
The ways of Carlito, blaze, torpedo cigars
Drop Rolls, hoes drop clothes
Louis the XIII, freaks, women nice size
I ride like Porsches, thick, brown and gorgeous
It ain't my fault, semi-automatic weapons I brought
The world crazy, I'm rich and I'm girl-crazy
Dick 'em, convince ‘em all to praise me
They ideology is confusion, I lose 'em
Fellates me, who hate me? My gun off safety
Since the Tunnel and Skate Key, my jewelry in HD

Silent rage, pristine in my vintage shades
I'm not in the winters of my life or the beginning stage
I am the dragon
Maserati, pumpin' Biggie, the great legend
Blastin', I'm after the actress who played Faith Evans
My little Jackie Onassis, dig?
I'm so high I never land like Mike Jackson's crib
Vest on, .45 still crack ya rib, sacrilege
Talk trash 'bout the Nasty kid
Past nasty now, I'm gross and repulsive
Talk money, is you jokin'?
Cash everywhere, in my bank, in the sofa
In the walls, in the cars, in my wallet, in my pocket
On the floors, ceilings, the safe, bitch, I got it
You envy, but don't offend me
I'm skinny, but still I'm too big for a Bentley
You are your car, what could represent me?
Too Godly to be a Bugatti, you honestly
Must design me somethin' Tommy Mottonic from Queens had before the 90's
Drug dealer car, rush to the bar
Move, niggas! We don't give a fuck who you are
Black card heavy like a magnet in my stitched denims
Pretty women see them saggin'
Bet a hundred stacks niggas'll run it back
Just havin' fun, I ain't even begun to black
Light another blunt in fact, haha...

(Nasty) Nasty kid
(Nasty) Yeah...
(Nasty) The kid! (Nasty) Yeah...
(Nasty) Nasty kid (Nasty)

For the hustlers, thick as yellow bitches for the suck of it
Got a bunch of niggas in prison braggin'
Saying, "It was Nas I used to hustle with"
I display fashions while my lungs engage hashish
Guns on my waist, past this
Since I'm cakin' up, put funds in my safe, laughin'
And joinin' the blunt passin' you niggas was straight assin'
Excuse the vulgarity, I'm still not fully adjusted
Or used to the new fans hearin' me spit rapidly
I never see the whips niggas be claimin' they drivin'
I guess entertainment means blatantly lyin'
Fake it 'til you make it, I've driven those toys
Been in them wars, in the streets, cops kickin' in doors
For my team nigga, your flow cheap as limousine liquor
I’m no fake rap CD listener, sit back and roll a mean swisher
For my G's, tell these clowns make room for the king, nigga
One time for your mind, one time
Yeah, whatever
One time for your mind, one time
Yo, whatever
One time for your mind, one time
Hey yo, Nas? Kick that fuckin' rhyme!

Check it out, when I'm chilling, I grab the buddha
Get my crew to buy beers
And watch a flick, illin' and root for the villain, huh
Plus every morning, I go out and love it sort of chilly
Then I send a shorty from my block to the store for Phillies
After being blessed by the herb's essence
I'm back to my rest, ten minutes, some odd seconds
That's where I got the honey at, spends the night for sexin'
Keep lubrication, Lifestyle protection
Hitting up my stereo's remote control quickly
Ron G's in the cassette deck, rocking the shit, G
I try to stay mellow, rock, well a cappella rhymes'll
Make me richer than a slipper made Cinderella, fella
Go get your crew, Hobbes, I'm prepared to bomb troops
Y'all niggas was born, I shot my way out my mom dukes
When I was ten I was a hip-hoppin' shorty wop
Known for rocking microphones and twisting off a 40 top

One time for your mind, one time
Yeah, whatever
One time for your mind, one time
It sounds clever
Hey yo, Nas? Fuck that, man, that shit is phat
But kick that for them gangstas; fuck all that!
Right, right

What up, niggas, how y'all? It's Nasty, the villain
I'm still writing rhymes, but besides that I'm chillin'
I'm tryin' to get this money, God
You know the hard times, kid
Shit, cold, be starving make you wanna do crimes kid
But I'ma lamp, ‘cause a crime couldn't beat a rhyme
Niggas catching 3 to 9's, Muslims yelling "Free the mind"
And I'm from Queensbridge, been to many places
As a kid when I would say that out of town, niggas chased us
But now I know the time, got a older mind
Plus control a 9, fine, see now I represent mine
I'm new on the rap scene, brothers never heard of me
Yet I'm a menace, yo, police wanna murder me
Heini Dark drinker, represent the thinker
My pen rides the paper, it even has blinkers
Think I'll dim the lights, then inhale, it stimulates
Floating like I'm on the North 95 Interstate
Never plan to stop, when I write my hand is hot
And expand a lot from the Wiz to Camelot
The parlayer, I'll make your heads bop, pa
I shine a light on perpetrators, like a cop's car
From day to night, I play the mic and you'll thank God
I wreck shit so much, the microphone'll need a paint job
My brain is incarcerated
Live at any jam, I couldn't count all the parks I've raided
I hold a MAC-11, and attack a reverend
I contact eleven L's and max in heaven

One time for your mind, one time
It sounds clever
One time for your mind, one time
Yeah, whatever
One time for your mind, one time
Yo, from '92 to '99

Yeah, that shit was crazy fat, pa
Know what I’m sayin'?
But check it, you got another verse for me
I want you to kick it, you know what I'm sayin'?
Kick that shit for the projects
You'll live, and you'll learn
See 'cause you've never been the same as anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else
You'll love, and you'll learn
See you'll never conclude with anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else

If I had everything, everything
I could change anything
If I changed anything, I mean anything
I would change everything, oh yeah

Dark boy, don't you cry
There's too much life left in those eyes
Don't you let that face go waterfall
Don't you learn to love your scars and all
Dark boy, don't you die
They're just human, let them lie
You just know your world and speak your truth
Let them come to you
For you'll love, in your heart
See cause you've never been the same as anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else
This is your call, there are no wrongs
See you'll never conclude with anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else

If I had everything, everything
I could change anything, I could change anything
If I changed anything, I mean anything
I would change everything, oh yeah

When the media slings mud, we use it to build huts
Irrefutable facts, merciful, beautiful black
Beloved brother, you fail to embarrass him, harassin' him
To my life, your life pales in comparison
So go write whatever blog, messiness is not ever the God
Do what's necessary, I'm never worried
Listen vultures, I've been shackled by Western culture
You convinced most of my people to live off emotion
That's why we competin'
Death by the chrome barrel, forgot the secrets
My Kilimanjaro bone marrow's the deepest
You can peep at the comments, but don't fall for that
We want freedom, I'm a scholar, an almanac
People do anything to be involved in everything
Inclusion is a hell of a drug
Some people have everything they probably ever wanted in life
And never have enough

If I had everything, everything
I could change anything
If I changed anything, I mean anything
I would change everything, oh yeah

From the birth of a child, the world is foul
Excursions of a searchin' child
Should learn to take nothin' personal
A parent hates to watch his baby's face
Takin' his first immunization shots, but this is great
The child's introduction to suffering and pain
Understands without words, nothin' is explained
Or rushed to the brain, lookin' up at his parents' face
Like, "I thought you would protect me from this scary place?"
"Why'd you let them inject me?"
"Who's gonna know how these side effects is gonna affect me?"
Who knew I would grow to meet presidents that respect me?
If Starbucks is bought by Nestlé, please don't arrest me
I need to use your restroom and I ain't buy no espresso
Soon enough, assume the cuffs, the position
Not new to us, since back on the bus sittin'
Said, "Screw that bus!" – boycotted that bus outta business
The future's us, yet every citizen's in prison

If I had everything, everything
I could change anything
If I changed anything, I mean anything
I would change everything, oh yeah

Watch me as I walk through the folly, golly, New York to Saudi
In Italy, I'm Eduardo Wiccari
But Nasty the hustler, nasty like mustard gas, sulfur
And I could sell Alaska to Russia, no pressure
My first house, 11,000-square-feet mansion
It was a haunted by dead rich whites
Mad a nigga bought his crib to hang up pictures of black Christ
Circular driveways, black cars and black ice
My second house, still in my twenties, illin' with money
Chilled through my spine, spillin' wine, it's funny
Did good for a staircase loiterer, euphoria
What you saw when you seen a teen turn to a warrior
Did every Fourth of July, bustin' in the sky
It was important to a guy who was mob-minded
Future Murcielago driver 'til Lambos got average on me
I started likin' the look like I ain't had no money
Yellow taxi seats over Maybach seats
Just to remind me, just to inspire me
To stay focused, it's a real sick society
Just cause I got your support don't mean you're buyin' me
I'm buyin' back the land owned by the slave masters
Where my ancestors lived, just to say a rapper
Made a change, the pants-sagger put plans in action
To lay claim the Pan-African made it happen

You'll live, and you'll learn
See cause you've never been the same anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else
You'll live, and you'll learn
See you'll never conclude with anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else

If I had everything, everything
I could change anything
If I changed anything, I mean anything
I would change everything, oh yeah

Dark boy, don't you cry
There's too much life left in those eyes
Don't you let that face go waterfall
Don't you learn to love your scars and all
Dark boy, don't you die
They're just human, let them lie
You just know your world and speak your truth
And let them come to you
For you'll love, in your heart
See cause you've never been the same as anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else
This is your call, there are no wrongs
See you'll never conclude with anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else
Street's disciple, my raps are trifle
I shoot slugs from my brain just like a rifle
Stampede the stage, I leave the microphone split
Play Mr. Tuffy while I'm on some Pretty Tone shit
Verbal assassin, my architect pleases
When I was 12, I went to…

And you're sitting at home doing this shit
I should be earning a medal for this
Stop fuckin' around and be a man
There ain't nothin' out here for you

Oh yes, there is… This

Yo, Nas, yo, what the fuck is this bullshit on the radio, son?

Chill, chill! That's the shit, God, chill

Ayo, yo, pull down the shade, man
Let's count this money, nigga
Ayo, Nas, put the Jacksons and the Grants over there!
You know what I'm sayin'?
‘Cause we spendin' the Jacksons
You know how we get down, baby

True, true

Nas, yo, Nas, man
Shit is mad real right now in the projects
For a nigga, yo, word to mother
All them crab-ass rappers be comin' up to me
Man, word to mother, man
I think we need to let them niggas know it's real, man

True indeed, knamsayin'?
But when it's real you doin' this
Even without a record contract, knamsayin'?

No question

Been doing this since back then

I'm sayin' regardless how it go down we gon' keep it real
We tryin' to see many mansions and Coupes, kid

No doubt, we gon' keep it real, true, true

Ayo, where's Grand Wizard and Mayo at, man?
Takin' niggas a long time, man

Who got the Phillies? Take this Hennessy

Ayo, dunn
C'mon, c'mon, man, stop wavin' that, man!
Stop pointin' that at me, dunn, take the clip out!

Nigga, alright, but take this Hennessy, man!

I'm sayin' take the clip, man, c'mon, take it out!

Light them Phillies up, man!
Niggas stop fuckin' burnin' Phillies, man
Light some Phillies up then!

Pass that henrock, pass that henrock!
Nigga, act like you know!

Yo, we drinkin' this straight up with no chaser
I ain't fuckin' with you, nigga

I'm saying though, man

What is it, what is it, baby?

What is it, son, what is it?

You know what time it is

I'm saying, man, you know what I'm saying?
Niggas don't listen, man
Representin', it's Illmatic
Get, get, get down!

New York streets where killers will walk like Pistol Pete
And Pappy Mason, gave the young boys admiration
Prince from Queens and Fritz from Harlem
Street legends, the drugs kept the hood from starvin'
Pushin' cars, Nicky Barnes was the '70s
But there's a long list of high-profile celebrities
Worldwide on the thorough side of things
Livest kings, some died, one guy, one time
One day grabs me, as I'm about to blast heat
40-side of Vernon, I turned while he asked me
"What you up to? The cops gon' bust you."
I was a teen drunk off brew
Stumbled I wondered if God sent him
'Cause two squad cars entered the block
And looked at us; I ain't flinch when they watched
I took it upstairs, the bathroom mirror, brushed my hair
Starin' at a young disciple
I almost gave my life to what the dice do
Yeah man, throwin' them bones
Hopin' my ace get his case thrown
His girl ain't wait for him, she in the world straight hoein'
While he lookin' at centerfolds of pretty girls showin'
They little cooch; gangstas don't die, he's living proof
The D.A. who tried him was lyin'
A white dude, killed his mother during the case
Hung jury, now the D.A. is being replaced
Pre-trial hearing is over, it's real for the soldier
Walks in the courtroom, the look in his eyes is wild
Triple-homicide, I sit in the back aisle
I wanna crack a smile when I see him
Throw up a fist for Black Power, 'cause all we want is his freedom
He grabbed a court officer's gun and started squeezin'
Then he grabbed the judge, screams out, "Nobody leavin'
Everybody—"

Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!
Everybody
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!

Some niggas fuck their enemies in their ass when they catch 'em
Weird-ass niggas are dangerous so don't test 'em
They make you disappear, this a year that I won't forget
Sold CD's double platinum, met mo' execs
Southern niggas, independent label, real killas
Know the business, ran Tennessee for years, now they chillin'
They had the coke game somethin' crazy
Sold music out the trunk of their car, that shit amazed me
Put me onto heroin blunts, sherm or somethin'
Took a puff, what the fuck? I turned to punch him
Southern niggas ain't slow, nigga tried to play me
I left from around them dudes, they cool but they crazy
Now I'm back around the old school that raised me
New York gangsters, we loungin', out in L.A. see
A dude wrote my dog from Pelican Bay
The letter say, "Nas, I got your back, the fools don't play."
I rolled with some Crips down to a Crenshaw funeral
Never saw so many men slaughtered and I knew the ho
Responsible; the nigga still alive in a hospital
Midnight they crept in his room and shot the doctor too
See, my cousin's in the game, thuggin' and thangs
He plugged me with a dame who was half-Mexicano
Gave the ass up, I'm a mack daddy Soprano
She passed me the indigo, but the imbecile
Shoulda never tippy-toed, thought my eyes were closed
Openin' the hotel room door to let her goons in
But I moved in a manner on some Jet Li shit
I let the hammers blow, wet three kids
See honey thought I had somethin' to do with all the drama
'Cause I was with a crew that had her people killed
Called up my cousin, told him I ain't fuckin' with you
He responded "cool," but told me out here this how motherfuckers—

Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!
Everybody
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!

All I really gotta say is that
If that's how our people gon' get down, how we ever gon' get up?
How we ever gon' get up if that's how we get down?
A shame when you really look at it
My folk against your folk, but we all kinfolk
Somebody got to make a change
("I wrote my way out")
When the world turned its back on me
I was up against the wall
I had no foundation
No friends and no family to catch my fall
Runnin' on empty, th'was nothin' left in me but doubt
I picked up a pen and "I wrote my way—" out

I picked up the pen like Hamilton
Street analyst, now I write words that try to channel 'em
No political power—just lyrical power
Sittin' on a crate on a corner, sippin' for hours
Schemin' on a come up, from evening'to sun up
My man awaitin' trial, misdemeanors we younger
Courtroom prejudice, insufficient evidence
Jailhouse lawyers, these images still relevant
Flickerin' lights inside my project hall
Sickenin', the mice crawl all night long
And '87 Reaganism, many pages I've written on
Writin' songs about rights and wrongs and bails bonds
Master bedroom, bigger than the crib that I was raised at
I'm the architect like I wrote the code to Waze app
I'm driven, black Elohim from the streets of Queens
The definition of what It Was Written means
Know what I mean?

("I wrote my way out")
When the world turned its back on me
I was up against the wall
I had no foundation
No friends and no family to catch my fall
Runnin' on empty, there was nothin' left in me but doubt
I picked up a pen and "I wrote my way—" out

I really wrote my way up out of 6E
Develop relationships with fiends, I know they miss me
Before the metrocards, it was tokens, I did the ten speed
Never had wrote a rhyme in my life, what was a sixteen?
At sixteen, arrested in housin', trips to the mountains
Came right back, trappin' off couches, watchin' for mouses
Only tools we was posed with, had a spot, smoke lit
The hate is just confusion, pay attention how them jokes switch
Diadora was my favorite, the Mark Buchanans
Mama couldn't afford them, I learned everythin' on the border
That's a big 8, Clicquot parties with private dancers with no mixtape
Bumble Bee Tuna, now we could get steak
I persevered, composition, I kept it close
Competition near, I'm a Spartan without the spear
Three hundred rhymes, it was written before I wrote it
Opportunity knockin', might miss it, that window closin'
This poetry in motion, I'm a poet

("I wrote my way out")
When the world turned its back on me
I was up against the wall
I had no foundation
No friends and no family to catch my fall
Runnin' on empty, there was nothin' left in me but doubt
I picked up a pen and I wrote my way out!

High speed, dubbin' these rhymes in my dual cassette deck
Runnin' out of time like I'm Jonathan Larson's rent check
My mind is where the wild things are, Maurice Sendak
In withdrawal, I want it all, please give me that pen back
Y'all, I caught my first beatin' from the other kids when I was caught readin';
"Oh, you think you smart?"—Blah!—start bleedin'
My pops tried in vain to get me to fight back
Sister tapped my brains, said, "Pssh—you'll get 'em right back."
Oversensitive, defenseless, I made sense of it, I pencil in
The lengths to which I'd go to learn my strengths and knock 'em senseless
These sentences are endless, so what if they leave me friendless?
"Damn, you got no chill," fuckin' right—I'm relentless
I know Abuela's never really gonna win the lottery
So it's up to me to draw blood with this pen, hit an artery
This Puerto Rican's brains are leakin' through the speakers
And if he can be the shinin' beacon this side of the G.W.B and
Shine a light when it's gray out?

("I wrote my way out")
Oh, I was born in the eye of a storm
No lovin' arms to keep me warm
This hurricane in my brain is the burden I bear
I can do without, I'm here (I'm here)
'Cause "I wrote my way—" out!

"—picked up the pen like Hamilton"
"I wrote my way out of the pro—"
"—wrote—"
"—wrote my way out of the projects"
"—pick—"
"—picked up the pen like Hamilton"
"I wrote my way out of the—"
"—wrote—"
"—wrote my way out of the—"
("I wrote my way—")
"—picked up the pen like Hamilton"
"I wrote my way out of the pro—"
"—wrote—"
"—wrote my way out of the projects"
("I wrote my way out")

"Really, I saw, like, a hole in the rap game, so, if I wanted to put my little two cents in the game, then it would be from a different perspective."
("I wrote my way out")
"I thought that I would represent for my neighborhood and tell their story, be their voice, in a way that nobody has done it. Tell the real story."
Damn
Look how muh-fuckers use a nigga
Just use me for whatever the fuck they want
I don't get to say shit
Just grab me, just do what the fuck they want
Sell me, throw me away
Niggas just don't give a fuck about a nigga like me, right
Like I'm a f-, I'm a gun, shit
It's like I'm a motherfucking gun
I can't believe this shit
Word up, word up

I seen some cold nights and bloody days
They grab me and bullets spray
They use me wrong so I sing this song 'til this day
My body is cold steel for real
I was made to kill, that's why they keep me concealed
Under car seats they sneak me in clubs
Been in the hands of mad thugs
They feed me when they load me with mad slugs
Seventeen precisely, one in my head
They call me Desert Eagle, semi-auto with lead
I'm seven inches four pounds, been through so many towns
Ohio to Little Rock to Canarsie, living harshly
Beat up and battered they pull me out
I watch as niggas scattered, making me kill
But what I feel it never mattered
When I'm empty I'm quiet, finding myself fiending to be fired
A broken safety, niggas place me in shelves
Under beds so I beg for my next owner to be a thoroughbred
Keep me full up with hollow heads

How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild

Always I'm in some shit
My abdomen is the clip, the barrel is my dick uncircumcised
Pull my skin back and cock me
I bust off when they unlock me
Results of what happens to niggas shock me
I see niggas bleeding running from me in fear, stunningly tears
Fall down the eyes of these so-called tough guys, for years
I've been used in robberies, giving niggas heart to follow me
Placing peoples in graves, funerals made cause I was sprayed
I was laid in a shelf, with a grenade
Met a wrecked-up TEC with numbers on his chest that say
Five-two-oh-nine-three-eight-five and zero
Had a serial defaced, hoping one day police would place
Where he came from, a name or some sort of person to claim him
Tired of murdering, made him wanna be a plain gun
But yo, I had some other plans like the next time the beef is on
I make myself jam right in my owner's hand

How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild

Yo, weeks went by and I'm surprised
Still stuck in the shelf with all the things that an outlaw hides
Besides me it's bullets, two vests and then a nine
There's a grenade in a box, and that TEC that kept crying
Cause he ain't been cleaned in a year he's rusty, it's clear
He's bout to fall to pieces cause of his murder career
Yo I can hear somebody coming in, open the shelf
His eyes bubbling, he said it was on
I felt his palm troubled him shaking
Somebody stomped him out, his dome was aching
He placed me on his waist, the moment I've been waiting
My creation was for Blacks to kill Blacks
It's gats like me that accidentally go off, making niggas memories
But this time, it's done intentionally
He walked me outside, saw this cat
Cocked me back, said, "Remember me?"
He pulled the trigger but I held on, it felt wrong
Knowing niggas is waiting in hell for him
He squeezed harder, I didn't budge, sick of the blood
Sick of the thugs, sick of wrath of the next man's grudge
What the other kid did was pull out, no doubt
A newer me in better shape, before he lit out, he lead the chase
My owner fell to the floor his wig split so fast
I didn't know he was hit, it's over with
Heard mad niggas screaming, niggas running, cops is coming
Now I'm happy, until I felt somebody else grab me
Damn!
PS 111 had free lunch
Embarrassed but managed to get a plate...
We was kids hungry
Mom's working, I was famished
She getting home late...
So I decided now I'm in charge
Either stay full or starve
Corner store like "Mister, spare-a-quarter"
Before Air Jordans, Kareem Abdul-Jabbars
Trying to cop quarters and trying to move that hard
Roll with a shooting squad
How could I not succumb? How could I not partake?
Fifteen I got a gun
Sixteen I robbed a train
Licked off a shot for fun
What's got inside my brain?
A hustler's job ain't done, til he becomes a king
But I'm a righteous son, despite I'm in the midst of
Dudes who switch up and change
They wanna carry me like I'm some kind of lame
I never let them though, I just forgive them though
Either that or the pistol blow

"Say YEAH! Haha, thank ya! Ahhh, Hallelujah!
Y'all don't hear me now! Somebody help me!"

I remember early mornings, syrup sandwiches, sugar water, yeah
Walking up the dark stairwells, elevators was out of order, yeah
Worth two hundred million now
Bicentennial nigga, flat screens and condominiums
Brazilian women on Xannies they pulling off panties
I'm pushing forty, she only twenty-one
Don't applaud me, I'm exhausted G
Me and my red cup, my blunt and my red cup
Y'all wouldn't know me without one, I keep a fresh cut
Remember talking to Biggie inside his Lex truck
Said stay fly when you bummy, keep your pajamas Armani
Hood forever, I just act like I'm civilized
Really what's in my mind is organizing a billion Black motherfuckers
To take over J.P. and Morgan, Goldman and Sachs
And teach the world facts and give Saudi they oil back

"Say YEAH! Haha, thank ya! Ahhh, Hallelujah!
Y'all don't hear me now! Somebody help me!"

1990's Polo Ralph Lauren on him
Gone a few years, the whole world snoring on him
Girls all up on him
I spread em, hit 'em and dead 'em
She says, third leg from a legend is sheer heaven
She says, it is the greatest loving
The tales you hear is the truth on me
Who wasn't the most faithful husband
Reveal my life, you will forgive me
You will love me, hate me, judge me, relate to me
Only a few will, this how it sounds when you're too real
They think it's just music still
Well I am a graphic classic song composer
Music notes on sheets, I wrote this piece to get closure
Some of y'all might know Kelis
This goes to her with love, also goes to y'all, let's see
The craziest things already happened to me
So either you'll be laughing at me or you're laughing with me, HA!

"Say YEAH! Haha, thank ya! Ahhh, Hallelujah!
Y'all don't hear me now! Somebody help me!"
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that

Yeah
I never brag how real I keep it, cause it's the best secret
I rock a vest prestigious, Cuban link flooded Jesus
In a Lex watching Kathie Lee and Regis
My actions are one with the seasons
A TEC squeezing executioner
Winter time I rock a fur
Mega popular center of attraction
Climaxing, my bitches, they be laughing
They high from sniffing coke off a twenty-cent Andrew Jackson
City lights spark a New York night
Rossi and Martini sipping, Sergio Tacchini
Flipping mad pies, low price
I blow dice and throw them
.45 by my scrotum, manifest the Do or Die slogan
My niggas roll in ten M3's
Twenty Gods popping wheelies on Kawasakis
Hip hop's got me on some ol', spraying shots like a drum roll
Blanking out and never miscount the shells my gun hold
I don't stunt, I regulate
Henny and Sprite, I separate, watching crab niggas marinate
I'm all about TECs, a good jux and sex
Israelite books, holding government names from Ness
MC's are crawling out every hole in the slum
You be aight like blood money in a pimp's cum

I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
For you wack MC's

Currency is made in the trust of the Messiah
I'm spending it to get higher
Earth, Wind and Fire singing Reasons why I'm
Up early, trustworthy is a nine that bust early
Sunshine on my grill, I spill Remy on imaginary graves
Put my hat on my waves, latter Day Saints say religious praise
I dolo, challenge any team or solo
You must be bugging out, new to my shit, home on a furlough
Ask around who's laid up, sharp and straight up
Mafioso, getting niggas' wakes sprayed up
Skies are misty, my life's predicted by a gypsy
I'll one day walk into shots, drunk off champagne from Sicily
This be the drama, I'ma pause like a comma
In a sentence, paragraph's indented
Bloodshot red eyes high, yellow envelopes of lye
Opening cigars let tobacco fly
Condos are tune-proof, we're looking out the sky's moonroof
Shitting like gin and prune juice
Yo the system wants the coon's noose, hang 'em high
Courtrooms filled up, it's off the hook while I
Just wrote a statement, like I'm facing twenty years
In the basement, chilling on the VI with Mumia
For wearing chrome, I told the judge snakes slither
Like Sharon Stone but like Capone I'm thrown, yo

I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
For you wack MC's
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
For you wack MC's

Yo the time is wasting, I use the mind elevation
Dime sack lacing, court pen pacing
Individual, lyrical math abrasion
Psychic evaluation, the foulest nation
We living in dangerous lives, mad leak and battered wives
A lifestyle on bad streets is patternized
Wise men build and destroy
While the real McCoy dope fiend named Detroit is still dealing boy
Coke suppliers acting biased
'Cause rumors say that niggas wear wires and we liars
But every night the gat's fired and every day a rat's hired
I still remain the mack flyest in the phat Kani's
Just a killer in me, slash drug dealer MC
Ex-slug filler, semi mug peeler
Demi, bottles of Mo', yo simply follow me flow
Put poetry inside a crack pot and blow
Rough hoes pull crack out pussies and buttholes
Bring the G's and the D's roll, they can't touch those
Why shoot the breeze about it when you could be about it
My degrees are routed, toward the peasy haired brick houses
Instead of the fake medallions
Rich niggas transport in thousands
Foreign cash exchange amounting to millions
Doors is locked, rocks is chopped, watch the cameras in the ceilings
Trick bitches catching mad feelings
Peeling off in the Lex Jeep, techniques is four-wheeling
I bet it be some shit when we connect with Stretch
When we catch them sex niggas with the TECs you blessed, word
So now it's on, never wasted a slug
Time is money when it comes to mine, take it in blood

I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
For you wack MC's
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
For you wack MC's

Yea, Capone-n-Noreaga
Yeah yo offical Queensbridge murderers
Mobb Deep keep it real though
Motherfucking AZ yo
Mega, Mega, whatever
Scarlett O'Hara, Fox Boogie
East New York
Yambo, Brownsville
Wizard, Far Rockaway
Big Bow, Jersey
Connecticut, DC, Sudan
VA, NC, LA
So on and so on
Big Ha, Houston Fifth Ward
Black Ed, keep it real Moe
(Staaaaaaaay...)

(Staaaaaaaay...) Oooh-oooh-ooooh-ooooooh
Oooh-oooh-ooooooh, ooh-ooooh...
Staaaaaaaay... Oooh-oooh-ooooh-ooooooh
Oooh-oooh-ooooooh, ooooh-ooh-oh...

Peace to the Five Percenters, online engine inventors
Shout to them niggas, family men, bringing home dinners
Watch out for desperate lonely women, hurt your happy home
Miserable and alone, kissable, nice to bone
She not the type deserving of a throne
Her beauty is her curse, she fuck for shoes and a purse
Make me a movie first, can watch you on my phone
I shop in Barcelona, I spend some nights in Rome
Feel like a Knight from England
That's what I named my son, Knight
He was born to be one, that's how my game was won
White 740 Beamer, licked by an angel's tongue
I'm living dangerous son, she got a man, a famous one
Honey be pocket watching, she got a lot of options
Hard to make up her mind deciding which baller to rock with
Hot to death, slim pickings but I'm not impressed
She got the hottest sex, so I guess I'ma just.. stay

(Staaaaaaaay...) Oooh-oooh-ooooh-ooooooh
Oooh-oooh-ooooooh, ooh-ooooh...
Staaaaaaaay... Oooh-oooh-ooooh-ooooooh
Oooh-oooh-ooooooh, ooooh-ooh-oh...

Even though I don't like you
Next Friday night can't wait to fight you
Locked up I would knife you, don't fuck with you
Last month I even bucked at you, you got locked
I felt bad, wait do I got love for you?
I might kill you but do I got love for you?
I want you dead under six feet of soil
At the same time, want you here to witness me while you in misery
We hate each other but it's love, what a thug mystery
Years ago they ate the hearts of a slain enemy
We enemies but your hatred could never enter me
Some seek fame cause they need validation
Some say hating is confused admiration
Spotlight on me, I still look twenty
Still get money, lady killer pushing a Bentley
Maybe niggas could see too much of they failures
Through a nigga who realer
I don't like you near bruh, but I need you to.. stay

(Staaaaaaaay...) Oooh-oooh-ooooh-ooooooh
Oooh-oooh-ooooooh, ooh-ooooh...
Staaaaaaaay... Oooh-oooh-ooooh-ooooooh
Oooh-oooh-ooooooh, ooooh-ooh-oh...
Escobar season begins
Ay yo we ain't posin' for no pictures in 2018
Candid shit only
Scared motherfuckers

Black Kemet gods (yeah), black Egyptian gods (let's go)
Summoned from heaven, blessed, dressed in only Goyard
Homie go hard like Stone and Robert in a stolen car
Shoot the ballot box, no voter cards, they all are frauds
Senegal's finest, minerals, diamonds
The Earth is cursed but I survive many climates
Calm and thoroughly, they try to Hyman Roth me
John Fitzgerald me, the industry never bought me
(You know God sent me here)
Fear will make you reveal who you really are
Feel me God? Be solid, your foes hold you in ill regard
This ain't knowledge, this is not intense
For honored men, women too
Us who can see the same thing, but have a different view (let's go)
All of a sudden, frontin' niggas knew you from your past
Got all kinds of guys sayin' we go way back
And who y'all comparin' me to is nonsense
Show gratitude in the presence of dominance

I think they scared of us, yeah
I think they scared of us
I think they scared of us, yeah
I think they scared
To Catholics…

To Catholics, Moors and Masons (motherfuckers!)
John Hanson was not the first black pres to make it
Abe Lincoln did not free the enslaved
Progress was made 'cause we forced the proclamation
(Fuck your proclamation!)
SWAT was created to stop the Panthers
Glocks were created for murder enhancement
For hunting men, circumstances
Edgar Hoover was black
Willie Lynch is a myth, Colombians created crack
The government made stacks (welcome to America, niggas!)
Reagan had Alzheimer's, that's true
Fox News was started by a black dude, also true (fuck you too!)
Convinced my experiences were meant to be
Helps me navigate as they validate they treachery
Felt established, fake as he smile, handshake questionable
"Am I good?" he ask, thinkin', "But is he testin' you?"
(Is he testin' you?) In my hood, fear does a few things
Make you pussy, make you a snitch
Make irrational moves or even turn you to food

I think they're scared of us, yeah
I think they're scared of us
I think they're scared of us, yeah
I think they scared
I think they scared of us, yeah
I think they scared of us
See, we don't care about what you think about us
I think they scared of us, yeah
What you say about us
I think they scared
You bitch ass, yeah

Ayo, that's why they be killing us and shooting us
That's why they feel uncomfortable around us
'Cause of our greatness
You're lucky God made us compassionate
And forgiving
Pssh, man, they scared of us, Nas
We see that bitch in your eyes
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Beamers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square
Headed for Delaware with one change of gear
Nothing on my mind but the dime sack we blazed
With the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave
Dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print
Though I'm innocent 'til proven guilty
I'ma try to get filthy, purchase a club and start up a realty
For real G, I'ma fulfill my dream
If I conceal my scheme then precisely I'll build my cream
The first trip without the clique
Sent the bitch with the quarter brick, this is it
Fresh face, NY plates got a crooked eye for the Jakes
I want it all, ArmorAll Benz and endless papes
God sake, what a nigga got to do to make a half a million
Without the FBI catching feelings

Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Beamers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

From Fat Cat to Pappy, niggas see the cat
Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back
Holding gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back
Living with Moms, getting it on, flushing crack down the toilet
Two sips from being alcoholic
Nine hundred ninety nine thou from being rich
But now I'm all for it
My man saw it like Dionne Warwick
A wiser team, for a wiser dream we could all score with
The cartel Argentina coke with the nina
Up in the hotel, smoking on Sessamina
Trina got the fishscale between her
The way the bitch shook her ass yo the dogs never seen her
She got me back living sweeter, fresh Caesar
Guess, David Robinson's, Wally moccasins
Bitches blow me while hopping in the drop-top BM
Word is bond son, I had that bitch down on my shit like this

Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Beamers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

Growing up project-struck, looking for luck, dreaming
Scoping the large niggas beaming, check what I'm seeing
Cars, ghetto stars pushing ill Europeans
G'n, heard about them old timers OD'n
Young early 80's, throwing rocks at the crazy lady
Worshipping every word them rope-rocking niggas gave me
The street raised me up giving a fuck
I thought Jordans and a gold chain was living it up
I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts, everybody
Cut out of class, just to smoke blunts and drink noddy
Ain't that funny, getting put on to crack money
With all the gunplay, painting the kettle black hungry
A case of beers in the staircase I wasted years
Some niggas went for theirs, flipping coke as they career
But I'm a rebel stressing, to pull out of the heat no doubt
With Jeeps tinted out, spending never holding out

Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Beamers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Beamers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something
The ghetto Othello, the Moor
Oh my God, they speak venomous on the boy
Oh my Lord, my enemy is fear, and I'm sure
Oh my God, they want the end of me 'cause I'm pure
Oh my Lord, discipline for the win, I just go for it
It's a trend for these men to die on their own sword
Journey far, learn who you can be
But you can learn who you are when you around family
Chip off their shoulders and soldiers, on they grizzle
My granddaddy Mack Little married Nannie Little
They passed down wisdom, blessings were given
Pray my sins don't get passed to my children
I made a killin', I'm alive like the morning star
Court Jordan's for the price on stock, so what the Hornets are?
I need evaluations, I'm savvy, y'all
Eatin' foie gras and caviar, listen

Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree, ayy
Adam and Eve, Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree, apple tree

The ghosts of gangsters dance
Chinchillas shake on the hanger, the force of this banger
Yeah, my language advanced, my cadence amazin'
The voice triggers somethin', what is this conundrum?
The clouds scurry, your spirit rumble, a boyish smile
Still puff the loud, it's nothin' less than a quarter pound
Savage narrative, every verse that I write bursts light
Brings awareness to my personal life
After my morning walk, Havana cigar, the ganja spark
See my doctor more, sweat in the sauna or the spa
Spendin' fifty large at the Bellagio
Spent twenty on a bad bitch I hardly know
New girl every night, two girls was every other night
Sexual addiction, gangster tradition
They wanna fuck me, have me under they belt, slightly offended
Yeah, that's how I felt, that's how it ended
I'm just good at existin', existin' in my truth
As long as I enjoy the fruit, yeah

Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree, ayy
Adam and Eve, Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree, apple tree

What come first, peace or the paper?
Before I had a piece of paper, peace was in my favor
Before I sat to eat at the table, it had leeches and traitors
Cut the fat from the meat, extract the weak, bon appetit
No bacon, brothers is swine
It's so hard to trust 'em 'cause my hustle is mine
It's evident they all the same, with gray hair and still mean muggin'
Gray hairs of wisdom, that means you seen somethin'
Say somethin', you stay frontin'
But these clowns got false crowns, fictitional kings
You broke my heart, Fredo
You bring this thing of ours down to a fable
Be advised my guys dyin', enterprisin' at a boss's table
There's always room at my table
Insecurities is keepin' you disabled
All this money to get, is it less time?
They ain't stopped printin' money, 'cause they made mine
I learned to stretch time, these are the best times
I'm in my neighborhood in stadiums, the Mets' kind
With restaurants and Carbone, spicy rigatoni
Go hard, a red Bordeaux, oh God

Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree, ayy
Adam and Eve, Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree, apple tree
You cocked back
You thought you had it planned, you thought you had your man
He saw you coming, he ran when you tried to blast that man
You missed him by inches, he sprinted
Some of his boys on the corner was who your bullets entered
Two of 'em pull through but one didn't, son's finished
You took the life of him
The part about it that's crazy, you was aight with him
Tight with him, why was he in the way?
Why was he standing next to the enemy that specific day?
His style never hollas loud, stays reclusive
Good dude, got that look like he always about to do shit
Side of his mouth toothpick, one eyebrow raised
Got into it with dude who still tried to live out his old wild out days
They never had no probs
Somehow they rubbed each other wrong like a bad massage
These two different personalities had to collide
Niggas could not aim and innocent niggas died
You ask why, cause of a

Accident murderer, act like you killed on purpose
Liars brag, you put work in
You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin
Streets are full of 'em, read the bulletin
Accident murderer
You just an accident murderer

We grew up doing graffiti, now hollow heads getting heated
Seated in foreign cars, constantly getting weeded
Proceeded to count profits, I know they got on binoculars
But fuck em all, we balling 'til they come lock us up
20 to life; I'm clubbing, blowing 20 tonight
We the mob, Bob Marley Marlin' all through the night
Addicted to wealth, never cold turkey to war
Snatch a TEC off the shelf, live forever; that's Insh'Allah
Memoirs of a rich nigga
Sweat suits, gold chains, old drug dealers
New Benz, chrome rims are for show, killer
You niggas accidental, shoppers in back of the limo
Pay your tithes, stay alive, can't be dodging my clique
Cut a check; I use your bitch for some bargaining chips
In a hole, sell your home, nigga go sell your soul
This forty-five in control, God forgives and I don't

Accident murderer, act like you killed on purpose
Liars brag, you put work in
You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin
Streets are full of 'em, read the bulletin
Accident murderer
You just an accident murderer

Accident murderer
Accident murderer, you just an accident murderer

Yo, for my nigga that got killed, got hit up
Vodka spills on the concrete, light a swisha, we miss ya
And for that girl who never made it home, shot in the dome
How they gon' kill that beautiful sister?
Violent adolescents, homicidal with weapons
Not a lot of knowledge inside of they minds, that I'm guessing
Tell me who you impressing
Shooters I knew them when they was babies, I used to test them
Make em throw up they hands, choke 'em out playing wrestling
Watch em grow to a man, I see them now they repping
But they cold-blooded, homie, wondering where the respect went
Can't play with these little niggas, gangsta little niggas
Can't hang with these little niggas, they're killing, they're reckless
Wish I could build with him, but will he change really?
Some real killers, I think of Wayne Perry
Think of my nigga Drawz, but you aren't a name to me
You ain't mean to kill him, it wasn't necessary

Accident murderer, act like you killed on purpose
Liars brag, you put work in
You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin
Streets are full of em, read the bulletin
Accident murderer
You just an accident murderer
It's like a cold story.. repeated over and over..
In the winters of my mind
This shit be real, man..
Shit's crazy out here..
Yo yo, yo what up y'all?
That's my niggas over there, word

If you scared to take chances, you'll never have the answers
I could tell the future of a dude how his stance is
Wonder will he shoot then you should study where his hands is
Is he gon' cock it and pop it? His waistband big
But he don't have that thing in him, slangin just ain't in him
Body language is off, he's soft
But soft niggas all a sudden start dumpin', frontin'
Cause he feel a way: my niggas say the eyes is a giveaway
One look could tell me if you really came to kill me
Be the quiet nigga lookin' lame with the milli
Who that over there creepin'? Who homie by the tree?
Better safe than sorry, look at p-noid me
Few machine guns close, we could squeeze all three
Be a cold day in hell before they creep on me
It’s a lesson every premonition
Lot of niggas killed ‘cause they wasn't payin' attention, listen

I want a bitch I can trust, some niggas I can trust
Accountants lookin' over my figures I can trust
A lawyer that’s fightin' for my decisions I can trust
Damn my nigga, trust, I can never get enough
Or Rugers I can trust, shooters I can trust
Goons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust
And if I can't trust you, the fuck is you here for?
Some of you niggas’ true colors becomin' clear more

It’s been so long, can’t remember how we begun this war
This is a ever-lasting thunderstorm, cause guns went off
I see your moms, she still speak
She don’t know I ain’t cool with her son no more
It’s old shit, see forever we holdin' this grudge
Takes real men to squash beef, end it with hugs
We buried our dead, been years, why should I worry 'bout him?
Constantly watchin' my back, plus niggas tellin' I dread
Another day I put a family in black
Though I be calm and relaxed
Though I know somehow it will come back
Even if I’m in the right, ‘cause still a life is a life
What was it worth to see you covered in dirt?
It’s quite redundant, whether you the hunter or the hunted
Mothers cry, no statute of limitation on a homicide
Just tattoos of my niggas’ names
I wonder, will it change? Let’s ride…

I want a bitch I can trust, some niggas I can trust
Accountants lookin' over my figures I can trust
A lawyer that’s fightin' for my decisions I can trust
Damn my nigga, trust, I can never get enough
Or Rugers I can trust, shooters I can trust
Goons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust
And if I can't trust you, the fuck is you here for?
Some of you niggas’ true colors becomin' clear more

It’s rare I listen to niggas who never been in my position
A caterpillar can’t relate to what an eagle envisions
From the mind of a man who went at it with killers
Sit down, little man, let me school you in hood business
Seen a lot of niggas blow, lot of dreams folded
Some wasn’t humble, ate too much, got bloated
Ain’t too much left to buy, bought it, I’m loaded, I guess
Lear jets, I ask myself: do I need love or success?
They say the artist that truly suffers, his stuff is the best
‘Cause his heart bleed on his sleeve: pain, pistols and sex
Remember spray paintin' the word "fresh" and then starin' at it
Older folks angry, pointin', swearin' at it
Buildings I sprayed, nowadays drive the McLaren past it
Same old man from years ago told me life is short
So from infant to geriatric, trust your own judgment
Live with it and love it

I want a bitch I can trust, some niggas I can trust
Accountants lookin' over my figures I can trust
A lawyer that’s fightin' for my decisions I can trust
Damn my nigga, trust, I can never get enough
Or Rugers I can trust, shooters I can trust
Goons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust
And if I can't trust you, the fuck is you here for?
Some of you niggas’ true colors becomin' clear more
Hip hop, hip hop (Ugh!) is dead
(Had to flip this track again, y'all!)
Hip, hip hop, hip hop (Ugh!) is dead
Hip, hip hop (Ugh!)
Hip, hip hop is dead (NYC! Dirty South!)
Hip, hip hop (West Coast!)
Hip hop (Midwest!)
Hip hop (Let's go!)

If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll load an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
(Hip hop just died this morning
And she's dead, she's dead)

Yeah, niggas smoke, chill, party and die in the same corner
Get cash, live fast, body their man's mama
Quick fast, trigger fingers on the llama
Revenge in their eyes, Hennessy and the ganja
Word to the wise with villain state of minds
Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind
Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind
(Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind)
Whenever, if ever, I roll up, it's sown up
Any ghetto will tell ya, "Nas helped grow us up"
My face once graced promotional Sony trucks
Hundred million and billin', I helped blow 'em up
Gave my man my right, I could have went left
So like my girl Foxy, the kid went deaf
So people, who's your top 10? Is it MC Shan? Is it MC Ren?

If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll load an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
(Hip hop just died this morning
And she's dead, she's dead)

The bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin'
Come through, something ill, missing the ceilin'
What influenced my raps? Stick-ups and killings
Kidnappings, project buildings, drug dealings
Criticize that, why's that?
‘Cause Nas rap is compared to legitimized crap
‘Cause we love to talk on nasty chickens
Most intellectuals will only half listen
So you can't blame jazz musicians
Or David Stern with his NBA fashion issues
Oh, I think they like me, in my white tee
You can't ice me, we here for life, B
On my second marriage, hip hop's my first wifey
And for that, we not taking it lightly
If hip hop should die, we die together
Bodies in the morgue lie together, all together now

If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll load an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
(Hip hop just died this morning
And she's dead, she's dead)

Everybody sound the same, commercialize the game
Reminiscing when it wasn't all business
It forgot where it started
So we all gather here for the dearly departed
Hip-hopper since a toddler
One homeboy became a man, then a mobster
If it dies, let me get my last swig of vodka
RIP, we'll donate your lungs to a rasta
Went from turntables to MP3's
From "Beat Street"to commercials on Mickey D's
From gold cables to Jacobs
From plain facials to Botox and face lifts
I'm looking over my shoulder
It's about 80 people from my hood that showed up
And they came to show love
Sold out concert and the doors are closed shut
Woke up this mornin' (yeah)
You got yourself a gun (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Got yourself a gun

Yo, I'm livin' in this time behind enemy lines
So, I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You from the hood, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You want beef, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
And when I see you I'ma take what I want
So you tried to front, hope you (got yourself a gun)
You ain't real, hope you (got yourself a gun)

My first album had no famous guest appearances
The outcome: I'm crowned the best lyricist
Many years on this professional level
Why would you question who's better? The world is still mine
Tattoo's real, with "God's Son" across the belly, the boss of rap
You saw me in Belly with thoughts like that
To take it back to Africa, I did it with Biggie
Me and 2Pac were soldiers of the same struggle
You lames a huddle, your team's shook
Y'all feel the wrath of a killer, ‘cause this is my football field
Throwin' passes from a barrel, shoulder pads, apparel
But the QB don't stand for no quarterback
Every word is like a sawed-off blast 'cause y'all all soft
And I'm the black hearse that came to haul y'all ass in
It's for the hood by the corner store
Many try, many die, come at Nas if you want a war, get it bloody!

Yo, I'm livin' in this time behind enemy lines
So, I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You from the hood, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You want beef, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
And when I see you I'ma take what I want
So you tried to front, hope you (got yourself a gun)
You ain't real, hope you (got yourself a gun)

Yo, I'm the N, the A to the S-I-R
And if I wasn't, I must've been Escobar
You know the kid got his chipped tooth fixed
Hair parted with a, barber's preciseness
Bravehearted for life, it's
The return of the Golden Child, son of a blues player
So who are you, player? Y'all awaited the true savior
Puffin' that tropical, cups of that vodka, too
Papi chu', tore up, wake up in a hospital
Throw up? Never! 'Member I do this through righteous steps
You Judas thought I was gone, so in light of my death
Y'all been all happy-go-lucky, bunch of sambos
Call me "God's Son" with my pants low
I don't die slow, put them rags up like Petey Pablo
This is NASDAQ though, in my Nascar, with this Nas flow
What could beat that? Not a soul reppin'
Hit the record store, never let me go, get my whole collection, yo

Yo, I'm livin' in this time behind enemy lines
So, I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You from the hood, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You want beef, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
And when I see you I'ma take what I want
So you tried to front, hope you (got yourself a gun)
You ain't real, hope you (got yourself a gun)

It's, the, return of the prince, the boss
This is real hardcore, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit soft
Sip Cris', get chips, wrist glist' – I floss
Stick-shift look sick up in that Boxster Porsche
With the top cut off, rich kids go and cop The Source
They don't know about the blocks I'm on
And everybody wanna know where the kid go
Where he rest at, where he shop at and dress at
Know he got dough, where does he live? Is he still in the Bridge?
Does he really know how ill that he is?
Got all of y'all watchin' my moves, my watch and my jewels
Hop in my coupe, dodge interviews like that
It's not only my jewels, ice anything, plenty chains
Look at my tennis shoes, I iced that
Who am I? The back twister, lingerie ripper
Automatic leg-spreader, quicker brain-getter
Keepin' it gangsta with ya (uhh)

Yo, I'm livin' in this time behind enemy lines
So, I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You from the hood, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You want beef, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
And when I see you I'ma take what I want
So you tried to front, hope you (got yourself a gun)
You ain't real, hope you (got yourself a gun)
The cops used to come around in my neighborhood
"Alright, you kids, stop having so much fun, move along!"
Oh they'd arrest me, you know, especially at night
They had a curfew, niggas had to be home at 11, negros, 12
And you'd be trying to get home, doing your crew runs
And they'd always catch you out in front of a store or something
'Cause you'd be taking shortcuts, right
Cops, "Ree, put your hands up, black boy!"

The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid

I don't wanna hurt nobody
We just came here to party
See a few dames, exchange some names
I'm a top shotta, kid, stay in your lane
The cop shot the kid, same old scene
Pour out a little liquor, champagne for pain
Slap-boxin' in the street
Crack the hydrant in the heat
Cop cars on the creep
Doin' they round-ups, we just watch for the sweep
Yeah, it's hotter than July
It's the summer when niggas die
It's the summer when niggas ride
Together we'll be strong, but forever we divide
So y'all are blowin' my high
Type of shit that's killin' my vibe
White kids are brought in alive
Black kids get hit with like five
Get scared, you panic, you're goin' down
The disadvantages of the brown
How in the hell the parents gon' bury their own kids
Not the other way around?
Reminds me of Emmett Till
Let's remind 'em why Kap kneels

The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
I still hear him scream

Stay tuned up and down your timeline
This fake news, people is all lyin'
Money is bein' made when a mom cries
Won't be satisfied 'til we all die
Tell me, who do we call to report crime
If 9-1-1 doin' the driveby?
It's certain things I can't abide by
I ain't bein' extreme, this is my side
Talkin' big shit, ready to die
I know every story got two sides
Claimin' he paranoid by the black guy
Cop wanna make it home by nighttime
Just a good kid, he wasn't that guy
Had a little hit, he wasn't that high
Cop gon' claim that it was self-defense
Say he was ridin' dirty so the case rests

The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot– (workin' nine-to-five)
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot– (tryna stay alive)
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot– (makin' ends meet)
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot– (shot him this week)
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
I still hear him scream
Oooooh-ooooh-oooooooh
42nd Street Terminal


Yo, yo, I live it and I speak it, my religion is reefer
Big money and the most uninhibited freak to sleep with
My visions are realistic, nothing is figurative
I can wish it into existence, God want this nigga to live
Blunt big as a dread, I get high and forget who bled
Who we stomp-kicked in the head and who we left for dead
Who are you niggas? Why argue niggas?
The truth is the truth, I really put my scars on niggas
They wear them lifetime, they tell they hoes, Nas did this
Pointing to they scars like, right here, baby, really Nas did this
Like a badge of honor, not bragging I'm just honest
War stories we tell them, nothing's realer than karma
Sip prohibition liquor, prohibition whiskey
Rap Jack Dempsey, matte black Bentley, pimply
Shattering your silence, passing round the chalice
Due to my Indian ancestry at the weed dispensery
Official kings and gents is who I mix and mingle with
Fuck your ice, I rock rubies, amethyst
I'll fuck your wife 'cause she a groupie, scandalous
This for my bad hood bitches, ghetto glamorous

Yo, what we talking 'bout niggas?
What we talking 'bout niggas?
This is Nas, what, Nas
What, Nasty, what, recollect motherfucker

Uhh, uhh, uhh
At seventeen I made seventeen thousand living in public housing
Integrity intact, repping hard
They asking how he disappear and reappear back on top
Saying Nas must have naked pictures of God or something
To keep winning is my way like Francis
As long as I'm breathing, I'll take chances
A soldier coming home, twenty years old with no legs
Sayin' there's no sense to cry and complain, just go 'head
So much to write and say, yo I don't know where to start
So I'll begin with the basics and flow from the heart
I know you think my life is good 'cause my diamond piece
But my life been good since I started finding peace
I shouldn't even be smiling, I should be angry and depressed
I been rich longer than I been broke, I confess
I started out broke, got rich, lost paper then made it back
Like Trump being up down up, play with cash, huh

My nigga's like a locomotive
Nas, we pushed it, mush it
Queensbridge to Bushwick
Harlem, Bronx, all that
You ain't even supposed to be here
You know where you at?

At night, New York, eat a slice too hot
Use my tongue to tear the skin hanging from the roof of my mouth
Shit was felicissimo melting pot, city sweltering hot
Staggering, drunker than those cops that 2Pac shot
I was a crook by the train with that iron thing, concealed reaching
Soon as I heard them iron wheels screeching
When it came to a halt whoever walked off got caught
Token man safe behind a locked door for sure
Minor thief shit, minor league shit, beasting
Looking for the juks young, but now we older chiefing
In my truck, play The Greatest Adventures of Slick Rick
Bugging on how his imagination was so sick
It's ghetto beef, sinister niggas snicker through yellow teeth
Alcohol aging my niggas faster than felonies
How dare I, must be, something in the air that corrupts me
Look at my upkeep, owned and sublease
I'm here y'all

This for my trapped in the 90s niggas
For my trapped in the 90s niggas
Ha for y'all niggas
Uhh, uhh, uhh

Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a ginsu
Look at the life that I've been through
I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a ginsu
Look at the life that I've been through (uhh)
I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official

Y'all don't know about my Biggie wars
Who you thought "Kick in the Door" was for?
But that's my heart, y'all still trippin' off the Jigga shit
Real niggas listen up and I'ma tell you how the whole thing start
Off top I brung Queens up from hard times
Rockin' at the Fever, streets was all mine
It was my version of the blues, droppin' out schools
The crack epidemic had rap representin' the rules
So I got in them shoes, tried 'em, wore them
Wasn't a perfect fit so I couldn't sport 'em
Young murderers ride, I knew all them
Jungle got shot, Will died, we was warrin'
I wrote it in my album
I was 18 when Lake seen the Island, and Lord held me down and
My surroundings started changin', I had a baby
I was makin' my rounds with AZ
Niggas started noticin' my flow and was open when
The Golden Child closed 'em in
With more style than them older men
Puff tried to start a label, Prince Rakeem had formed Wu-Tang
Snoop and Dre had a new thing
So Puff drove his new Range through Queensbridge Projects
He let me drive it, before Ready to Die hit
Big and I hit blunts performin' at the Ark
Next thing you knew, Big blew and all the ballin' starts
He had Kim in his crew, I found Fox
Only niggas in New York with number one charts
Big was ahead of his time, him and Raekwon
My niggas; but dig it, they couldn't get along
That's when Ghostface said it on The Purple Tape
Bad Boy bitin' Nas album cover, wait
Big told me Rae was stealin' my slang
And Rae told me, out in Shaolin, Big would do the same thing
But I borrowed from both them niggas
Jigga started to flow like us, but hit with "Ain't No Niggas"
Had much Versace swagger
Big admired the Brooklynite and took him in as Iceberg the rapper
Today, don't know nothin' about this boss shit
There's more shit than wantin' to be this King of New York shit
Uhh, uhh, uhh

Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a ginsu
Look at the life that I've been through
I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a ginsu (uhh)
Look at the life that I've been through (yeah)
I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official

Rap became a version of Malcom and Martin
Rest in peace Will, Queensbridge live on
There's some ghetto secrets I can't rhyme in this song
There's some missing pieces I had to leave out
Had lost trust for Steve Stoute at some point 'til I got to know him
We old friends, but what's loyal?
Puff soaked Interscope offices with champagne bottles on Steve
And Steve thought the drama's on me
'Cause previously it would've been, against whoever
Friends forever
However, I learn, with some niggas it's all business
But I'm a street dude with morals
Then this nigga's with Jigga too much
He used to say Jay wanted my spot
I laughed, stayed home, never hung a lot
A quiet man who used to be alone plannin'
Baby moms thought I was too quiet, couldn't stand it
She hit the streets, later on she hittin' the sheets
With a rapper who wanted me on his songs, thinkin' he strong
I taught her how to watch for cars who might follow
Taught her street shit that I know
Her weakness was shine yo
But that's her, I ain't mad, baby, it made me stronger
Now I get my paper longer
Illmatic I was boss, It Was Written I flossed
One of the most creative LP's ever to hit stores
In the Firm I learned I Am NaStradamus
QB's Finest, Oochie Wally, faced more problems
I gave it all up so I can chill at home with Mama
She was gettin' old and sick so I stayed beside her
We had the best times, she asked would I make more songs
I told her not 'til I see her health get more strong
In the middle of that, Jay tried to sneak attack
Assassinate my character, degrade my hood
'Cause in order for him to be the Don, Nas had to go
The Gam-B-I-N-O rules I understood
What y'all want, see, I already had
The Gift and The Curse? Fuck that shit, the first you'll be last
I'm the man's man, a rapper's rapper
G-O-D, S-O-N – they'll be none after
I was Scarface, Jay was Manolo
It hurt me when I had to kill him and his whole squad for dolo...
Uhh, uhh, uhh

Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a ginsu
Look at the life that I've been through
I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a ginsu
Look at the life that I've been through
I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official
Yeah, Harlem, Bronx, Brooklyn

Let's make a bet, I know the reason you ain't make it yet
Your stage was set, but you ain't see the tedious ingredients
That go inside of a rider, you hiding from problems and
You never knew how to make dollars
You couldn't make orders at a drive-through McDonald's
I was fly at the Apollo with Black Jason, '89 with a bottle
Niggas jealous of Jason, dark green seven forty, no tint
Rollie on wrist, gleaming, he rock the baldy
Used to ride with him to Brooklyn, Lewis and Halsey
Cop chocolate Thai, Vernon style and burn it down
My nigga Hype in the federal joint, verdict out
Twenty years getting money in the Dirty South
That's alleged, you see my nigga's a stand up dude
So I'm yelling, "Free my nigga!"
My nephew godfather Malik, he jammed up too
For what his hands usually call for, but he ain't do it

Who you are ain't in the recipe of what I am
'Cause where I'm from
Man, what I see, you wouldn't understand
Where I been and what I do
No matter how you try you never can
'Cause where I'm from
And what I see, you wouldn't understand
Where I been, where I been

You ever been on the other end of a robber's revolver?
Not me, call me Lucky Nas Castellana
Or been shot in the medulla oblongata
And survived and praise God with a bullet I never collided
Some did and they lived, I salute the gods
Moët spilling, splashed by mistake on my Timb boots for y'all
N.Y. nigga, Adidas, jogging suit
Shelltoes, slim, fly nigga
Hudson River, rent a boat, t-shirt with a dinner coat
A vintage Fila like I'm the ghost of Domencio
On any day getting throat in a tinted vehicle
Like a old BK gangsta, but I'm the CEO
Of Nasty Nas Enterprises, mastermind, made men
My success symbolizes loyalty, great friends
Dedication, hard work, routine builds character
In a world full of snakes, rats and scavengers
Never make choices out of desperation, I think through it
Break through walls like Pink Floyd, and drink fluids
Of all kind of alcohol, y'all
Vineyards in France, yachts out in Cannes

Who you are ain't in the recipe of what I am
'Cause where I'm from
Man, what I see, you wouldn't understand
Where I been and what I do
No matter how you try you never can
'Cause where I'm from
And what I see, you wouldn't understand
Where I been, where I been

Now holla at a millionaire
Rollie, Hublot and Audemar, deciding which one to wear
Who to screw, what to drive
550 with the cream guts inside
Or the Super Sport Range truck is fly
Diamond ring on my knuckles, like fire, bitch
Gats on us, I don't really trust these guys
Spend a couple bucks a night on bottles on cuties
If she beautiful, the lustful type, I'll hit it and bust inside
Fuck it, I'ma die one day
They gon' probably make that day a holiday
Until then, let's go on a shopping spree
Speaking for my real niggas
Only OG's, certified who kill niggas
When put in that seat, but tonight we on chill, nigga
Chill mode, spill more Spades
Listen to Yeezy and Hov, some Rozay
It's like we always on the grind with no brakes
So tonight we gon' act like we on vacation with this on rotation

Who you are ain't in the recipe of what I am (word)
'Cause where I'm from (yeah)
Man, what I see you wouldn't understand
Where I been and what I do
(Y'all wouldn't understand, huh)
No matter how you try you never can
(You wouldn't last a day in my shoes, homie)
'Cause where I'm from (yeah)
And what I see, you wouldn't understand
Where I been, where I been

True B nigga, yeah, uhh
For my hood niggas, yeah, yeah
To my man Eric B, what up, yeah
The whole city, I see you
To my man Big Slate in the fed joint
My man Spunk, free my niggas
All my niggas, yeah
Club Vernon, I see you, I see you, yeah
And Baltum, I see you
Rest in peace to Black Just
Riding through Jamaica Queens in his black truck
Timbs was forty below, waves to the side of his dome
Definition of good nigga, yo
Gangsters don't die, niggas only become immortal
Angels don't only fly, they walk right before you
In front of you
It’s foul what this money could do
Cash corrupts the loyal
I hung with E-Money too, the fucking truth
Fucking with Stretch from Live Squad
I could’ve died the same night that Stretch died
I just got out of his ride
He dropped me off and drove to Springfield
November 30th, another Queens king killed
It fucked me up, y’all
I was just trying to make it with Steve Stoute
The legal way, drug-free route
Back in the days, they was sleeping on us
Brooklyn keep on taking it, Manhattan keep on making it
Trying to leave Queens out
But we was pulling them Beems out, them M3's out
Pumping bringing them D's out
Rastas selling chocolate weed inside of a weed house
Colosseum downstairs, gold teeth mouth
Astoria warriors, eight street, twin buildings
Vernon, can’t even count the Livingston children
Justice in Ravenswood, nice neighborhood
Caught sleeping out there, be a wrap though
Bridge niggas be up in Petey’s ten racks, yo
A simple bet on a serious cash flow
Get money, Manolo, welcome home Castro
Queensbridge unified all I ask for
Let's do it for DU, say what up to Snacks, yo
I just salute real niggas when I pass through, uhh...

Niggas is very hungry for that bank robbery
Bury money, trying to get to a Benz from a Hyundai
The Queens Courthouse right next to the cemetery
Niggas' rap sheets look like obituaries
You be starving in Kew Gardens
Bolognas and milk from a small carton
You could still feel chills from the team on 118
My nigga Bim fly by like it's a dream
His face on his Shirt Kings
Laced in a pinky ring, in his black Benz murking
Back when Black Rock and Ron was on the map
Cheeba in yellow sacks, dope sold in laundromats
Thugs bark, getting amped from weed
Over the heart of champions, see
Ever since back then, a nigga been about the dough
(You all know how the story GO!)

"Any other real niggas in the world besides us?" I ask
Probably is, but odds are we’ll never cross paths
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell a story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This how we do, I see you DU
Queens to the heavens, salute the hood legends
Crack the Patrón, Hennessy and Glenlivets
Champagne bottles drowning out the sorrows
Hope the memories'll get us through tomorrow
I’m a real OG cause back in '93
Niggas couldn't fuck with me, sipping 'gnac since I was little
Laid back in a rental
Mouth shining, Eddie’s gold caps all up in the dental
Nigga getting money now
But you know I'm still mental but not simple
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell your story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This for the fallen soldiers, hold it down, I told you
Pop another bottle and keep the smoke rolling

Watch the calm realest channel his mom's spirit
Goosebumps cover me, mother's here, I could feel her
Blood of Christ covers me, our savior and healer
Drug prices up or down, I know a few dealers
And some accident murderers, they act like they killed on purpose
Liars brag they put work in
You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin
Better stay on point, if not it's curtains
Bebo Posse reincarnated through me probably
If music money didn’t stop me
I never claimed to be the toughest
Though I'm to blame for a few faces reconstructed
It's the game that we was stuck with
Now I'm the only black in the club with rich Yuppie kids
Sad thing, this is the top, but where the hustlers went
No familiar faces around, ain't gotta grab the musket
It's all safe and sound, champagne by the bucket
Where them niggas I shouted out on my first shit
Bo cooking blow, fuck is Slate at? Where Turkey went?
Old videos show niggas that was murdered since
Another reason to get further bent
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell your story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This for the fallen soldiers, hold it down, I told you
Pop another bottle and keep the smoke rolling
Lies and the pain
Betrayal; life

In danger’s face
Look what you’re facing, gave your heart away
And all the remedies couldn’t ease the pain
All the hurt and betrayal; need to get away
In a world so cold
You gain your life just to lose your soul
Never thinking twice bout what the future holds
All the lies and the games not worth fighting for

The world is an addiction
Serving up a fix
The world is an addiction
It's way too much for me

Snitches and rapists in the street, crime to the fullest
Asking niggas if they got any extra nine bullets
They deny me that, they know the bullets they loan me
Be the same ones that probably had them lying flat
Stretched out, letter T, it's better to dead a beef
Than let it breathe, then we don't succeed
Cause then you gotta murder dummies
Waste your time, they allergic to money
I'm never squirmish to blood
We can thug and get out of hand; what’s the options?
Only conclusion is shooting, bullets popping, hoodlums dropping
Fear any day that the feds will come knocking
Was young and nervous, asking myself what’s my purpose?
In the back of a paddy wagon, bracelets aching me
Pigs ignoring, I'm asking what precinct they taking me
These cops can’t relate to me, death to prison, empty vacancy

The world is an addiction
Serving up a fix
The world is an addiction
It's way too much for me

Thou shall not be selfish, real nigga commandments
Know a billionaire, he has everything but a fam
Guess how angry this man gets
Had so many bad chicks in his bed, strange sex, same sex
Has addictions that are sadistic, chain of events, habits
He puts cocaine on his prick and acts sick
Self-esteem needs boosting, alcohol consumption
Nicotine fusion, some athletes juicing
Pastors quote biblical chapters, Psalms
All along he’s into bestiality porn
And it’s wrong, so I keep the Cali weed in the bong
And I'm strong but the female anatomy got me sprung
And these women need shoes and baddest cars and condos
Fine clothes and these fiends needs to get high
So they find dough to mainline dope, and y'all know

The world is an addiction
Serving up a fix
The world is an addiction
It's way too much for me

So many vices, habits, mine of course, bad chicks
My response to any advice on what is the essentials of life
I'm just rebellious, not selfish
Guess we all share different definitions of what wealth is
I need the best things in life, that's women, that’s cars, cigars
A vintage bottle on ice that’s priceless
The other night, just in the emergency room
A patient said she needs to see a doctor soon
Doctor busy operating on a lady who's sedated
He can barely concentrate cause he’s newly separated
His estranged wife likes entertaining her acquaintance
In the house they were married in, mad people waiting
Some young some old, heads and stomachs aching
Filling out an application cause they all need medication
But the doctor need love or a quick vacation
Calling up his travel agent, same time, premeditating
Murdering his ex wife; life, savage ain't it
Some need Xanax just to maintain it
We all need faith cause the world keep changing
Let go of the illusion, start some restraining

Oooooooooooh-ahhhhhhhhh....
Ahhhhhhhh-ahhhhhh-ahhhhhh...ahhh..
Just hold on (just hold on)
Just hold on (just hold on)
Just hold on (just hold on)
Just hold on (just hold on)
Just hold on (just hold on)
Just hold on (just hold on)
Just hold on (just hold on)
Just hold on (... hold on)
Uh uh, yo
They plan was to knock me out the top of the game
But I overstand they truth is all lame
I hold cannons that shoot balls of flame
Right in they fat mouth then I carve my name
Nas – too real, Nas – true king
It's however you feel, go 'head, you swing
Your arms too short to box with God
I don't kill soloists, only kill squads
Fame went to they head, so now it's "Fuck Nas"
Yesterday you begged for a deal, today you tough guys
I seen it coming
Soon as I popped my first bottle
I spotted my enemies tryna do what I do
Came in with my style, so I fathered you
I kept changing on the world since "... Barbeque"
Now you wanna hang with niggas I hung with
Fuck bitches I hit, it's funny I once said
If I, ever make a record, I take a cheque
And put something away for a rainy day to make my exit
But look at me now, ten years deep
Since the project bench with crack in my sock, asleep
I never asked to be top of rap's elite
Just a ghetto child tryna learn the traps of the streets
But look at me now

You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man

Now wait a sec', give me time to explain, women and fast cars
And diamond rings can poison a rap star
Was suicidal, high, smoking so much lye
I saw a dead bird flying through a broken sky
Wish I could flap wings and fly away
To where black kings in Ghana stay
So I could get old, my flesh rot away
But that'll be the day when it's peace
When my gat don't need to spray
When these streets are safe to play
Sex with death, indulge in these women
Vision my own skeleton swimming in eternal fire
Broads play with pentagrams in they vagina
Like the Exorcist, then they gave birth to my seeds
I beg for God's help, why they love hurting me?
I'm your disciple, a thug certainly
I'm the N, the A to the S-I-R
If I wasn't, I must've been Escobar
.45 in my waist, staring at my reflection
In the mirror, sitting still in the chair like Mike Concepcion
When everything around me got cloudy
The chair became a king's throne, my destiny found me
It was clear why the struggle was so painful
Metamorphosis, this is what I changed to
And God, I'm so thankful

You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
Yeah..

Ayo, it's poison: ecstasy, coke, you say it's love, it is poison
Schools where I learned, they should be burned, it is poison
Physicians prescriptin' us medicine which is poison
Doctors injectin' our infants with the poison
Religion misoverstood is poison
Niggas up in my hood be gettin' shot, given poison

In hospitals, shots riddle the block, little
Children and elderly women run for they lives
Drizzlin' rain come out the sky every time somebody dies
Must be out my fuckin' mind, what is this, the hundredth time?
Sendin' flowers to funerals, readin' Rest In Peace
You know, the usual, death comes in threes
"Life is short" is what some nigga said
Not if you measure life by how one lives and what he did
And funny how these black-killer companies is makin' money off us
Fast food, Cola, soda, Skull and Bone crosses – it's all poison

Ecstasy, coke, you say it's love, it is poison
Schools where I learned, they should be burned, it is poison
Physicians prescriptin' us medicine which is poison
Doctors injectin' our infants with the poison
Religion misoverstood is poison
Sisters up in my hood try to do good given choices

When pregnant, drop out of school or have abortions
Stop workin', hopin' that they find a man that will support them
Up late night, on they mother's cordless
Thinkin' a perm or bleachin' cream will make them better, when they're gorgeous
White girls tannin', liposuction
Fake titties are implanted, fake lips, that's life destruction
Light-skinned women, bi-racial
Hateful toward themselves, denyin' even their blood
I don't judge Tiger Woods
But I overstand the mental poison that's even worser than drugs

Yo, it's poison: ecstasy, coke, you say it's love, it is poison
Schools where I learned, they should be burned, it is poison
Physicians prescriptin' us medicine which is poison
Doctors injectin' our infants with the poison
Religion misoverstood is poison
Radio and TV poison, white Jesus poison
And any thoughts of takin' me down is poison
Who want beef now? My heat shall anoint 'em, PLAOW!

Never to worry, all the wrong-doers got it coming back to 'em a thousand times over
Every dog has its day, and everything flips around
Even the most greatest nation in the world has it coming back to 'em
Everybody reaps what they sews, that's how it goes
Innocent lives will be taken
It may get worse, but we'll get through it, y'all, be strong!

The China-men built the railroad, the Indians saved the Pilgrim
And in return the Pilgrim killed 'em
They call it Thanksgiving, I call your holiday "hell-day"
‘Cause I'm from poverty, neglected by the wealthy
Me and my niggas share gifts every day like Christmas
Slay bitches, and party everyday like this is the last
I'm with my heckles, connectin' and we hittin' the lab
This is my level, fuck if it get you mad

It's all poison: all of my words to enemies, it is poison
Rappers only talk about ki's, it's all poison
How could you call yourself MCs? You ain't poison
Think about the kids you mislead with the poison
And any thoughts of takin' me down is all poison
Who want beef now? My heat shall anoint 'em, plaow!

What goes around comes around, my nigga
And what goes up, it must come down, my nigga
The soldiers found below the ground, my nigga
Just hold it down, we older now, my nigga

This nigga Ike with the Iverson jersey, light-skinned with herpes
Fuckin' sisters in Harlem, Brooklyn and D.C.
This is the problem, ‘cause he never tell 'em he got it
From lettin' fags suck him off, Rikers Island in '93
Drives a Benz, hangs at all the parties
All the concerts, backstage where the stars be
Rockin' they shirts in bitches faces like clockwork
What's your name? Where you from?
Chain blingin', thinkin' girls everywhere is dumb
Takin' pride in ruinin' their lives
So they could never have babies and they could never be wives
He never used a condom; give him head? He got ya
Met the wrong bitch and now he dead from the monster AIDS
I contemplate, believin' in karma
Those on top could just break and won't be eatin' tomorrow
I know some bitches who be sleepin' on a nigga's dreams
They leave; when that nigga blow, she the first bitch on her knees
Knowin' dudes that's neglectin' their seeds
Instead of takin' care of 'em they're spendin' money on trees
I pray for you, deadbeat daddies
Cause when them kids get grown
It's too late for you: now you old and you gettin' shitted on
It's all scientific, mystic, you know, the Earth and the stars
Don't hesitate to say you heard it from Nas
What is destined shall be
George Bush-killer 'til George Bush kills me
Much blessings, be healthy, remember:

What goes around comes around, my nigga
And what goes up, it must come down, my nigga
The soldiers found below the ground, my nigga
Just hold it down, we older now, my nigga
Just like a rose
Everybody knows that you are so beautiful
But I feel a thorn on my hide
I should've known
We can't repair what we broke
But I held you close, too close
I should've left your roses at the door
They're sharper than before
And I don't want them no more
I should've left your roses at the door
They're sharper than before
And I don't need them no more

I have no time to give you guidance
Barely have any fuck time either
Hefner minded like I think you're fine, but
I seen the finest women that ever came out a beaver
Mind reader, can tell she vegan or not when I meet her
Or if she insecure, most are
If she's mixed, a possible psycho alert goes off
Not a judge, cause a judge don't wear no draws, yet he allows
Everything to go to your spouse when you end your vows
My tax bracket, not enough blacks have it
Who should I date -- Project chick or Cuban actress?
A White chick, they might flip talking that Blackness
Should only attract Black shit, I'm an ass magnet
If you mad at that, you'll be mad forever
Never played you, I prayed we would stay together
Wished it'd last forever, know what I mean
Heard you tear a rose from the roots, the rose screams

Just like a rose
Everybody knows that you are so beautiful
But I feel a thorn on my hide
I should've known
We can't repair what we broke
But I held you close, too close

Them Xanax can't manage your maniac manic depressive expressions
They some silent killers, that stress shit
That put ulcers in a lot of niggas
I'm blowing medical, it helps chill a violent temper
I done went to hell and back, you always think you right
You know when you wrong, and still you want to fight
When people like my song, you want to kill 'em, right?
You resent me every time I make a million, right?
You want to experience life when you calling all the shots
Ordering bottles for all your girls up in the spot
Have your own cash, own your own Benz
Your own house, everything, me I understand
Thought you would bask in the glory as Queen Bee
Put you on under Martin Scorsese: Mean Street
The first movie he made, thought that was fly
I thought you was flyer, you a fucking liar

Just like a rose
Everybody knows that you are so beautiful
But I feel a thorn on my hide
I should've known
We can't repair what we broke
But I held you close, too close
I should've left your roses at the door
They're sharper than before
And I don't want them no more
I should've left your roses at the door
They're sharper than before
And I don't need them no more
Light it, uhh
Light it up, uhh

The whole city is mine, prettiest Don
I don't like the way P. Diddy did Shyne with different lawyers
Why it's mentioned in my rhymes? Fuck it
It's just an intro, hate it or love it, like it, bump it or dump it
Write it, across the stomach spell "God son"
Life is like a jungle, black, it's like the habitat of Tarzan
Matter of fact it's harder than most can imagine
Most of my niggas packed in correctional facilities
Half of them passed on, Mack strong, couple of shots
Made the ghost leave a body, now they hauntin' the block
Where they used to stand at, somebody's takin' they place
A younger man perhaps, hand slaps, can't understand that
Same walk, same talk, I wonder can that be possible?
A thug dies, another step inside his shoes
And they will hurt you, layin' low with a bottle
I'm blowin' circles, my state of mind purple

Light it, light it, uhh
Yeah… light it up
Light it up, uhh

Y'all just wanna deal with drama
Talk about niggas who got things, y'all ready to kill his mama
Everything you into is underworld related
You sell your man out, not even your girl is sacred
You don't trust a soul, hold up, you moldin' soldiers
To pull guns quick and always look behind the shoulder
Think of how many dudes died tryna be down with you
Everybody's under six feet of ground but you
Still standin', still roamin' through the streets, that's real
You a survivor, knowin' all the beef is ill
You got a bunch of thugs with you even now that's ready
Trustin' your judgment, quick to put it down, they deadly
The hood love you, but behind your back they pray for the day
A bullet hit your heart and ambulances take you away
That ain't love, it's hate, think of all the mothers at wakes
Whose sons you killed and you ain't got a cut on your face?
Unmarked police cars roam the streets hard, the heat is God
Somebody tell these shorties reach for the stars
Instead they tell 'em how to reach through the bars holdin' a mirror
Lookin' down a tear in jail, makin' weapons to kill ya
Weed smoke, three tokes, nigga, pour more Henny
He sighs with eyes that seen a war too many
Cold-blooded murderers, universal
Hood to hood, blowin' smoke, state of mind is purple

Light it up, light it up, light it up, uhh
Light it up… light it up, light it up, uhh
Uhh… uhh, uhh, light it, light it, uhh

These hot-headed youngsters always get into trouble
Reactin' before thinkin', they easily irritated
And murder's premeditated, it's a fact that we sinkin'
When we should be climbin', in a nutshell, it's just jail, drug sales, liquor and diamonds, niggas rewindin'
Instead of movin' forward to blow up, so what's the science?
People shoutin', police pushin' the crowd
And on the ground's a young soldier with meat hangin' out him
Am I hallucinatin' off the hazin'?
Or did I just see a nigga shoot another nigga's face in?
It's a ugly nation, cops circle the block with mug shots
Photograph pictures of suspect faces
It's usually two or three niggas who innocent
But if they lock the wrong ones up, then someone'll snitch
A divide-and-fall strategy, they aren't fair
I dig in my bag of weed that's covered with orange hair
This Color Purple, will make Whoopi give me the pussy
And Celie, Oprah and Danny Glover gots to feel me
This is how I escape the madness
Too much of anything'll hurt you, so my state of mind's all purple
QB… where the fuck y'all at?
Ha… yeah, let's go!
Gets money!

Chain gleamin', switchin' lanes, two-seater
Hate him or love him for the same reason (fresh)
Can't leave it, the game needs him
Plus the people need someone to believe in (yes)
So in God's Son we trust
'Cause they know I'ma give 'em what they want
They lookin' for a (hero)
I guess that makes me a (hero)

Another chapter of the cleanest rapper, distinguished gentlemen
Crooks & Castle on his back, Maybacher
Exotic lady eye-catcher, holla at ya, call me the chiropractor
Workin' like Muay Thai class, get perspire out ya
And of course I've been the boss since back when
Rockin' D Boy, Fila velour in one-ninety black Benz
Now they shut down the stores when I'm shoppin'
Used to be train robbin', face covered in stockin'—I'm him

Chain gleamin', switchin' lanes, two-seater
Hate him or love him for the same reason (fresh)
Can't leave it, the game needs him
Plus the people need someone to believe in (yes)
So in God's Son we trust
'Cause they know I'ma give 'em what they want
They lookin' for a (hero)
I guess that makes me a (hero)

Rubber-grip-holder, reloader
Come at me, I'ma rip your soliders in half
Silverback ape, nickel-plated mag
Young, rich and flashy; young bitch, I'm nasty
All black clothes 'til ice lay on me so classy
And every time I close my lids
I can still see the borough, I can still see the Bridge
I can still see the dreams that my niggas ain't never lived to see
Tell them angels open the door for me
From nine Berettas and movin' raw
To chillin' in wine cellars, sticks and humidors
That's what I call mature
That's what I call a G, that's what I call a pimp
That's what I call a gangsta, to the fullest, shit
I try to make more cream
By every September 14th, that's my dream
So I can be more clean, as I grow yearly
I can see things more clearly, that's why they fear me (let's go!)

Chain gleamin', switchin' lanes, two-seater
Hate him or love him for the same reason (fresh)
Can't leave it, the game needs him
Plus the people need someone to believe in (yes)
So in God's Son we trust
'Cause they know I'ma give 'em what they want

This universal apartheid, I'm hog-tied, the corporate side
Blockin' y'all from goin' to stores and buyin' it
First L.A. and Doug Morris was ridin' with it
But Newsweek article startled big wigs
They said "Nas, why is he tryin' it?"
My lawyers only see the Billboard charts as winnin'
Forgettin' Nas the only true rebel since the beginnin'
Still in musical prison, in jail for the flow
Try tellin' Bob Dylan, Bruce or Billy Joel
They can't sing what's in their soul
So "Untitled" it is
I never change nothin', but people remember this
If Nas can't say it, think about these talented kids
With new ideas bein' told what they can and can't spit
I can't sit and watch it, so shit, I'ma drop it
Like it or not, you ain't gotta cop it
I'm a hustler in the studio, cups of Don Julio
No matter what the CD called, I'm unbeatable y'all, let's go!

Yeah, Nas, Polow da Don
I know you can feel the magic, baby
Turn the motherfuckin' lights down
Esco, whattup? (Whattup, homie?)
I mean, it's what you expected, ain't it? (Hahaha)
Let's go... uhh, uh, uhh, uh, uhh, uh
Turn the music up in the headphones
Uh, yeah, that's perfect (yeah, right, right)
Uhh, uh, you gotta take ya time, make a nigga wait on this muh'fucka (hahaha!)
Make niggas mad and shit like
Niggas usually just start rappin' after four bars, nigga, go in!
Just start dancin' in this muh'fucka
Yeah, (yeah) we just come outta nowhere

I feel like a black republican, money I got comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him (nah)
Probably end up back in the hood, like, "Fuck it then"

Huddlin' over the oven, we was like brothers then (what?)
Though you was nothin' other than a son of my mother's friend
We had covenant, who would've thought the love would end?
Like Ice Cold's album (uhh), all good things
Never thought we sing the same song that all hoods sang
Thought it was all wood-grain, all good brain
We wouldn't bicker like the other fools, talk good game
Never imagine all the disaster that one good reign, could bring
Should blame, the game, and I could
It's kill or be killed, how could I refrain?
And forever be in debt, and that's never a good thing
So the pressure for success can put a good strain
On a friend you call best, and yes it could bring
Out the worst in every person, even the good and sane
Although we rehearsed it, it just ain't the same
When you put in the game at age sixteen
Then you mix things: like cars, jewelry, and miss thing
Jealousy, ego, and pride, and this brings
It all to a head like a coin, cha-ching
The root of evil strikes again, this could sting
Now the team got beef between the Post and the Point
This puts the ring in jeopardy – indefinitely

I feel like a black republican, money I got comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them (uhh, uhh)
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him (nah)
Probably end up back in the hood, I'm like, "Fuck it then"
I feel like a black militant takin' over the government
Can't turn my back on the hood, too much love for them (nah)
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him
Probably end up back in the hood, I'm like, "Fuck it then"

I'm back in the hood, they like, "Hey Nas" (uh)
Blowin' on purp, reflectin' on they lives (uh)
Couple of fat cats, couple of A.I.'s
Dreamin' of fly shit instead of them gray skies
Gray 5s, hatah's wishin' our reign dies
Pitch, sling pies, and niggas they sing, "Why"? (uhh)
Guess they ain't strong enough to handle their jail time
Weak minds keep tryin', follow the street signs
I'm standing on the roof of my building
I'm feelin' the whirlwind of beef, I inhale it
Just like an acrobat ready to hurl myself, through the hoops of fire
Sippin' 80 proof, bulletproof under my attire
Could it be the forces of darkness
Against hood angels of good, that form street politics?
Makes a sweet honest kid, turn illegal for commerce (uhh)
To get his feet out of them Converse – that's my word

I feel like a black republican, money keep comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them (uhh, uhh)
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him (nah)
Probably end up back in the hood, ah, "Fuck it then"
I feel like a black militant takin' over the government
Can't turn my back on the hood, too much love for them
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him
Probably end up back in the hood, I'm like, "Fuck it then"
Alchemist, you know me, man
I'm the type of nigga that write rhymes
Right on the spot in the studio soon as I hear the track
You know what I'm sayin'?
Word, but I wanted to bring
A couple of books to the studio today, man
I found these shits up in the crib, man, in boxes, man
I don't even remember when I was writin' these shits
Or what's in these shits, man
Probably a bunch of bullshit, man… fuck it, check it

How can I trust you when I can't trust me?
Picture myself a old man, a O.G.
Some niggas will conversate with liars all day
Time pass— (Nah, let me start somethin' else)
Soul on ice, death threats given by clowns
I guess livin' is prison when you live around clowns
I'm hexed, cursed, worse I been blessed first
I thought I was abnormal
‘Cause I would overcome any tasked called to
So there it is, I'm a prince, I'm against lames
Who do minor shit, swear they on the top of they game
Your rhymin' is called "Vagina Monologue," it kinda supports
Theories of scary niggas who should lie in the morgue
Rarely y'all come in contact with the real
Since Pun passed, he was the last shine of sun I could feel
Yo, said there's a few left since music's expressions of life
Damn, I wish I took more time to write in my book of rhymes

Oh shit, Tina!
I been lookin' for this bitch number, damn
No, this rhyme is weak
This is weak, I remember this bullshit right here
(My book of rhymes)
Gandhi was a… what the fuck?

Gandhi was a fool, nigga, fight to the death
The US Army is a school that teach you plights of conquest
(I wonder when I wrote this… nah, it's weak)
The money's your religion, sky the limit, live life
Numbers is big business, makes the poor live trife
The glimmers of hope provoke those without dollars to dream
Through your existence become wealthy, knowledge is king
Pimps and card sharks, thiefs, murderers with hard luck
Addicts and fiends prostitutes passin' for teens is my society
Cops that shoot blacks is routine for notoriety
Grow up watchin' well-dressed niggas with charms
Beautiful ladies on their arms
Dangerous new cars was my fantasy for Nas
Rubbin' my lips with Campophenique
Still behind the ears wet, turned out to be
Pioneers vets amongst hustlers, crack sellers, and liars and squares
(Nah, that was weak there)
My people be projects or jail, never Harvard or Yale
Pardon me type in my two-way while I'm chargin' my cell
It's hard to be iced up with Gucci, God, poverty's real
I can't fight you, ‘cause you would sue me, niggas be groupies
I see imitators tryin' to make albums, spittin' my style
And they don't even realize that I notice they stealin' Nas' shit
I pump some Rick James with that Teena Marie
My nina lean on me like Scoob and Scrap
This can't be my book of rhymes

This can't be my book of rhymes, writin' this bullshit!
(My book of rhymes)
Nah, neva that! Fuck that!
Aw, why you laughin', Alchemist?
Hah, you a funny nigga...
Naw, yeah (My book of rhymes)
I'm tellin' you, I'ma come up with some new shit now
Fuck that! I'ma write again now, fuck that!
I musta been high on some shit… what the fuck is this?!

Look how we treat pregnancy, women in the hood
Our values so low, our values are no good
Things our mothers told us we should've heeded
‘Cause now we need it, we older, almost able t—
I'm jealous of you, how come you so beautiful?
Smellin' fresh, youthful, intelligent, while I'm stressin' and shit
Ayo, I envy you ‘cause all you do is smile
And things come your way
Such a innocent child is what some say
I get upset ‘cause I just want to be treated the way you are
Like a star, not a worry in this world thus far
But wait a minute, we both need your mother's attention
I must be crazy, jealous of my own baby infant (Kinda crazy)
Listen up, gangstas and honies with your hair done
Pull up a chair, hon', and put it in the air, son
Dog, whatever they call you, God, just listen
I spit a story backwards, it starts at the endin'
The bullet goes back in the gun
The bullet holes close in the chest of this nigga
Now he back to square one, screamin', "shoot don't please"
I put my fifth back on my hip, it's like a VCR rewindin' a hit
He put his hands back on his bitch, my caravan doors open up
I jumped back in the van and closed it shut
Goin' reverse, slowly prepared
My nigga Jungle utters out somethin' crazy like, "go he there"
Sittin' in back of this chair, we hittin' the roach
The smoke goes back in the blunt
The blunt gets bigger in growth
Jungle unrolls it, put his weed back in the jar
The blunt turns back into a cigar
We listen to Stevie, it sounded like heavy metal fans
Spinnin' records backwards of AC/DC
I give my niggas dap, jump out the van, back first
Back upstairs, took off the black shirt
I'm in the crib with the phone to my ear
Listen up so y'all can figure out the poem real clear
The voice on the phone was like, "outside right we"
So with my mouth wide, holdin' my heat
Bullets I had plenty to squeeze, plenty for you
'Cause Jungle said, "block your on enemy's the"
Hung up the phone, then the phone rang
I'm laid in the bed, thinkin' about this pretty young thing
Who left, she came back, her clothes just fell to the rug
She fell to my bed and gave me a hug
I told her, "no hell," she talkin' about, "me kiss"
Bobbed her head then spit a nut back in my dick
Started suckin' with no hands, a whole lot of spit
Then got up and put her bra back on her tits
Got fully dressed and told me, "stressed really I'm"
Picked up her Gucci bag and left a nigga behind
Walkin' through the door, she rang the bell twice
I vomited vodka back in my glass with juice and ice
The clock went back from three to two to one
And that's about the time the story begun
That's when I first heard the voicemail on the cell
It said: "Son, we found that nigga we gotta kill."

*Message Beep*
Ayo son, ayo son, you hear me, you hear me?
Listen, man, this dude right on the block
Right now, man, I found him, right now
I see him right now, let's kill him!
*Message Beep*
"Yo, this Nas, leave it: peace."
(If Heaven was a mile away)
Would I pack up my bags and leave this world behind?
(If Heaven was a mile away)
Or save it all for you?
(If Heaven was a mile away)
Would I fill the tank up, put gas
And be out the front door in a flash?
Before reconsidering this hell with you
It ain't you, it's the thing you do (do)
It's tearing my heart in two
I would've fell with you, to Hell with you

If Heaven was a mile away, and you could ride by the gates
Would you try to run inside when it opens
Would you try to die today?
Would you pray louder, finally believe in His power
Even if you couldn't see Him, but you could feel Him
Would you still doubt Him?
How would you start actin'?
Would you try to put the keys down, thinkin' every drug sale that you make in the streets he can see now?
Would a fiend even want to get high? Would he stop smokin'
If he knew on his own two feet he could just stroll in?
To get away and escape from the craziness
And I bet you there's a Heaven for a atheist
It's hard takin' this, racist planet
Where they take a younger brother in a hand-cuff
Even if he innocent, "Nigga, get on the car!
Put your motherfuckin' hands up!"
Thinkin' I'ma lose it, my mom's in chemo
Three times a week yo, keep tryin', but people, it's hard
And God, your young soldier's not so bold but needs you
This world's my home, but world, I will leave you

(If Heaven was a mile away)
Would I pack up my bags and leave this world behind?
(If Heaven was a mile away)
Or save it all for you?
(If Heaven was a mile away)
Would I fill the tank up, put gas
And be out the front door in a flash?
Before reconsidering this hell with you
It ain't you, it's the thing you do (do)
It's tearing my heart in two
I would've fell with you, to Hell with you

Nigga, what you think, I'ma stop building?
I'ma stop feelin' like I'm Amistad's great-great-grandchildren?
How I'm not gonna want to make millions
Since the quarter water days, in the hallways
Makin' fake gold caps
With the Reeses Pieces wrapper in my mouth all day
But then my style has quite a while
That same type as Ill and Al Skratch
Game time took 'em cats, never looked back
Cristal, blowin' dub sacks
That's when it all just hit me: you see, the broads and Bentleys
Is nothin' unless my niggas spend it all with me
I'd give it all away quickly
Just to hear them all about some new kicks free
Of any autographs, and not to be recognized, forgive me
It's becomin' unbearable, makin' hits is easy
Put a famous bitch on a hook, there you go with a platinum CD
I know you heard the noise, preachers touchin' on alter boys
Sodomizin', not realizin' God is watchin', before the Lord
How could they do the Devil's work?
A man give another man head in Church
Hell, it hurts just to fathom the thought, wishin' that I fled the earth

(If Heaven was a mile away)
Would I pack up my bags and leave this world behind?
(If Heaven was a mile away)
Or save it all for you?
(If Heaven was a mile away)
Would I fill the tank up, put gas
And be out the front door in a flash?
Before reconsidering this hell with you
It ain't you, it's the thing you do (do)
It's tearing my heart in two
I would've fell with you, to Hell with you

You trapped in your own hell
Every day I wake up I'm blessed
Every day you wake up and breathe another breath, you blessed
To all them niggas runnin' around
Talkin' about, "I'm fucked up," "I got to get on," "I got to…"
"I'm in the grind," "I'm fucked up"
Yeah, we all in the grind
But look at the beautiful shit around you, it's a beautiful life
All my niggas locked up, keep ya heads up
Heaven's just a mile away
I'm talkin' Heaven on Earth, ain't got nothin' to do with money
Got nothin' to do with nothin' material
I'm talkin' about Heaven in your own heart
In your own world, baby, in your own existence
To my moms, look at me, baby
I love you, girl, your boy's shinin', God's son
Ayo, Queens get the money, niggas still screaming, paper chasing
Where presidential candidates is planning wars
With other nations, over steak with Masons
Pregnant teens give birth to intelligent gangsters
They daddies faceless
Play this by your stomach, let my words massage it and rub it
I'll be his daddy if there's nobody there to love it
Tell him his name's Nasir, tell him how he got here
Mama was just having fun with someone above her years
Niggas is still hating, talking that Nas done fell off with rhyming
He'd rather floss with diamonds
They pray "Please God, let him spit that Uzi in the army lining
That shorty doo-wop rolling oo-wops in the park reclining"
Take 27 emcees put 'em in a line and they're out of alignment
My assignment since he said retirement
Hiding behind 8 Mile and The Chronic
Gets rich but dies rhyming
This is high science
Now add 23 more from Queens to B-more
I'm over their heads like a bulimic on a seesaw
Now that's 50 porch monkeys ate up at the same time
Nasty Nasdaq, y'all gon' bow holmes, this Dow Jones
.80 cal chrome, needed time alone to zone
The mack left his iPhone and his 9 at home
My queen used her Milkshake to bring y'all to my slaughterhouses
I do this for the group home kids in boarding houses
This that nigga shit that's on the album
For the niggas inside the chalk line in 40 houses
Bring back Arsenio
Hip-hop was aborted so Nas breathes life, back into the embryo
Let us make man in our image, spit it, I'm Huey P in Louis V
At the eulogy throwing Molotovs for Emmett
You ain't as hot as I is
All of these false prophets is not messiahs
You don't know how high the sky is
The square mileage of Earth or what pi is
I'm the shaky hand that touched George Foreman in Zaire
The same hand that punched down devils that brought down the Towers
DJ Hot Day...

This kind of love is a once in a lifetime groove
Reach out and touch the love that I have for you, aww baby
I see you standing there
So lost and all alone
I wanna take you in my arms
And tell you that you’re home
I look into your eyes
I said I know you very well
I see a mirror of my life
A reflection of myself

3:45AM can't sleep, can't dream
I'm stuck, money problems pop up
How will I survive?
Guess it's best to decide not to decide
So that's my decision
Whatever happens happens
I keep making my millions
Can see myself in Presidential campaign dinners
But I'm passing blunts around a bunch of gang members
When you're too hood to be in them Hollywood circles
And you're too rich to be in that hood that birthed you
And you become better than legends you thought were the greatest
And outgrow women you loved and thought you could stay with
Life become clearer when you wipe down your mirror
And leave notes around for yourself to remember
I like to teach and build
With brothers about how easy it is to reach a mil
All you need is some skill, then it’s grind time
Imagination better than knowledge, says Einstein
It’s all in the mind
Nasty the nicest, I'm somewhat of a psychic
Just one minute after it's heard
You all'll recite it, you all'll repeat it
You'll call me a genius, if you didn't
Now that I said it I forced you to think it
Write in my little vignettes, sipping Moët
Bitch when you vision me, you vision the best
When I was young they called me Olu’s son
Now he's Nas' father, I was the good seed
He was the wise gardener

This kind of love is a once in a lifetime groove
Reach out and touch the love that I have for you, aww baby
I see you standing there
So lost and all alone
I wanna take you in my arms
And tell you that you’re home
I look into your eyes
I said I know you very well
I see a mirror of my life
A reflection of myself

Yeah, what y'all know about this..
Yo, beautiful life, often I dream that I can bring my niggas
Conservatives don’t understand slang linguistics
The burbs talking like the hood will change with quickness
Love the skinny model chicks but I prefer the thickness
So what I rap about my riches and I'm ostentatious
Get out a gangsta's business, seems to me your thoughts are basic
Try to compare what you live to the life I master
See the fly shit I wear, you try to rock it after
Big bracelets, golden Egyptian faces
White wine spritzers and Switzerland on vacation
The strip club scene favors Josephine Baker
Dope fiend neighbors, growing up I seen paper
I describe it, hope you can visualize it
This is reminiscent to all the parks in the project
When my British Knights can rival your Foamposites
Don’t make me pull my Lottos out the closet
Don't make me pull my Lottos out the closet
Ha ha ha

This kind of love is a once in a lifetime groove
Reach out and touch the love that I have for you, aww baby
I see you standing there
So lost and all alone
I wanna take you in my arms
And tell you that you’re home
I look into your eyes
I said I know you very well
I see a mirror of my life
A reflection of myself

You remind me, ohhhhhhhhhh
Yes it's true baby, ahh yeah
Y'all niggas better not be coming around me with that fugazi no more, you know? Got that thang for your ass, you know?
(I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna
I'm gonna have to leave you)

A vet stylin' at Met Gala, tuna salad from La Scala
Black sweats, swallow a lot of reefer
God, it hard to quit the bottom feeder, lobster eater
When I fast, I see Elijah's features
A million cash for a Nas feature
Nas cheaper, do it for free if you do it for me
52 bar verse if the beat is movin' me
Stumble through customs, coppin' Cubans at the Duty Free
Layin' on the most expensive beds, still I'm losin' sleep
Next to Jet's Beauty of the Week 1993
Chin-grabber, neck-choker, in-her-mouth-spitter
Blouse-ripper, ass-gripper, that dig-you-out nigga
I ain't gon' hold you, old head gave me old news
I don't owe you, shoulda heard when I told you
You are an extension of what I've worked hard to build
You believe in your own lies, can't be real
And the odds is that what you love can kill you
Like a heart physician who dies from a heart attack
I know the consumer behavior, I target that
You impressed with what they wearin', I started that

It's kinda terrific, the product of Slick Rick
Somebody woulda told me then I would come outta this shit rich
And start up a business, I woulda thought they was playin'
All them niggas I ran with, all that weight they was weighin'
A light bulb switched in my mind at the classes I cut
Just a spazz, puttin' wax in the blunt
The baddest I want, she wear Lipmatic to front
We building businesses, you can be mad if you want
It's bubbly 'til it's bubbles we see
Drinkin' like Dean Martin is nothin' to me
The spirits is somethin' I can't part and it's fun to be me
So cheers, here's to the Kanye production this eve
War of the Roses, it's war, baby
My nigga High said it's me, I drive 'em all crazy

(I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna)
The Wiz f/ Nipsey Russell - "What Would I Do If I Could Feel"
"But that's the whole tragic point my friends
What would I do if I could suddenly feel
And to know once again that what I feel is real?
I could cry, I could smile
I might lay back for awhile
Tell me what, what, what would I do if I could feel?"

I was young, I was survivin' the times
Waitin' for my moment, I was destined to shine
Little Ray had an NSX, I was hopin' I'm next
Wantin' bracelets, never had a rope on my neck
Unless I was holdin' Taiyeh chain – Rest In Peace
Even though that night you flipped on us, you warned us
If you came back and we still on the corners, we goners
Movin' on to move your arm in your watch
To another time on the block
‘Cause this 40 Side where they say shorty rhyme
Tragedy, he used to come through all the time
I'm talkin' Juice Crew, not what the word define
He had a sister named Erin, for sure was fine
That was my first crush, I bought my first mic
I wrote my first verse, I was about nine
I was about mine, fantasize house buyin'
Met Paul, he wore some big glasses
Him and Melquan took me where G Rap lived
I was happy just gettin' some answers
I ain't even know what a record advance was
I'm seein' hoes sex in the studio bathroom
With rap dudes, thinkin', "Wow, she moved me!"
Same girl then right now's a groupie
Back then she was like the star in a movie
Large jewelry and expensive Gucci
Next stop, Paid In Full posse recruits me
Knew they were some millionaires, their ropes were dookie
Eric B man lookin' like touch it, he shoot me
You see, every time Ra didn't show
I get to record demos at attempts to blow
I wonder, could they tell? How did they know?
Sixteen years later, here I go

"What-what, what-what, what would I do?" 4X

I'm with Akinyele in the street, tryin' to get us a deal
G Rap tried to get us to sign to Cold Chill
But Fly Ty didn't have the contract we wanted
Clark Kent just signed Das, he didn't want us
Russell said I sounded like G, the nigga fronted
Reef and Matty C offered me a little money
Shit a little funny, feel a little laughter
Rebel of Hip-Hop comin' through a white rapper
My boy MC Serch, nevertheless
Took me to Columbia, back then CBS
Chris Schwartz, RuffHouse, he was the best man
Now buggin' because the label had just dropped Def Jam
Could you picture Russell needin' a check, man?
But he smart, he plotted a plan for Polygram
Life is ill, again life's a movie
Then the roster's Cypress Hill, Nas and Fugees
Before I sold records, no promotion
The rap world like, "What's all this commotion?"
Went plat, mad bottles I'm toastin'
20/20 hindsight, but how did they know then?

"What-what, what-what, what would I do?" 4X

Invincible, lyrical, miracle man
Uh, but back to the matter at hand
‘Cause 10 years ago we all strived to be 25
Some cats didn't make it alive
Dated some stars but respect their privacy
Copped mad cars, layin' back in the driver's seat
Held myself down, just steerin' the wheel
Here I am, completed my whole record deal

"What-what, what-what, what would I do?" 4X

"What would I do
If I could reach inside of me
And to know how it feels
To say I like what I see?"
(Bonjour)
I should be more mature, sure, I'm spoiled
Hit up the south of France after tour, bonjour (bonjour)
How many girls pre-bate right before they date
So she can have restraint? She still get slayed (bonjour)
That's ill behavior, want the whip matted
Want her ass the fattest, beat it: Thriller jacket
A street metaphor: if your dog piss on the floor
Put his nose in it, check these niggas from the door

Oooh oooh La la, Oui-oui amour
Plenty of kisses, plein de bisous
Good day and best wishes
Comment allez-vous?
Bonjour

Eat at selective kitchens, speak on our next intentions
Over-creamy Polenta, it come chef recommended (bonjour)
Come through the side entrance; I arrive, bitches
Crackheads still owe me from '89 fixes (bonjour)
Havin' drinks in Vegas, my business
She didn't see me comin', now she's an eyewitness
Laissez le bon temps rouler
Say ahh so the kids could play

Oooh oooh La la, oui-oui amour
Plenty of kisses, plein de bisous
Good day and best wishes
Comment allez-vous?
Bonjour

Vacation, twisted, whatever happened, missed it
Vacations I didn't like, put myself through a guilt trip (bonjour)
All these beautiful places, but the cities be poor
You wealthy when your kid's upbringin' better than yours
All this money we gettin' could be gone in a minute
If we don't invest it—we long-term affected
Watch who you gettin' pregnant, that's long-term stressin'
I got a mil for every bump on your face, that's what I call a blessin'
Flexin'

My head looks straight up
And I'm wonderin', "What did I do?" (bonjour)
She looked at me like, "Damn, did I surprise you?"
Sure enough, as the sky's blue, she turned back around
And walked back down the avenue (bonjour)
She's waitin' for the right cue (bonjour)
I'm waitin' for the right clue (bonjour)

(oooh oooh La la, oui-oui amour)
She be leavin', still I smell of eau de parfum
She can't run 'cause I got Cinderella's right shoe
In that white gown that I be seein' right through
Crowd obscurin' my view
There's nothin' left to argue (bonjour)
At least there's not from my view (bonjour)
Oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang
Oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang
Oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang
Oo-chie wally wally
He really really really work my body
He really really really turned me out
He really really really got to gut me
He really really made me scream and shout
He really taught me how to work my body
He really taught me how to go down south
He really really tried to hurt me hurt me
I really love his thug and gangsta style

Yo we got chicks in the living room getting it on and
They ain't leaving till 6 in the morning
"O" is for oochie
Oh you ain't know how many O's in the bankroll
Sort of like the game show, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
But my name ain't Regis
Nas the one they call when they want their thing beat up
Honeys with bodies with Bravehearts, guns in the party
Waves, braids, and baldies, trademark's the army
Is that Horse? It must be, I heard he husky
Yeah, there go Jungle, eyes red looking for trouble
And that's Nas dancing with dimes but who his man is?
The imperial thug, it's cold D Grand Wiz
We taking honeys to the crib tonight
Guarantee we gon' get up in they rib tonight
Check the new slang, it's changed, the Braveheart gang, man
When you see me pass then holler oochie bang bang


Yeah what up ma? Take a look, you hypnotized
On how my long dick stretch your insides
For real ma, with your thick lips and thick thighs
Stroke both holes, pass it to Nas
Or pass it to Naish, or pass it to Jung
Or pass it to Horse, then that ass getting tossed
Fuck a Hustler book, Penthouse or Black Tail
I got bitches sending my niggas flicks in jail
I fuck a bitch face more than her waist for real
And ain't no pussy like new pussy that's how a nigga feel
Bust three times, throw her the peace sign, she sleep
Then my dick sleep and I ain't gotta call her for weeks
Long leg hoes, mo'head hoes, married bitches
Me and my dog fucking them both they got us switching
Is the nigga gangsta? Yeah, that's how I'm living
That's how I'm playing - I got these freak fucking hoes singing


Little young thing go around my dick with your tongue ring
Deep throat my nine inch, gut from the front and
Grind from the side and fuck from behind and
Grab her hair slap her ass, she screaming like she dying
Make her cum four times without even trying
I'll beat that pussy up there's no denying
Hit her where she doodie at, make the booty fat
Little cutie rat walking by with the doobie wrap
Tight blue jeans, Air Max, small Gucci bag
No loot and no job, stay home giving blow jobs
Like no prob, it's simple
Holla out the window it's the project nympho
Fuck my whole crew, you know how we do
You got that good pussy I can share with my people
Be a brave girl, do your thang
Let them titties hang, I'll have all the bitches saying


When it comes to sex I'm similar to the Thriller in Manilla
Bitches call me Horse the pussy filler
I'll fuck a big boned or slim chick
Beat that pussy up real quick then send home the bitch
Ain't no sleeping in my bedroom when Henny's in my dick
When Flex drop the bomb I bust a nut on this bitch
Deep throat, ceaser gold or pun wicked hoes
Who like the way I thug and the way I flow
I like head in the Benz, the four door or the Coupe
Head in the staircase, the cellar or the roof
Head in the studio, the bathroom or the booth
Head from a project chick or one with crazy loot
Like Nia Long in a cherry thong with the lights on
Sipping Perignon with Kelly Price on
I pull out my python, I hit it while my wife's gone
Long dick the bitch all night, I'll make her pussy sing the song

Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down

Yeah, I guess I'm a disappointment, doin' everything I can
I don't wanna make you disappointed, it's annoying
I just wanna make you feel like everything I ever do
Was never tryna make an issue for you, but I guess the more you
Thought about everything you were never even wrong
In the first place, right? Yeah, I'ma just ignore you
Walking towards you with my head down
Lookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you
Paranoia, what did I do wrong this time?
That's parents for you
Very loyal? Shoulda had my back
But you put a knife in it—my hands are full
What else should I carry for you?
I cared for you, but…

Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down

Yeah, you don't wanna make this work
You just wanna make this worse
Want me to listen to you, but you don't ever hear my words
You don't wanna know my hurt yet
Let me guess, you want an apology, probably
How can we keep going at a rate like this?
We can't, so I guess I'ma have to leave
Please, don't come after me
I just wanna be alone right now, I don't really wanna think at all
Go ahead, just drink it off
Both know you're gonna call tomorrow like nothing's wrong
Ain't that what you always do?
I feel like every time I talk to you, you're in an awful mood
What else can I offer you?
There's nothing left right now, I gave it all to you

Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down

Yeah, don't talk down to me
That's not gonna work now
Packed all my clothes and I moved out
I don't even wanna go to your house
Every time I sit on that couch
I feel like you lecture me, eventually, I bet that we
Could have made this work
And prolly woulda figured things out
But I guess I'm a letdown
But it's cool, I checked out
Oh, you wanna be friends now?
Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now
Sit around and talk about the good times that didn't even happen
I mean, why are you laughing?
Must have missed that joke, let me see if I can find a reaction
No, but at least you're happy

Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Oh, I let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
And I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Oh, let you down

I'm sorry
I'm so sorry now
I'm sorry that I let you down
How could you leave so unexpected?
We waited, we waited
For you, but you just left us
We needed you, I needed you

Yo, I don't know what it's like to be addicted to pills
But I do know what it's like to be a witness, it kills
Mama told me she loved me, I'm thinkin' this isn't real
I think of you when I get a whiff of that cigarette smell, yeah
Welcome to the bottom of hell
They say pain is a prison, let me out of my cell
You say you proud of me, but you don't know me that well
Sit in my room, tears running down my face and I yell
Into my pillowcases, you say you coming to get us
Then call 'em a minute later just to tell us you not, I'm humiliated
I'm in a room with a parent that I don't barely know
Some lady in the corner watching us while she's taking notes
I don't get it mom, don't you want to watch your babies grow?
I guess pills are more important, all you have to say is "no"
But you won't do it, will you? You gon' keep popping, 'til those pills kill you
I know you're gone, but I can still feel you

Why would you leave us? Why would you leave us here?
How could you leave us here?
How could you leave us? Why would you leave us? Oh
Hey

I got this picture in my room and it kills me
But I don't need a picture of my mom, I need the real thing
Now a relationship is something we won't ever have, but why do I feel like I lost something that I never had?
You should have been there when I graduated
Told me you loved me and congratulations, instead you left us at the window waitin'
Where you at mom?
We're too young to understand, where you at, huh?
Yeah, I know them drugs have got you held captive
I can see it in your eyes, they got your mind captured
Some say it's fun to get the high, but I am not laughin'
And what you don't realize and what you not graspin'
That I was nothing but a kid, who couldn't understand it
I ain't gon' say that I forgive you 'cause it hasn't happened
I thought that maybe I'd feel better as time passes
If you really cared for me, then where you at then?

Why would you leave us? Why would you leave us here?
How could you leave us here?
How could you leave us? Why would you leave us? Oh
Hey

Our last conversation, you and I sat in the living room
Talkin' 'bout my music and I brought you some to listen to
You started cryin', telling me "this isn't you"
A couple weeks later, guess you were singin' a different tune
You took them pills for the last time, didn't you?
They took you from us once, I guess they came back to finish you
Cryin' my eyes out in the studio is difficult
Music is the only place that I can go to speak to you
It took everything inside of me, not to scream at your funeral
Sittin' in my chair, that person talkin' was pitiful
I wish you were here, mama, but every time I picture you
All I feel is pain, I hate the way I remember you
They found you on the floor, I could tell you felt hollow
Gave everything you had, plus your life to them pill bottles
You gave everything you had, plus your life to them pill bottles
Don't know if you hear me or not, but if you're still watching, why?

Why would you leave us? Why would you leave us here?
How could you leave us here?
How could you leave us? Why would you leave us? Oh
Hey

Sometimes I think about like
Sometimes I think about things like, you know
When I'd have kids, I'm like
You won't be there, you know?
You won't be there for any of that
And I'll never get to see you again
Sometimes I wish I would've just called you
I wish I would have just picked up the phone
Wish you were here
I mean you should of been there for us
You should have been here!
Them pills got you, right?
Them pills got you, right?
I wish you were here…
Insidious is blind inception
What's reality with all these questions?
Feels like I missed my alarm and slept in
Slept in
Broken legs, but I chase perfection
These walls are my blank expression
My mind is a home I'm trapped in
And it's lonely inside this mansion

Yo, my mind is a house with walls, covered in lyrics
They're all over the place, there's songs in the mirrors
Written all over the floors, all over the chairs
And you get the uncut version of life when I go downstairs
That's where I write when I'm in a bad place and need to release
And let out the version of NF you don't wanna see
I put holes in the walls with both of my fists 'til they bleed
You might get a glimpse of how I cope with all this anger in me
Physically abused, now that's the room that I don't wanna be in
That picture ain't blurry at all, I just don't wanna see it
And these walls ain't blank, I just think I don't wanna see 'em
But why not? I'm in here, so I might as well read 'em
I gotta thank you for this anger that I carry around
Wish I could take a match and burn this whole room to the ground
Matter of fact, I think I'ma burn this room right now
Somehow, this memory, for some reason, just won't come down
You used to put me in the corner, so you could see the fear in my eyes
Then took me downstairs and beat me 'til I screamed and I cried
Congratulations, you'll always have a room in my mind
But I'ma keep the door shut and lock the lyrics inside

Insidious is blind inception
What's reality with all these questions?
Feels like I missed my alarm and slept in
And slept in
Broken legs, but I chase perfection
These walls are my blank expression
My mind is a home I'm trapped in
And it's lonely inside this mansion, inside this mansion

Yo, my mind is a house with walls, covered in pain
See, my problem is, I don't fix things, I just try to repaint
Cover 'em up, like it never happened, say, "I wish I could change"
Are you confused? Come upstairs and I'll show you what I mean
This room's full of regrets, it just keeps getting fuller, it seems
The moment I walk into it's the same moment that I wanna leave
I get sick to my stomach every time I look at these things
But it's hard to look past when this is the room where I sleep
I look around, one of the worst things I wrote on these walls
Was the moment I realized that I was losing my mom
One of the first things I wrote was, "I wish I woulda called"
But I should just stop now, we ain't got enough room in this song
And I regret the fact that I struggled trying to find who I am
And I lie to myself and say I do the best that I can
Shrug it off like it ain't nothing, like it's out of my hands
Then get ticked off whenever I see it affecting my plans
And I regret watchin' these trust issues eat me alive
And at the rate I'm goin', they'll probably still be there when I die
Congratulations, you'll always have a room in my mind
The question is, will I ever clean the walls off in time?

Insidious is blind inception
What's reality with all these questions?
Feels like I missed my alarm and slept in
And slept in
Broken legs, but I chase perfection
These walls are my blank expression
My mind is a home I'm trapped in
And it's lonely inside this mansion, inside this mansion

So this part of my house, no one's been in it for years
I built a safe room and I don't let no one in there
'Cause if I do, there's a chance that they might disappear
And not come back, and I admit, I am emotionally scared
To let anyone inside, so I just leave my doors locked
You might get other doors to open up, but this door's not
'Cause I don't want you to have the opportunity to hurt me
And I'll be the only person that I can blame when you desert me
I'm barricaded inside, so stop watchin'
I'm not coming to the door, so stop knockin', stop knockin'
I'm trapped here, God keeps saying I'm not locked in
I chose this, I am lost in my own conscience
I know that shuttin' the world out ain't solvin' the problem
But I didn't build this house because I thought it would solve 'em
I built it because I thought that it was safer in there
But it's not, I'm not the only thing that's livin' in here
Fear came to my house years ago, I let him in
Maybe that's the problem, 'cause I've been dealing with this ever since
I thought that he would leave, but it's obvious, he never did
He must have picked the room and got comfortable and settled in
Now I'm in a position, it's either sit here, and let 'em win
Or put him back outside where he came from, but I never can
'Cause in order to do that, I'd have to open the doors
Is that me or the fear talking? I don't know anymore

It's lonely
Inside (inside), inside (inside)
It's lonely (it's lonely)
Oh, yeah, it's loney
Inside this mansion
I'm lookin' like I'm gonna get it, you prolly don't get it
I come in your house with a microphone
Lookin' like I'm 'bout to set up a show in your kitchen
I'm out of my mind, but I feel like I'm in it
If I never make it, don't make any difference
I'm still gonna kill it, you know what the deal is
Ain't never no chillin' when I'm in the buildin'
NF is a monster, I am a villain
My music is sick, and you don't know what "ill" is
You better get back, I don't write any filler
I write what I feel and I'm feelin' a million
So you better shh, be quiet, you hear it?
I'm 'bout to lose it
I'm on a whole different level of music
Don't treat me like I have no clue how to do this
You better rethink what you're thinkin' and move it
Now picture me writin' when I was a kid tryna make it in music, I think it is crazy
I spent all my money on studio time, tryna get on my music so people could play it
I'ma keep it one hundred, my music was terrible, learned to get better, the more that I made it
Go back to my Moments album, most of you people, you prolly don't know what I'm sayin', hold up!
What you're witnessin' now? Don't try to figure me out
I grab on that microphone, jawin' the crowd
They was laughin' at me, who they laughin' at now, huh?
I laugh at myself, some people they lookin' like, "wow"
The moment you told me that you was a rapper
I couldn't believe it, you believe it now?
Step in the booth and I murder it
You never heard of a rapper that kill it like I do
I sleep on the couch in the studio
Stay up 'til three in the morning, and write 'til I get more
The moment I wake up I feel like I don't even sleep
And I'm ready to put out my record
Which, thank you for buyin', maybe you burned it
But either way, I'm gonna wreck it
I look at the industry, look what it did to me
You'll never make it if you never grind
You put a whole lot of money into it
You better be ready to give it your time
I look at the past awful years of my life
And I promise you I have been given it mine
Try to keep up with this, I'm not a puppet
No string on my back, I'm one of a kind
Music is changing, no way to tame this
I am an artist, look what I painted
Hang up the caution tape, I'm dangerous
Does anyone know where my brain is?
Rappers are comfortable knowin' they're famous
But I, really don't care what your name is
And I, really don't care if I'm nameless
Y'all just drivin' around, I know where my lane is
Cocky? Nah, I'm competitive?
This is a job for me, it's adrenaline
Don't try to box me in, I am Mayweather
I come in the ring, my punches are way better
I never drink, but I live in these bars
The moment you blink is the moment you lost
Say you a king, who put you in charge?
Don't care what you think, I'll break in your car
Climb on the top of it, sound the alarm
And wake up the neighborhood, rap in your yard
And carry the speakers on both of my arms
'Til you keep sleepin' on me, I'm at large
Enough with the jokes, I ain't jokin'
You come in a session with me, I'ma show you what dope is
And when I say "dope," I ain't talkin' 'bout smokin'
I'm talkin' 'bout music that has an emotion
I look at this mic, it's part of my family
Take it away, I'm comin' to find you
I've been through a lot in my life
And it's hard to get people to listen when no one's behind you
And then Capitol came in the picture and gave me a shot
And look at it now
I look at the team I'm dealin' with, agh
These people ain't playin' around
Lookin' back, I gotta laugh
I was in a whole different place a year ago
I look at the math, I look at the map
And thank you God, I swear it's a miracle
And I'm sorry, but I gotta leave
But, man, this track was beautiful
The least I can do if I murder a beat
Is take the time to go to its funeral, haha
Yeah, they say when we grow up
You'll understand when you're older
Guess I'm still a kid, I don't know it
If I'll ever let go of this (yeah)
Say goodbye to the old me
We ain't friends anymore, you don't know me (real music)
I know I could die any moment
If I do just remember this

Yeah, handouts create lazy people I'm not impressed with
You want something in life, then why don't you go and get it?
Actions speak louder than words do, it's pretty quiet, isn't it?
Look at the world we live in, defined by comment sections
Surround yourself with people that challenge how you think
Not people that nod their head and act like they agree
Those people will cut you open just to watch you bleed
Always be yourself, not the person that you pretend to be, no!
These people gon' tell you that you will never make it
Then when you do, they gon' say they knew you were goin' places
That's just how it works, next thing you know you'll be overrated
Hearing people say they miss the "old you," it's crazy, ain't it?
And perfect people don't exist, so don't pretend to be one
I don't need pats on the back from people for my achievements
When I die I wanna know that I lived for a reason
Anyone can take your life, but not what you believe in; no

Yeah, they say when we grow up
You'll understand when you're older
Guess I'm still a kid, I don't know it
If I'll ever let go of this
Say goodbye to the old me
We ain't friends anymore, you don't know me
I know I could die any moment
If I do just remember this

Yeah, don't take opinions from people that won't listen to yours
If money's where you find happiness, you'll always be poor
If you don't like the job you have, then what do you do it for?
The cure to pain isn't something you buy at liquor stores, nah
The real you is not defined by the size of your office
The real you is who you are when ain't nobody watchin'
You spend your whole life worried about what's in your wallet
For what? That money won't show up in your coffin, woo!
Yeah, anger's a liar, he ain't got no respect
I fell in love with my pain and I slept with my regrets
Happiness saw it happen, maybe that's why she up and left
Joy called me a cheater, said she ain't coming back
I've always had a problem with relationships
But that's what happens when you see the world through a broken lens
Mistakes can make you grow, that doesn't mean you're friends
Who you are is up to you, don't leave it up to them, no

Yeah, they say when we grow up
You'll understand when you're older
Guess I'm still a kid, I don't know it
If I'll ever let go of this
Say goodbye to the old me
We ain't friends anymore, you don't know me
I know I could die any moment
If I do just remember this

Yeah, they say you got into music, you signed up to be hated
That's kinda weird cause I don't remember signing my name up
Coming from people that give advice but never take none
I like my privacy, but, lately, I feel it's invaded
I heard that life's too short, don't let it pass you by
We waste a lot of time crying over wasted time
It's not about what people think, it's how you feel inside
My biggest failures in life are knowing I never tried, woo!
I look at the world from a different angle
People change; even Satan used to be an angel
Think twice before you're bitin' on the hand that made you
Don't believe what you believe just 'cause that's how they raised you
Think your own thoughts, don't let them do it for you
Say you want a drink, don't wait for people to pour it on you
Cut out the lies, stay close to the people you know are loyal
Grab your own glass and fill it, don't let your fear destroy you, woo!
I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night?
You say all I ever do is just control your life
But how you gonna lie like that, how you gonna lie like that?

Yeah, I heard you said I ain't the type for you
I don't regret it though, I learned from it
They should have you locked up for all the time you stole from us, (woo)
Took you out when I had no money
Only person that you ever cared about was you, that's why it's so funny
You want somebody that'll keep you warm at night, then, tell me, why you actin' cold to me?
You ain't the only one to blame, no I'm the one that made you rich when I bought every lie you sold to me
Yeah, heard you threw away the pictures
But you still got the memories of us, so I guess I don't really make a difference
Flippin' through 'em in your head
Got you texting me all hours of the night
Yeah, you told me that you needed distance
What's the deal with you?
You say you want a man that keeps it real
Then why you mad when I get real with you?
You want someone to pay the bills for you
Went from failin' you, now I feel for you, liar

I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night?
You say all I ever do is just control your life
But how you gonna lie like that, how you gonna lie like that?

Look, let me guess, you want to stay friends?
Tellin' people that's how we been?
Tellin' everybody, yeah, that we was barely speakin'
Ah, that's kinda funny, why'd you call me every day then?
It's immaturity, you goin' off the deep end
You just want somebody you can chill and get some drinks with, cool
Then don't hit me on the weekend, tellin' me you missed the way we talked and how I listen, yeah
Why you playin' with my mind, huh?
Why you playin' with my time, huh?
Told me, "We should let it go and put it all behind us"
That's what I did, now you askin' me what I done, I was
Waitin' for this day, I saw it comin'
I think you just like attention, tryna tell me all your problems
I got issues of my own, I ain't got time for all this drama
You told me that you don't really wanna talk—then why you callin', huh?

I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night?
You say all I ever do is just control your life
But how you gonna lie like that, how you gonna lie like that?

How you gonna lie, how you gonna lie like that?
Baby, how you gonna lie, how you gonna lie like that?
How you gonna lie, baby, how you gonna lie like that?
No, no, how you gonna lie like that?

I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night?
You say all I ever do is just control your life
But how you gonna lie like that, how you gonna lie like that?

Tell me how you 'bout to lie like that
Tell me how you 'bout to lie like-
Yeah, yeah
I just need some time, I'm tryna think straight
I just need a moment in my own space
Ask me how I'm doin', I'll say "okay," yeah
But ain't that what we all say?
Sometimes I think back to the old days
In the pointless conversations with the old me
Yeah, back when my momma used to hold me
I wish somebody woulda told me

If you want love, you gon' have to go through the pain
If you want love, you gon' have to learn how to change
If you want trust, you gon' have to give some away
If you want love, if you want love

Look, as a kid I used to think life
Is moving so slow, I watch it go by
Look out the window on my bus ride
I thought the world was so small, through my closed eyes
I've always tried to control things
In the end that's what controls me
Maybe that's why I'm controllin'
I wish somebody woulda told me

If you want love, you gon' have to go through the pain
If you want love, you gon' have to learn how to change
If you want trust, you gon' have to give some away
If you want love, if you want love

The older I get, I feel like I'm always tryna save time
Talkin' to the voices in my head, they make me think twice
Tellin' me it doesn't mean it's wrong because it feels right
I'm scared that one day I'll wake up and wonder where'd the time go
Talk about the past like it's the present while I rock slow
I'll sit in the living room and laugh with kids of my own
And tell 'em

If you want love, you gon' have to go through the pain
I wish you woulda told me
If you want love, you gon' have to learn how to change
I wish somebody woulda told me
If you want trust, you gon' have to give some away
You gon' have to give
If you want love, if you want love
If you want love, if you want love
Yeah, I gotta say, like a month ago
I was talking to fans
And one of 'em pulled me aside and said
"We never met, but I swear that you know who I am
I've been through a lot
I don't know how to express it to people, don't think that I can
But I got that Mansion CD on rotation
That's real for me, Nate, you do not understand"
It's crazy for me
Kids hit me up, say they slittin' they wrists on the daily
This music is more than you think
Don't book me for just entertainment, it's entertainin'
Hearin' these parents, they telling their kids
My music is violent—you gotta be kidding me
I guess that your definition of violence and mine
Is something that we look at differently
How do you picture me, huh?
Want me to smile, you want me to laugh?
You want me to walk on the stage with a smile on my face
When I'm mad and put on a mask? For real though
I mean, what you expect from me?
I'm tryna do this respectfully
They say that life is a race
I knew my problems would prolly catch up eventually
I do my best to be calm
How you gon' write me and tell me you'd slaughter my family?
That's just a glimpse to the stuff that gets sent to me
These are the parts of my life they don't never see, woo!
I am aware, it's aggressive
I am not here for acceptance
I don't know what you expected
But what you expect when you walk in a therapy session, huh?

Therapy, therapy session
Therapy, therapy session

This girl at the show looked me in the face
And told me her life's full of drama (Yeah!)
Said her dad is abusive
Apparently, he likes to beat on her mama
I got so angry inside
I wanted to tell her to give me his number
But what you gon' do with it, right?
You gon' hit him up then he'll start hittin' her harder, that's real
These kids, they come to my shows
With tears in they eyes
Imagine someone looking at you
And sayin' your music's the reason that they are alive
Sometimes I don't know how to handle it
This type of life isn't glamorous
This ain't an act for the cameras (nah!)
You see me walk on these stages
But have no idea what I'm dealing with after it, nah!
I put it all in the open
This is the way that I cope with all my emotion
I'm taking pictures with thousands of people
But honestly, I feel like nobody knows me
I'm tryin' to deal with depression
I'm tryin' to deal with the pressure
How you gon' tell me my music does not have a message?
When I'm looking out at this crowd full of people I know I affected, agh!
I got some things in my life
I know I should let 'em go
Let me jot it down
Let me take a mental note
I put it all in this microphone
Think about that for a minute
What is the point of this song? I'm just venting
But what you expect from a therapy session, huh?

Therapy, therapy session
Therapy, therapy session

What you think about me
—That doesn't worry me
I know I handle some things immaturely
I know that I need to grow in maturity
I ain't gon' walk on these stages, in front of these people
And act like I live my life perfectly
That doesn't work for me
"Christian" is not the definition of what "perfect" means
I ain't the type to be quiet
I ain't gon' sit here in silence
If I wouldn't say what I say to your face
Then I promise you, I wouldn't say it in private
I am not lyin'
People go off on my page, and I'm tryin' to quit the replyin'
But this is ridiculous
I'm passionate, man, I really mean what I'm writing
You want me to keep it a hundred?
Okay, I'll keep it a hundred
I see a whole lot of talkin' on socials
But honestly, I don't see nothing in public
I kinda love it, yeah
"Why don't you write us some happy raps?
That would be awesome"
"All of your music is moody and dark, Nate"
—Don't get me started (Yeah!)
You wanna know what it's like if you met me in person?
Listen to my verses
This music is not just for people
Who sit in the pews and pray at the churches, nah!
I won't reject it
I don't expect everyone to respect it
I don't expect you to get my perspective
But what you expect from a therapy session?
Huh?

I mean, I think sometimes people—they confuse what I'm doin'
I write about life, I write about things that I'm actually dealing with
Something, that I'm actually experiencing
This is real for me
Like, this is something that personally helps me as well
I'm not confused about who gave me the gift
God gave me the gift and he gave me the ability to—to do this
And he also gave me this as an outlet
And that's what music is for me
When I feel something, whether it's anger
Um, it's a passion about something—or frustration
Like, this is where I go
This is—this is—that's the whole "NF Real Music" thing, man
This is real for me—I need this
This is a therapy for me
Yeah, real music
Agh! Yo
Just get in that, you get in that head space, y'know? Woo!

Will somebody get the body bags? We gon' put the beats in 'em, nah
Put the MCs in 'em, season 'em, put 'em on a beat with me, then I'm eatin' 'em
Get away from the table, you rappers ain't hungry enough, you rappers ain't hungry like us
They talk about me like I'm here, they talk about you like you was, woo!
That nurse came into my room, she told me I'm sick in the head
I'm in hip-hop's hospital bed, with a pad and a pen and a brace on my neck
They told me that I'm never leavin'—why? I am as ill as it gets
Any rapper that say that they runnin' the game, I'ma come in they session and cut off they legs, woo!
Strap a grenade to my head, pull out the pin, my music is mind-blowin'
Ain't nobody do it like I do it
You ain't ever been on my level, I got a problem with the way they keep on talkin', and actin' like everybody gonna get it, better sleep with your eyes open
You wanna know what I noticed?
Look around at my fan base and they ready (I see you!)
That last album was heavy (I see you!)
That last album was gritty
How you gon' match that? Just let me–
Do what I do best, you're better off playin' Russian roulette
Than comin' in a booth with me 'cause I get a little bit intense—I'm like, "Who's next?"
Y'all better watch it, take a look at where the clock is
It's my time, this ladder of music that I climbed
I took the machete, the game isn't ready, them rappers, they comin' up on me, I cut off the ladder, and I told 'em, "Bye-bye" (Bye-bye)
What, you lookin' for a high-five? Nice try! (Woo!)
Do not believe everything that you read on the Internet
I do not know who your dentist is, but he should clean out your mouth, don't call me a sellout, that's something I've never been
I've been through Hell all my life though, but I know what Heaven is
Father, forgive me, for I am a sinner, but You gave me music as medicine, woo!
And nobody want a problem when they get in my zone, better leave me be!
I'm a mean MC, better feed me rappers or feed me beats, agh!
Feed me both of 'em, they like, "Nate, what's it like to be famous?"
Hahahahahaha, umm, I'll let you know if I make it! (Yeah)
I wonder what life would be like if I didn't stick out my neck
Two hundred dollars inside of my bank account, woo! I was livin' on that
I need some money to pay for my rent, I need some money to pay for my gas
I'm not complainin', I'm just bein' honest, I promise that I will not beg for respect, nah!
I get so frustrated, take a look at what I've created
Time is wasting, and I ain't waiting
I'm a doctor with no job, me, I don't have no patience, I keep pacing–
Back and forth, I keep racing
You ain't never been in my book and I got a problem with it, why? 'Cause you actin' like you read my pages
I wreck these stages, real talk, better give me space 'cause I am chasing
Something they told me that I won't make it, agh!
I'm not famous, I'm just Nathan (Woo!)
And I wonder how the world gon' take this
They might hate it, but you know anything about me, you know that don't mean I'm changin'
'Cause you know I'm real with it, don't care if you feelin' it, I'm feelin' it
You don't like it? Then deal with it
And if God ain't real—real isn't
Used to wonder why I existed, I exist in the world that's real different
And, "What you gon' be when you grow up, Nate?" I doubt they will get it
My life is a mess, better watch your step when you step in it, some of this brain is off-limits
I'm off in a world you don't get, 'cause you ain't ever been in it
In ten minutes I still couldn't explain what's inside my brain, don't mess with it
I've invested a lot of me inside these lines, I'm just protectin' 'em
Everybody wanna hear the real version of life, then don't get so sensitive
When I say something a little bit raw, I jot my thoughts and they call it "negative"
You wanna know where my heart is? I stand out 'cause I wear my garbage
I work my hardest and every time I look into the mirror I don't forget about where I started, woo!

Tell me, what am I doing here?
Tell me, what am I doing here?
Tell me, what am I, what am I doing? Mmm
Tell me, what am I doing here?
I said, what am I doing here?
Tell me, what am I doing here, if
I'm not being real, mmm
What, are you scared of me? That's embarassin'
If it wasn't for me, you would've never wrote Therapy
I've been here for you, but how come you're never there for me?
It's a little bit twisted, but I miss when you and I had scary dreams
I don't really wanna talk about it!
Well, that's too bad now, Nate, shut up!
Now, where were we?
Well, back in the day when
You and I had it all mapped out in the basement
Cryin' in your room like a baby
"I wish mom was here!"
We all do so we wouldn't have to hear about it every single record
You don't really wanna change me
Yeah, I'm the one that made this happen
Do you really wanna get rid of your main attraction?
Let's pack our bags and go back to Gladwin now
Yeah, it's time for the third record
And you know I got the content
I don't wanna make you nervous
But it ain't like it used to be, we got a lotta people watchin'
You told me that you don't want me in your life, that's pretty hard to digest
And I told you I'd leave when we die, and we ain't died yet
Therapy Session was beautiful, Nate, but I'm wonderin' what's comin' next
Yeah, get that stupid hat off of your head when I'm talkin' to you, you hear what I said?
You don't like the prison I built you?
Yeah, you wanna know what the funny thing is?
You keep on talkin' to me like a stranger, but we've been together since you were a kid, yeah
Took us from a no-name, told you everything was okay
Now you tryna cut me out of it like I ain't never been a part of it, I am the heart of it, I made this whole thing
Yeah, I put us on the dope stage, you must have no brain
What's the point of having guns if you can't aim?
What's the point of havin' blood with no veins?
What's the point of havin' love with no pain?
What I'm sayin' is me without you doesn't make any sense
I know I'm intense in controlling, but you need to learn how to cope with it, that's just the way that it is
If you didn't want me to live in your house, you shouldn't have let me move in
It's comfortable here and I like it, I got my own room and everything, it don't get better than this
You say you wanna own your life, then wake up and take your own advice
You just mad 'cause you know I'm right
Yeah, I'm flattered you put me in Mansion, but you should've told 'em right
'Bout your hands on the coldest nights
You didn't tell 'em 'bout the times you and I used to hold the mic
I mean, what are you, outta your mind?
'Cause both of us will be, come on, let's go outside!
Is this what you wanted?
Both of us out in the open? Let's do it then!
I mean, why are you doin' this?
I know that you're mad, but I'm not in the mood for this
We got a record to drop
So why you actin' like I'm not a part of it?
And where is my shovel at?
Prolly out back—where it always is
You can't get rid of all of me!
I'm the reason why—
Nah, shut up, I don't wanna hear another sentence
Hey, I'm NF
"Is it me or the fear talkin'?" Ha! What a dumb question!
Yeah, it's real music 'til the day we die, right?
Yeah, ain't that the slogan, Nathan?
Thought I told you to keep your mouth shut
I mean, so what? You know I never listen
Let me guess, we gon' dig a hole, kill the track, and prolly put a beat in it
Rap about it for like three minutes
Ayy, that's pretty deep, isn't it?
Wait a minute, you don't really think for a second that you're puttin' me in this?
No, of course not, just a little deeper then we'll go inside and we can stop diggin' (woo)
You had me scared for a second, I thought we were diggin' my grave (*thunk*)
We did, what, you don't like bein' afraid?
Here's a dose of your own medicine, what, you don't like how it tastes?
My therapist told me don't bury my issues, but I'ma be honest, man, I'm feelin' great!
I think it's only right we go back to where you were created
I wrote a song for Johnny without you, but he ain't gon' like it, let's see how he takes it (takes it)
He probably don't even remember us, does he?
I wish I was buryin' anger
But both of us know I'ma need him for that song, he still lives in the basement
Almost done, shoulda done this a year ago, I don't know why I waited
You know how I get, I put everything off in my personal life, you hear what I'm sayin'?
That was a joke, yeah, it's hilarious, ain't it?
You'll spend the rest of your life in my backyard or back of my mind, depends how you see it
Put the shovel away, time to go back in the house now, you'll be out in a week
Tellin' me you want your room back, that's funny; what, you ain't got nowhere to sleep?
I'ma just look out the window and laugh at you, this is crazy to me
'Cause I thought you had me in prison this whole time, but I'm the one holdin' the keys
Look, people ask me what the future is
All I know is I'll be doin' this
All I know is things are moving quick
That's convenient for me 'cause that's how I live
Now they see me out here movin' up
You don't like me, that makes two of us
Time change, yeah, I can't adjust
Yo, it’s who you are not who you was, oh my
Yeah, just went to Europe, they said the single is working
I think I'm learning
I am way more than what people might think when they look on the surface
What is my purpose? Yeah
That is a question that I have been asking myself and it hurts
'Cause it's prolly something I should already know but I don’t know it yet, I'm tryna grow as a person, woo!
I'm sick of people tellin' people I'm here 'cause of marketing dollars, oh
You think that everything is gonna blow just 'cause you market it harder? No
I got my hands in everything, now they out here tryna get to me, stop tryna lecture me
You don't compare to my level of thinking, so why do you think you compare to my energy, huh?
Small circle, but the number's growin'
Fame called me, I'm like, "How you doin'?"
Hung up on him, I ain't ready for it
I'll get back to that when I make album four
Less talkin', I've been workin' more
Better me is what I'm workin' towards
Y'all judgin', but we not in court, no, we not in court, oh Lord!
Last couple years, let's recap
I make a livin' off of writin' out my regrets
I'm doin' me, I don't care where the scene's at
Try to give me feedback, I don't really need that
I used to walk on stage in a V-neck
I used to wear a lil' tie with a black vest
I came a long way, why you lookin' upset?
I'm tryna paint a picture, get the vision, you ain't hear it yet, woo!
Look, hold up, hold up, wait a minute, please
Flow's switchin', I got ADD
Brain scatters when you play the beat
It don't matter what you say to me
I'll be doin' this at 83
I've been doin' this since ABCs
In the major leagues doin' major things, don't play with me, woo!
I'm livin' life in the fast lane
Wake up every morning thinkin' I'ma have a bad day
Drive my own car, I don't like the valet
Park then I go into my mind with an AK
Shoot every thought in my head then it rotates
Losin' it all, but I think that I'm okay
Who is involved? I don't know, but I'm insane
Poof! And I'm gone, wanna call me a no name, what!?
I'm prolly not what you thought
I'm prolly not what you thought
I used to judge everybody that wasn't like me 'til I learned it was wrong
Girl told me I should get it together and get out the dark
I'm tryna give her my heart
That's when I sit in my car, writin' for hours until I can barely talk
I mean, where do I start?
Feels like I'm fallin' apart
Act like my image is hard
I always put up my guard
Even when talkin' to God
Sit in my room and I plot
Everything that I'm not
Comes out in the music I jot
I give it all that I got
I give it all that I got!
I'm tryna think out the box, no!
Yeah, I got people standing outside a bus screaming my name
I don't come out and take pictures, they tell me I changed
I don't smile in VIPs, you get mad like, "You know what I paid?"
Guess I don't know what to say
Guess I don't know what to say
I leave it all on the stage
I leave it all on the stage
Woke up in the cell, where am I at?
Yeah, it's cold, but I like that
What am I, trapped?
Heart's beating out of my chest
Door's locked, but the keys are in my hands
Hm, yeah, that's weird, it doesn't make sense, does it?
I make songs, I don't make friends—judge me
Might smile, but it ain't that funny
Sing along to the pain, they love it
Life's like a merry-go-round
And I'm still tryna figure it out
I like space, I don't fit in the crowds
My whole life I've been airin' it out
Oh, I'm gettin' into character now
Feels wrong, but it feels right
My feelings seal tight real nice
But I will fight anything to win
But I'm not Mike Tyson, I won't bite ya
But I will tell you if I don't like you
I am not the norm
I got my own shoes, I ain't tryna fit in yours
I never been married, but I've felt divorced
Hi, I'm Nate, have we met before?
Somebody told you I was wack? Check the source
Somebody told you I was back? Yes, of course
You got a problem with the fans? There's the door
You lookin' for the old me? Check the morgue, agh!
Not a fortune-teller, but I can see into the future better
Ain't no tellin' what'll happen when I pick up the microphone, get the fans together
Same style, but the songs are better
Been a year and a half, feels like it's gone forever
Ain't no drink in my hand, but you know the buzz is comin'
Big steps in the game, yeah, the Hulk is running
My thoughts are funny, it feels like I'm onto something, yeah

I'm high off the music, my head's in the clouds
I kinda like it up here; I am not comin' down
I'd rather be alone, I am not good in crowds
Which is kinda confusin', I know—been that way since a child
They laughin', they tell me I'll never get out
I'm just tryna be me, I am nobody else
I don't care what you think, I'm just bein' myself
So I guess for now

I'll just be the outcast
I'll just be the outcast
I'll just be the outcast
I guess I'll be the outcast

Yeah, I guess I don't fit the mold of rap
'Cause I'm respectin' women
"I heard your record, I was laughin at it"
Maybe they would like me more if I got a little graphic with it
Nah, I don't wanna blend in with you little rappin' idiots—I'd rather be the outcast
I ain't never puttin' out trash
I take a hundred and staple it right to my tongue
I always put the money where my mouth's at, agh!
Feels good to be here now
I'm a weird person with a weird crowd
What, you don't like that?
That's cool, that's great, that's fine, okay, you can leave now
Got a weird smile, but I like it though
I paint it on me and I'm walkin' to the microphone
And put the caution tape around me like I did in Intro 1, yeah!
Yeah, they got me reminiscin' now!
Yeah, you done know I'm 'bout to go mad
Never wanted something so bad
Goosebumps through the whole track
Ain't no way I'm gonna hold back
Got me thinkin' that I'm cookin' in a meth lab
I don't blow it up in front of my own eyes
You look a little lost, you ain't get that?
Comin' from a town where nobody is a rapper
Guess I never get the memo, must've missed that
Wow!
Here I go in my feelings again, I can feel it again
So I lay in my bed, in my cell with the pen
And I dwell on my sins, I keep wonderin' when
Time to open the the doors, they don't know who I am
But I pick up the keys and I put on my Timbs
And I stare at the locks and the tat on my skin
And I think to myself, "I don't wanna fit in"

I'm high off the music, my head's in the clouds
I kinda like it up here; I am not comin' down
I'd rather be alone, I am not good in crowds
Which is kinda confusin', I know—been that way since a child
They laughin', they tell me I'll never get out
I'm just tryna be me, I am nobody else
I don't care what you think, I'm just bein' myself
So I guess for now

Yeah, I'll just be the outcast
I'll just be the outcast
I'll just be the outcast
I guess I'll be the outcast

Yeah, tryna focus
Take a knife to my head then I cut it open
Take my brain, put it on the floor—tryna figure out my motives
Y'all thought I was an issue when the door was locked
Nah, you should see me when the door opens
Every night I can hear voices
Put a camera in my face, might turn Joker like I'm Mike Posner
Always been a little complex
Difficult to process
Some of y'all wanna sit around and try to pick apart my bars
Here's some lines you could dissect:
If I'ma die, I'ma die givin' everything that I have
Take a deep breath, I don't need y'all's respect
I'm a reject kid at recess playin' games with his make-believe friends
Yeah, I don't ever take a night off
Lights off in the room and I write songs
I might fall into my thoughts once in a while when the mic's off
You ain't ever seen no drive like mine, better hop outta my car
I'm about to unlock my doors
You ain't got a seat belt on, better find one
Gettin' sick of people tellin' me to smile more
T.S. was a chapter I'll never forget, it was therapy for me
But it's time to turn the page now
Hey, shut up! I'm tryna tell 'em my story!
I'm sorry, I wasn't yellin' at y'all, I was talkin' to the voices
I rip out the drums of the industry's ears for tryin' to ignore me and playin' while singin' this chorus

I'll just be the outcast
I'll just be the outcast
I'll just be the outcast
I guess I'll be the outcast

I'll just be the outcast
I'll just be the outcast
I'll just be the outcast
I guess I'll be the outcast
Yeah, most of my life's full of sad days
Started at a young age
Yeah, bought a house but I've been livin' on stage
Tryna find the real me, I ain't found it yet
Wake up every morning feelin' like I'm guilty
Talk to God, "Can You hear me?"
Lately, I'm a mess
I don't want no one to help me
Yeah, I don't want no one to help me and

If you think that I make decisions based off of what you think, then you're wrong
Can't nobody think for me, I got my own thoughts
Sometimes you don't know what you had until it's all gone, till it's all gone
If I took the hand that was dealt me then I would be nowhere in life
Yeah, I had to think smart
Threw away the deck and got my own cards
Long before I had the money to afford a car

I–I've been doin' me (yeah)
I've been doin' me
Yeah, I've been doin' me
I've been doin' me
Followin' my dreams
Yeah, I've been doin' me
I've been doin' me
I've been doin' me
Yeah, I've been doin' me
I've been doin' me
Followin' my dreams
Yeah, I've been doin' me

Most of my life's full of regrets
Things I wanna take back, yeah
Wrote you a letter, wish that I had never sent that
Didn't even make sense, I don't even know
All I know is I get lower on the weekends
They tell me I should make friends, I just sit at home
Lately, I've been off the deep end, yeah
I've been off the deep end and

If you think that I'm 'bout to change who I am just for you then you're so wrong
As a kid I built a house around my broke heart
Sometimes you don't know what you had until it falls apart, till it falls apart
If I took the hand that was dealt me then I would be nowhere in life
Yeah, I had to think smart
Threw away the deck and got my own cards
Long before I had the money to afford a car

I (yeah)–I've been doin' me (oh, yeah)
I've been doin' me
Yeah, I've been doin' me (I have been)
I've been doin' me
Followin' my dreams
Yeah, I've been doin' me (followin' my)
I've been doin' me
I've been doin' me (I've been followin' my)
Yeah, I've been doin' me
Followin' my dreams
Yeah, I'm just doin' me
Yeah, I'm just doin' me

Yeah, I'm reminiscin' back to both of us laughin'
Playin' old records, thinkin' every one of 'em's classic
Windows down, we on the street up in Michigan rappin'
We talked about it, but never really knew it could happen
My confidence about as low as the gas is
We didn't have the money for it, so we'd turn the key backwards and sit in parking lots for hours till the battery crashes
I think that we related 'cause both of us were lookin' for answers
A couple months ago I drove into Gladwin, got me all in my feelings
It's somethin' 'bout bein' somewhere that's familiar
Pull in the gas station, open up the tank then I fill it then laugh
Would I move back? Mm, not in a million, but I appreciate the memories we had
I know you've been callin', sorry I never call back
I know I've been distant, you know I never meant that
You can tell the family how I'm doing if they ask
I'm just doin' me
Cold nights, cold nights, long night
Staring down at an empty cup like
I'ma fill, I'ma fill it up
All night, all night
Ten feet down nearly my whole life
But I'll be rising, rising up

Yeah, I know the person in the mirror's not a perfect one
I look at him every day and think he's not enough
My life's a book that I don't really like to open up
I'm twenty-six, but I feel like I live in chapter one
I skim through it, I've been through it, they laugh at us
You think it's funny, yeah, laugh it up
I always felt like no one listened to me, that's how I grew up
Church is where I found God, but it's also where I learned to judge
Yeah, I had to learn there's a difference between
What you want, and what you really need
I've always been motivated by comments from people tellin' me
Things they think I'll never be, and then I become it, this is my everything
There's so much that goes on in my head that people will never see
You probably be terrified of my memories, don't lecture me
Let me be, let me see, let me breathe, how they remember me
Doesn't alter who I am as a person to take my energy, yeah

Hard days, cold nights
Staring down at an empty cup like
I'ma fill, I'ma fill it up
All day, all night
Ten feet down nearly my whole life
But I'll be rising, rising up
Cold nights

Yeah, my fans made me who I am, but they also deceived me
I've been allowed to live life like I'm already grieving
I'm at a table of lies, but don't eat what they feed me
My hoodie over my face, so nobody can see me
I'm on a plane, 'bout to fly again
Looking out the window, take a moment to admire it
Wondering how high it is, wonder where the time has went
Then I shut the window and go back to feeling like I'm out my mind again, agh!
Yeah, seems like we're all trying to climb a ladder
It's crazy what we'll do to climb it faster
It's like we throw away the things in life that really matter
Just so we could make it to the top and wonder what we're even climbing after
I know the feeling of feeling like everything that you deal with
Don't never change, that's part of being a human, yeah
Life's what you make of it, take it, embrace it, and take it, and savor it
Ain't about what you did, it's what you became from it, agh!

Hard days, cold nights
Staring down at an empty cup like
I'ma fill, I'ma fill it up (oh, yeah)
All day, all night
Ten feet down nearly my whole life
But I'll be rising, rising up
Cold nights

We all want what we never had
The good life doesn't seem so bad
The good life doesn't seem so sad
Yeah, we all want what we never had, whoa

Hard days, cold nights
Staring down at an empty cup like
I'ma fill, I'ma fill it up
All day, all night
Ten feet down nearly my whole life
But I'll be rising, rising up

We all want what we never had
The good life doesn't seem so bad
The good life doesn't seem so sad
Yeah, we all want what we never had

Hard days, cold nights
Staring down at an empty cup like
I'ma fill, I'ma fill it up

Cold nights, cold nights, long night
Staring down at an empty cup like
I'ma fill, I'ma fill it up
All night, all night
Ten feet down nearly my whole life
But I'll be rising, rising up
All I ever wanted was somebody to hear me
And all I ever wanted was somebody to feel me
And everybody wanna tell me that I'm out of my head
When I'm on the mic, that's fine, but that don't scare me
It's been a long time, but I'm back now
Rap pow, welcome to the rap house
Rap pow, will live 'til I pass out
Blackout, blackout, everybody keep on wonderin' if I still rap now
Are you serious?
Anybody out there hearin' this?
Yo, I came in the game as a lyricist
And I'ma leave like that, period
You sniff lines, I write lines
You've now entered in my mind
And you better get ready cause you might find
I'm from a different place, and my kind
It's a little bit different than yours is
Quit snoring, hip-hop isn't dead
It's just been in mournin'
From the moment I quit recording
Quick, record this
Listen, I'm warming up and you're misinformed if
You think that I'm slipping up, this ain't sick enough
Then I'll skip the chorus
I've been here, ain't nobody heard of me?
Yeah I'ma turn this beat to a murder scene
I don't live for the world
I live for the King, I live for the King, focus
Wrote this with emotion
It's hard to get a break when the doors ain't open
It's hard to get a shot when the gun ain't loaded
And it's hard to make a living when nobody wanna notice, hold it
What am I insane maybe? Plain crazy
You put me in a room with a mic you will not restrain me
You do what you wanted but you can't contain me, lazy
Is not a character trait of mine, don't wait in line
This is the current condition of my state of mind

Don't tell me that this isn't real
Don't tell me this ain't how I feel
This is all I have, all I have

All I ever wanted was somebody to get this
All I ever wanted was somebody to play this
Yeah, take my song, put it on their playlist
And get goosebumps every time they play it, rate us
If that's my calling or not, Father, maybe I should just not bother
Go back to that nine-to-five, but I am not a
Quitter so quit that
I never been a killer but I guarantee I kill tracks
Put them in a coffin, lost in, rip that
Tryin' to make an impact in rap, is that insane?
Well, I guess so
Rap though, better give me that pencil
And you ain't ever gonna make it, it's all mental
I am in a place where I can't let go, agh!
I still work a job and do this, and y'all know what's stupid?
I thought all you had to do was get a record deal, and, your things start moving
But that's not the case, because most of the times—the artists you hear
You keep on thinking that artist is new, but that artist has prolly been at it for years
Yeah, in the back of my mind thinking, am I wasting my time dreamin'?
And I ain't got no money in my wallet, but I guarantee there ain't no way that I am gonna leave this
I need this, I swear to y'all, I need this
And this hip-hop's in my veins, if you cut me I'ma bleed it
And, yo, what you think I write write raps for? No reason? No
Take my pain and I put 'em in a song—ever since them pills, they took my mom
I've been a different person, don't try to predict my verses
What you're hearing now is me whether I'm in front or behind that curtain
I stand behind these words here, I'm a Christian but I'm not perfect
Don't tell me to calm down, I'm calm now, listen, I'm just working
Yeah, it might take a minute to get it, but once you get it everything will be crystal clear
I don't think they see my vision here, I don't think they see my vision here!

Don't tell me that this isn't real
Don't tell me this ain't how I feel
This is all I have, all I have
Don't tell me that this isn't real
Don't tell me this ain't how I feel
This is all I have, all I have
Don't tell me that this isn't real
Don't tell me this ain't how I feel
This is all I have, all I have
All I have
Don't tell me that this isn't real (this isn't real, this isn't real)
This is all that I have, this is all that I have
Started with phone conversations and I
Flew out to see you, it's raining outside
We sat by the water and talked about life
Oh
Said you lost your dad, girl I know how that feels
I lost my mom, tryna deal with that still
I guess we connect on our hatred for pills
It's real

I got you on my mind, baby
I got you on my mind, baby
I got you on my mind, baby
I got you on my mind, I got you on my mind
I got you on my mind, baby
I got you on my mind, I got you on my mind

You got me thinking things I never used to
I'm not the phone type, I'd rather be with you
Sometimes I hold back from saying, "I miss you"
But I miss you
I have to admit, on this road I get lonely
But you make me smile every time that you call me
You let me be myself
You don't control me

I got you on my mind, baby
I got you on my mind, I got you on my mind
I got you on my mind, baby
I got you on my mind, I got you on my mind
I got you on my mind, baby
I got you on my mind, I got you on my mind
I got you on my mind, baby
I got you on my mind, I got you on my mind

Laying in my bed, I'm just staring at the ceiling, baby
I just wanna know if you feel what I'm feeling, baby
Got you on my mind yeah, tell me what the deal is lately
Yeah, deal is lately, deal is lately
I'm a man of my word, girl believe that
I'm a closed book but somehow you learn to read that
Know that I should relax, hate the way I react
Thinking that I'm good but you know I'm 'bout to relapse
Thinking that I'm good but you know I'm 'bout to relapse
Girl I wake up in the morning', all I can think of is you

I got you on my mind, baby
I got you on my mind, I got you on my mind
I got you on my mind, baby
I got you on my mind, I got you on my mind
I got you on my mind, baby
I got you on my mind, I got you on my mind
I got you on my mind, baby
I got you on my mind, I got you on my mind
Yeah (haha)
My name buzzin', ain't no way you could ignore it
I did not come this far so they could ignore me
I am not the one to say, "I'll do it in the mornin'"
I'd rather get it done, don't focus on what's not important
They try to talk to me like they been nothin' but supportive
Appreciate the love, but do not show up on my doorstep
If you ain't about that real, I suggest that you avoid me
If we ain't on the same page, that's the end of story, agh!
You are not a baller 'cause your closet's full of Jordan's
You are not a rich man 'cause you're on the Forbes list
First, I dropped a record, then you know I gotta tour it
Real's still the slogan, only difference is there's more of us
The story of my life feels like it's just beginnin' now
I ask you a question, I want answers, not the run-around
You the one that brought it up, but I'm the one to shut it down
If you ain't got the album yet, I brought you one, I'm at your house
Hey!

All I see is green lights (woo!)
All I see is green lights (oh yeah!)
All I spit is real life (yeah!)
Bet you don't know what that's like (huh?)
All I see is green lights (yeah!), woo!
All I see is green lights, (woo!), yeah
All I spit is real life
I bet you don't know what that's like

Yeah
I know where I'm goin', I don't let no one distract me
I don't need directions from nobody in the back seat
I don't need these people in my corner tryna gas me
I'd rather have people in my corner tryna check me
Yeah, I walk off the bus a different city than the last week
Let the fans speak, they gon' tell you 'bout the past me
If I'm bein' honest, last year I was in a bad place
Wouldn't say I'm out of it, but don't feel like I can't be, agh!
Who you know droppin' clean records, but they nasty?
I was made for this, I could tell when Mama had me
I hopped right off the table, told my doctor, "I ain't average."
He asked me, "What does that mean?"
I told him, "Get the pen and pad, please."
Who'd a known I'd write something that could change lives?
I don't think y'all fully understand the way you changed mine
I look at the future that's in front of me with both eyes
Three records, three years, I don't like to waste time
Oh yeah!

All I see is green lights, yeah! (woo!)
All I see is green lights, haha!
All I spit is real life (real life)
Bet you don't know what that's like (you don't know!)
All I see is green lights (green lights), woo!
All I see is green lights (green lights—haha), yeah!
All I spit is real life (oh, real life!)
I bet you don't know what that's like (no!)

Hey!
Haha!
All I see is—green lights!
Yeah!
Oh my!
Yeah! (haha)
This may be the last sunset I'll see
So I'll take it in, I'll take it in
This may be the last air that I'll breathe
So I'll breathe it in, I'll breathe it in

I heard that pictures don't change
Just the people inside of 'em do
Whoever told you that life would be easy
I promise that person was lyin' to you
You got a problem with followin' through
That's why I got a problem with followin' you
You keep lookin' at me like this problem is new
But we've been here before, what you tryin' to do?
Don't talk to me like I don't know what you feeling
'Cause I was there with you back in the beginning
Quit looking away when I talk, let me finish
I'm tryna be honest, you're tryna forget me, ugh
What's wrong with you, hey?
I know that you got a lot on your plate
You keep telling me I should get out of your way
But I can't see how you gon' lie to my face
Don't tell me you fine
'Cause I know that you not, so don't even try it
And what we gon' live for in this life full of pain
'Til we're eighty and one day we'll get up and say we regretted our lives
'Cause that's where we're going
And do not pretend like you don't even notice
The funny thing is that you already know it
I'm starting to think that you like how it feels to be lost in the moment

Lost, lost in the moment
Lost in the moment, lost in the moment
And get lost, lost in the moment
Lost in the moment, lost in the moment

Yeah, they told us that time flies, didn't know what it means
Now I feel like we just running around tryna
Catch it and hoping to cut off it's wings
But that ain't gon' happen
Joy, when was the last time we had it?
I don't remember 'cause all that we do
Is go backwards, but that's what you get
When you live in the past tense
And I know we breathing but we not alive
Really, is this the way we wanna die?
'Till you got everything bottled inside
If only they knew what goes on in our minds
I know what you thinking so don't try to hide
Why do you look at me like you surprised?
If you really mean what you write in these lines
Then why don't you fix it, 'cause I'm getting tired!
Yeah, I can no longer do this
Ever since you fell in love with the music
See? You find a way to express what you feel
But the moment that you get away from the mic, you don't know what you doing
Is it clear to you yet?
I don't know what's going on in your head
But eventually, you'll have to deal with the things
That you talk about yeah, but I guess until then, we're lost!

Lost, lost in the moment
Lost in the moment, lost in the moment
And get lost, lost in the moment
Lost in the moment, lost in the moment

Yeah, oh, yeah, oh lost
Oh, yeah, oh, no no
This may be the last sunset I'll see
So I'll take it in, I'll take it in
This may be the last air that I'll breathe
So I'll breathe it in, I'll breathe it in
Too many faces, too many faces, too many faces

Yeah, what's your definition of success? (ayy!)
I don't trust the thoughts that come inside my head (woo!)
I don't trust this thing that beats inside my chest
Who I am and who I wanna be cannot connect; why?
Don't think I deserve it? You get no respect (woo!)
I just made a couple mil', still not impressed
Let You Down goes triple platinum, yeah, okay, okay, I guess (ayy!)
Smile for a moment then these questions startin' to fill my head, not again!
I push away the people that I love the most; why? (woo!)
I don't want no one to know I'm vulnerable; why? (woo!)
That makes me feel weak and so uncomfortable; why? (ayy!)
Stop askin' me questions, I just wanna feel alive
Until I die—this isn't Nate's flow (woo!)
Just let me rhyme; I'm in disguise
I'm a busy person, got no time for lies; one of a kind
They don't see it; I pull out they eyes; I'm on the rise!
I've been doin' this for most my life with no advice (woo!)
Take my chances, I just roll the dice, do what I like
As a kid, I was afraid of heights, put that aside
Now I'm here and they look so surprised, well so am I, woo!
They don't invite me to the parties but I still arrive
Kick down the door and then I go inside
Give off that "I do not belong here" vibe
Then take the keys right off the counter, let's go for a ride
Why do y'all look mortified? (ayy!)
I keep to myself, they think I'm sorta shy, organized
Let You Down's the only song you've heard of? Well then you're behind (woo!)
Story time; wish that I could think like Big Sean does, but I just can't decide (aah!)
If I should stick my knife inside of Pennywise
I, I don't care what anybody else thinks—lies (haha!)
I do not need nobody to help me—lies
I kinda feel guilty 'cause I'm wealthy; why?
I don't understand, it's got me questionin' like, "Why?
Just tell me why"—not back to this flow
Inside I feel divided
Back when I ain't had a dime, but had the drive
Back before I ever signed, I questioned life, like, "Who am I, man?" Woo!
Nothin' to me's ever good enough
I could be workin' for twenty-four hours a day and think I never did enough
My life is a movie but there ain't no tellin' what you're gonna see in my cinema (no!)
I wanna be great but I get it in the way of myself and I think about everything that I could never be
Why do I do it though? Ayy, yeah
Why you always lookin' aggravated?
Not a choice, you know I had to make it
When they talk about the greatest, they gon' probably never put us in the conversation
Like somethin' then I gotta take it
Write somethin' then I might erase it
I love it, then I really hate it
What's the problem, Nathan? I don't know!
I know I like to preach to always be yourself (yeah)
But my emotions make me feel like I am someone else
Me and pride had made a pact that we don't need no help
Which feels like I'm at war inside myself but I forgot the shells
I hold my issues up for all to see, like show and tell
A lot of people know me, but not a lot know me well
Hold my issues up for all to see, like show and tell
A lot of people know me, but they don't know me well

Too many faces, too many faces, too many faces
Yeah, you, baby, you
You're something special
Baby, I know
I know what you're thinkin'
Maybe, maybe I'm wasting your time
But I promise, but I promise
I know that I go back and forth
But I won't let you, I won't let you, I won't let you down
Yeah

I meant it when I told you I would change
Meant it when I told you I would stay
Sick of talkin' on the phone, babe
Time to pack your car and come to my state
Come to my place, look at my face, oh, yeah
You know I ain't playin'
I'm savin' some money, yeah, hop in the car
And get on the road, here we go
Baby, I can't lie
I'm a little bit, I'm a little bit scared right now, girl, girl, yeah

You said you want more
And I can't blame you for
Askin' me what's somethin' you deserve

You're special
Yo-yo-you're special
Oh yeah, you're special
Yo-yo-you're special

Yeah, I knew it, you was my type
We ain't gotta skip to the highlight
You're the highlight, girl, of my life (woo)
Both of us have got a past, but it's alright
All night car rides
Drivin' through the city, yeah, the view's fantastic
It's automatic, could see you smile, gotta have it
She got me thinkin' maybe I'ma have to put a ring on it, girl
I ain't never been a romantic, but I can romance ya'
Get your shoes on, baby, I am not asking
I'm 'bout to take you out to dinner, put the black dress on
Got the room gaspin', how did this happen?
I don't even know
She's the type to sing my words at the show
She's the type to pick me up when I'm low
And remind me she got my back, no matter what
Yeah, I think she hearin' me now
Say what I think, so I'm thinkin' out loud
I need a woman I know I can trust, and I got one
I guess you can say that she down
Callin' my phone, and she told me she proud
She said my name and I like how that sounds, oh, yeah
(I like that)

I like how this sounds
(Baby, I—yeah)
Baby, don't make me lose myself
Baby, I need somebody I know I can trust (yeah)
I mean, I'm being honest
I ain't ever met a girl like you (no)
Baby, you can call me
You can call me anytime
You can call me any day, anytime
You know I'ma answer
I won't let you, I won't let you down, yeah

You said you want more
And I can't blame you for
Askin' me for somethin' you deserve (You deserve it)

You're special, yeah
Yo-yo-you're special
I said, girl, I said, you're special
I said, you're special
I'm dedicated, the definition of dedication
Wrote this whole record while I was levitating
Sittin' in my room with the pen and paper, I'm innovative
They've been afraid of me since I was a second grader
I'm the kid on the playground mama told you to never play with
There's levels of music—and I'm in the elevator
Going up to the top floor, look how we elevated
What, you don't know the brand by now? You better get educated
Take both of my arms, rip 'em out the sockets and separate 'em
Forgive me, yeah, I know I get animated
Don't matter, I still write a better record than yours without a hesitation
Never been more motivated
Just look at all the minds I have opened and penetrated
See, I am the voice of all these kids that think things, but never say 'em
That's why they come to my shows wearing the NF hoodies and hats low like we're carrying weapons, ah!
Put the controllers away, it's game over
I promise I'm way colder
The fans keep saying that they're hungry for new music
Well that's pretty convenient 'cause I just made a plate for 'em
And I don't hear what none of y'all are saying
I just sit at the keys feeling the music
Got me thinking I'm Beethoven
The game needs a makeover
If you've been waiting, the wait's over
You ain't notice, y'all about to witness a takeover, I'm home!
Yeah, they waiting on me to match the
Emotion that I had in the last one
What if I don't, they gon' tell me that I'm losing my passion?
If I do, am I repeating my actions?
Yeah, look, "How Could You Leave Us" is massive
There ain't nothing I can write that'll match that
My biggest fear writing this record wasn't putting out trash
It was disappointing myself and the fanbase
Now I want you to picture me:
I'm in a hotel rapping, crying on the floor of the bathroom
Staring in the mirror, my room, hands shaking playing "How Could You Leave Us" through the speakers on my iPhone
Tryna figure out if I'ma always feel the way that I feel or maybe someday I can learn to be happy
Or maybe I can't be, 'cause if the music ain't emotional enough, are they gon' call me a has-been?
Pain's always been the root of my music
If I cut it off, how am I supposed to keep growing
If I let it go, won't my whole career be in ruins?
That's when I realized this whole conversation is stupid
I never cared to impress people that don't even know me
I just write what I feel, somehow it started a movement
Trying to enjoy a career, but I don't know how to do it
When I spend all of my time being afraid I'ma lose it!
But, then I figured out the reason they follow me
The reason why these fans surrounding me
It's not 'cause I'm a "Rap God"
I don't need you people to bow to me
All they ever did was doubt on me, now everyone's proud of me
Acknowledge me or not, you ain't ignoring the following
I'm just teaching 'em something they couldn't learn in they colleges
This is for the kids feeling like they live at the bottom and every day of they lives, feels like it's darker than Halloween!
Yeah, you ain't alone out there, look around you—we got a lot of fans in here
Couple hundred thousand, that's what we did last year
Listen to Intro III, trying to kill my fear
They'll get that in a minute
We about to shatter the critics
I am a savage, admit it
A lot of baggage I live in
That's why the passion is different
Really don't care if they get it
We're only three records in it and this is just the beginning
I'm home!

Real music
You spend your life in a dream that you can't escape
'Cause you live your life in a coma, you're never awake
If you'd open your eyes then maybe you'd see what's at stake
You're sleeping, you're sleeping

You make a lot of money and you live in a mansion
And pretty much got everything that you could ever imagine
But you feel like even though you got everything in the world
You got nothing
So what you do then is you start going backwards
You runnin' in a direction
And you lookin' for something that isn't real
And all you know is that you just gotta have it
What you're doin' is sleepin'
And thinking that you're awake and you're not
And the problem is that you don't know what you're after
So you put everything that you have into what you do
Hoping that one day maybe you don't have to feel like you're empty
But as you get older a lot of weight on your shoulders is getting heavy
Then you look back and you start to regret things
You only get one life
And every time you lookin' at yours
You feel like everything you have is a waste!
And the problem and the reason you could never fill a hole in your life
Is because you were never awake

You spend your life in a dream that you can't escape
'Cause you live your life in a coma, you're never awake

Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!

You wake up in the morning
But you feel like you never got up and go to work
And you feelin' like you ain't got a purpose
And you tryna get motivated but everything you do turns into a mess
Like you ain't nothing but worthless
And, yo, you look around
A lot of these other people you lookin' at
To you, you describe as perfect
So you point a finger at God and tell him to do his job
And fix ya life up 'cause nothin' is workin'!
And you will try to hide it and make it seem like it's nothin'
But really you feel like everything is crashin' around you
And you developed a problem in trusting in other people
Which later became an issue that would mentally pound you!
You only get one life
But every time you lookin' at yours you feel like all you ever see are mistakes
And the problem and the reason you could never move forward in life
Is because you were never awake!
Wake up

You spend your life in a dream that you can't escape
'Cause you live your life in a coma, you're never awake

Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!

You spend your life in a dream that you can't escape
'Cause you live your life in a coma, you're never awake
Only time you ever call me is when you feelin’ like don't nobody else wanna listen
When’s the last time you saw me
You probably don’t remember that ’cause that was back then you were different
I don’t wanna hear the sorry’s
I’m tired of all the talkin’ to be honest I would rather see a difference
Yeah, you pass me in the hallway
But you ain’t say a word to me
Lately all I ever feel is distant
You don’t care that you lost me
What’s wrong with ya
Had a picture of you sittin’ on the dash in the car with me
Now it’s in my closet with the other ones sittin’ in a box
I don’t wanna open up
You took it all from me
Told me you would die for me
Yeah, all you ever do is lie to me
Wish that I could say that this has come as surprise see to me
Told me that I never took the time and now you ain’t got the time for me
Yeah

I just wanna know oh, oh, oh, oh
When did you get so cold oh, oh, oh
What happened to your soul oh oh  oh
Don’t you see me

We used to talk like best friends
I remember that I guess I don’t know what happened to us
Now you got me questionin’ what trust is
You told me you would be there for me
Yeah, but you ain’t really mean it did ya
Now you wanna jump ship
Leave me here alone
Well, I’m used to it
Everybody else did
Who you havin’ fun with
Don’t tell me I don't wanna know every time I ask I just feel sick
You're the one that jumped in
Told me you had some feelins
Now you tryin’ to tell me that is not true
I ain’t gotta clue
Who I’m lookin’ at right now, but I know the person that I’m lookin’ at is not you
Yeah
They say that you are who you hang with
Maybe that’s the reason you been changin’
Maybe that’s the reason why I’m feelin’ like you’re dangerous
And every time we talk it’s like I’m talkin’ to a stranger

I just wanna know oh, oh, oh, oh
When did you get so cold oh, oh, oh
What happened to your soul oh oh  oh
Don’t you see me
I thought that we were close oh, oh
But now that door is closed oh, oh
When did we lose control oh, oh, oh
Guess you don’t need me
I just wanna know oh, oh, oh, oh
When did you get so cold oh, oh, oh
What happened to your soul oh oh  oh
Don’t you see me
I thought that we were close oh, oh
But now that door is closed oh, oh
When did we lose control oh, oh, oh
Guess you don’t need me
Yeah, look

I mean this with love when I say it
I wanna answer the phone when you call me
The problem is, it's 10 a.m. and you're already drinkin'
You're probably already wasted
What's the point in having conversation with somebody that
Won't remember we had conversations, yeah, we always talk about the same things, we just say 'em different
Try to fix it, crazy, isn't it?
You say, "Mom was always proud" and played the videos of us as kids, I get it
I think that both of us live in the past, so we take for granted the present
Maybe next time I'm in Michigan, I'll come and visit
We ain't got a lot in common but both of us miss her
We could sit inside your smoke-filled livin' room, and tear up together, that's real

I might do some things you don't like
We all make mistakes, that's just life
They might say I changed, that's alright
That's alright, that's alright
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life
My life, my life

You know my patience is very thin
Wish I was there again
I'm not embarrassed to say that we've always had issues
I'm embarrassed to say that we never took care of 'em, yeah
Pain will always find its way to the surface
No matter how deep you bury him
Growin' up, I felt like no one ever really got me, eventually
I took that out on relationships (woo)
I put my arm around you, and I mean it, I love you to death
These are the moments I know I'ma always hold onto and cherish 'em, yeah
Life's about taking chances, making moves
Not about what you did, it's what you do
Build on what you got and learn from what you lose
And never let people distract you from being you

I might do some things you don't like
We all make mistakes, that's just life
They might say I changed, that's alright
That's alright, that's alright
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life
My life, my life

That's just my, that's just my, that's just my
That's just my, that's just my, that's just my
That's just my, that's just my, that's just my
(Oh no no no) Yeah
That's just my, that's just my, that's just my
That's just my, that's just my, that's just my
That's just my, that's just my, that's just my
Life

That's just my life, my life, my life, my life
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life
My life, my life
(Yeah!) I'm back, did anyone miss me?
They said the second record can be tricky
Well, that's kind of funny, 'cause I am not trippin'
My fans—they know what it is and they with me
Yeah, I ain't the type that's gon' ride with the semi
I came from a town with three lights and no city
I've been doing shows for nothin' but pennies
When I leave the stage, they never forget me
Mansion was a glimpse of my life
I let you see what it's like to be in my head
People ask me what I think I think I'd be doin'
If it wasn't music, I'd rather be dead, agh!
You heard what I said, that was like me at a three
You don't wanna see me at ten
Or maybe you do
I promise if that is the case, then that is what y'all gonna get
If you're looking for music with watered down lyrics
I promise that you need to go somewhere else
And if you want somebody to tell you everything
That you wanna hear, I won't be any help
This flow is familiar, I think I heard it before
Yeah, I made it myself!
I left the door open to come in my mansion
But I never said it's a beautiful house
Some of y'all sat on the porch
Looked at my windows and stared at my door
They ask me if I'm gonna kill it this record
I laugh in their face and I ask 'em, "Do you see the blood on the floors?"
"He's at it again"
"NF is crazy, he's bad for the kids"
"He never talks about nothing but him"
"And my friends say, 'He's kind of a diva.'"
Well, you need to get some new friends
I'm as chill as it gets
'Til I get on the stage and flip on the switch
And I go to a place where nobody is
If you bring up my name in a song, that's something that you will regret
Learned a lot in a year
I remember the shows when no one was there
I remember the shows when nobody cared
Some people in front of me laughing like, "He isn't going nowhere."
It's funny now, isn't it?
This type of life isn't how I envisioned it
This type of life, it just ain't how I pictured it
I'm in the back of the tour bus
Tryin' to FaceTime my family, it's different
Not what you think it is
Write a review, tell me what you think of this
Give me three stars and call me an idiot
But to be honest, it don't make a difference
I know some people don't get it
But you have now entered a therapy session
If you don't like music that's personal
I have no clue what you people are doin' here, might as well throw out the record
I pull up a chair, I talk to my music like nobody's there
Only person I judge is the one in the mirror
And lately, he ain't doin' well
I don't need y'all in my ear
I'm tired of hearin' it
You call it music, I call her my therapist
She keep on telling me I have been carryin'
Way too much baggage, I need to take care of it
I know she's right, but, man, it's embarrassing
Music has raised me more than my parent did
Take out a picture of us and I stare at it
Who am I kiddin'? You probably ain't hearin' this
Show me an artist you wanna compare me with
You put us both on a track, I'ma bury 'em
Give me the shovel, it's 'bout to get scarier
None of you want it with rap, who you staring at?
I see you got beats, but where is the lyrics at?
NF is the logo, you know I've been wearin' that
Don't come to my show and be sittin' that very back
I call you out in the crowd like, "There he is!"
Thought I'd be happy, it feels like I'm cursed
It's hard to be clean when you play in the dirt
You gave me this place to go when I'm hurtin'
I thought it'd get better, but it's getting worse
And I got nobody to blame when I work
Like 24/7, I ain't been to church
And Satan keep callin' me, he tryna flirt
I hang up the phone, these are more than just words
I drive on that highway and listen to Mansion
I look up to God like, "When did this happen?"
Yellin' with all of my fans to wake up
But feel like I haven't
I get emotional, I didn't plan this
I'm doing things I never imagined
I'm sorry, but I gotta leave
I don't wanna be late for my therapy session, agh!
When I die, put my ashes in a trash bag
I don't care where they go
Don't waste your money on my gravestone
I'm more concerned about my soul
Everybody's gon' die
Don't everybody live though
Sometimes I look up to the sky
And wonder…

"Do you see us down here, oh Lord (oh Lord)? Oh Lord?"
"Do you see us down here, oh Lord (oh Lord)? Oh Lord?"
"Do you see us down here, oh Lord (oh Lord, oh)? Oh Lord?"
"Do you see us down here, oh Lord (oh Lord, oh)? Oh Lord?"

Listen! Yeah, everybody wants change
Don't nobody wanna change though
Don't nobody wanna pray
'Til they got something to pray for
Know everybody's gon' die
But don't everybody live though
Sometimes I look up to the sky
And wonder…

"Do you see us down here, oh Lord (oh Lord)? Oh Lord?"
"Do you see us down here, oh Lord (oh Lord)? Oh Lord?"
"Do you see us down here, oh Lord (oh Lord, oh)? Oh Lord?"
"Do you see us down here, oh Lord (oh Lord, oh)? Oh Lord?"

It's easy to blame God, but harder to fix things
We look in the sky like, "Why ain't you listening?"
Watchin' the news in our livin' rooms on the big screens
And talking 'bout, "If God's really real, then where is he?"
You see the same God that we're sayin' might not even exist
Becomes real to us, but only when we dyin' in bed
When you're healthy, it's like, we don't really care for Him then
Leave me alone God, I'll call you when I need you again
Which is funny, everyone will sleep in the pews
Then blame God for our problems like he's sleeping on you
We turn our backs on him, what do you expect him to do?
It's hard to answer prayers when nobody's prayin' to you
I look around at this world we walk on
It's a smack in the face, don't ever tell me there's no God
And if there isn't then what are we here for?
And what are y'all doing down there? I don't know, Lord

"(Do you see us? Oh Lord)? Oh Lord?"
"Do you see us down here, oh Lord (oh Lord)? Oh Lord?"
"Do you see us down here, oh Lord (oh Lord, oh)? Oh Lord?"
"Do you see us down here, oh Lord (oh Lord, oh)? Oh Lord?"

Do you see us down here, oh Lord?
Can you see us down here, oh Lord?
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Can you see us?
Can't you see us?
When did I become so numb?
When did I lose myself?
All the words that leave my tongue
Feel like they came from someone else

I'm paralyzed, where are my feelings?
I no longer feel things, I know I should
I'm paralyzed, where is the real me?
I'm lost and it kills me inside, I'm paralyzed

When did I become so cold?
When did I become ashamed? (ohh)
Where's the person that I know?
They must have left, they must have left, with all my faith

I'm paralyzed, where are my feelings?
I no longer feel things, I know I should
I'm paralyzed, where is the real me?
I'm lost and it kills me inside, I'm paralyzed

I'm paralyzed
I'm scared to live, but I'm scared to die
And if life is pain, then I buried mine
A long time ago, but it's still alive
And it's taking over me—where am I?
I wanna feel something, I'm numb inside
But I don't feel nothing, I wonder why
I'm on the race of life and time passes by
Look, I sit back and I watch it
Hands in my pockets
Waves come crashing over me, but I just watch 'em
I just watch 'em
I'm under water but I feel like I'm on top of it
I'm at the bottom and I don't know what the problem is
I'm in a box, but I'm the one who locked me in
Suffocatin', and I'm running out of oxygen

I'm paralyzed, where are my feelings?
I no longer feel things, I know I should
I'm paralyzed, where is the real me?
I'm lost and it kills me inside, I'm paralyzed

I'm paralyzed (I'm just so paralyzed)
Where are my feelings? (Yeah, I'm just so paralyzed)
I no longer feel things (I have no feelings)
I know I should (Oh, how come I'm not moving? Why aren't I moving? Ay yeah)
I'm paralyzed
Where is the real me? (Where is the real me? Where is the real me?)
I'm lost and it kills me - inside (I'm paralyzed, I'm paralyzed)
I'm paralyzed (I'm paralyzed)
Call me at 3 a.m., tellin' me that I could be the one, oh, yeah
Maybe I was in love from the outside, guess I ain't what you want no more
If you got someone else inside of your life, yeah, that's good for you, I'm happy
You got someone that makes you smile more than I ever did, yeah, that's great

Listen, why they always tryna hurt me?
Why they always tryna burn me?
I swear to God, shoulda never even happened in the first place
Only time you hit me's on my birthday
Wish that I could tell you that I got a lot of love for you
Wish that I could tell you I got trust for you
Once you put some money in the bank you understand that the money ain't enough for you
Yeah, look what it's done to you
Everyone's your friend when the music start buzzin'
I'm closer to the people that were there when I was nothin'
Tryna talk about the past but you always changin' subject
I ain't good at shakin' hands but I'm good at holdin' grudges
Why you always frontin', huh? Always tryna play wit' me (woo)
Yeah, whatchu gotta say to me?
I am not a slave to the people writin' checks to me
This is destiny, they ain't never had respect for me, ah!

Call me at 3 a.m., tellin' me that I could be the one, oh, yeah
Maybe I was in love from the outside, guess I ain't what you want no more
If you got someone else inside of your life, yeah, that's good for you, I'm happy
You got someone that makes you smile more than I ever did, yeah, that's great

I don't like that!
I don't like that, no! (I'm really sorry)
I don't like that!
Why you actin' shady on me?
Why you always tryna-
Why you always tryna play, I ain't got a clue right now
Everything I ever wanted was someone, I'm watching them go

Yeah, you said I'm scared for you
Lemme say a prayer for you
Hope you never make it to the top just to find out there ain't nothing there for you
And now the people tryna tell you that they care for you, never cared for you
First time that you ever told me that you loved me, I know that was probably weird for you
'Cause I didn't say it back, I'm so caught up in the past, and I know I wasn't fair to you, woo!
Maybe I don't see the world like I'm s'posed to
Maybe I'm just living in a nightmare
Maybe all the people that I thought that I was close to
Wouldn't be around if it wasn't for my career
Yeah, this third record doesn't pop off, how many people 'bout to drop off?
I know how it works, if the record doesn't work, then it's my fault
I'm in a room full of fans singin' my thoughts, my God, woo!

Call me at 3 a.m., tellin' me that I could be the one, oh, yeah
Maybe I was in love from the outside, guess I ain't what you want no more
If you got someone else inside of your life, yeah, that's good for you, I'm happy
You got someone that makes you smile more than I ever did, yeah, that's great

I don't like that!
I don't like that, no! (I'm really sorry)
I don't like that!
Why you actin' shady on me?
Why you always tryna-
Why you always tryna play, I ain't gotta clue right now
Everything I ever wanted was someone, I'm watching them go

Yeah, yeah, I'm done with that
Reminiscing 'bout all we had
We got nowhere to go, you got all the things you wanted
Got everything that you wanted
Yeah
Oh yeah (oh yeah!)
Just let me work, no, just let me work, no
I'm out here grindin'
Yeah, I'm out here grindin' (woo!)
I told 'em (oh yeah!) that I'm out here grindin'
I'm out here gri—(hey, hey!)

You ain't never heard nothin' like this
Let me work, show me where the mic is
I'm on stage, black shirt, in my Timbs
You know how I do it, I ain't playin' with you, I've been grindin' Anybody tryna sleep on me better do somethin' with your eyelids
I hear a lot of whinin', but I don’t hear a lot of rhymin', woo!
Everybody got opinions, let it go into my ear and then I block that
Put me on stage, I'ma rock that
Sayin' you the best? Stop that
Phony, I am not that, yeah
What are y'all doin' out here? What are y'all doin' out here?
Maybe you should spend a little less time with the women on your arms and a little bit more with your career
I ain't saying I'm the best, but I should be in the top ten; give me a list of names, I'ma top them
I'm just playing with ya, I don't care where the top is
Leave me at the bottom, let me work for it
You ain't never gonna find another rapper in the game and tell me that he works more
Tell me that he works more, nah!
You might see me with my hoodie up, I ain't leaving 'til I finish
This industry ain't nothing but a box, but I ain't gon' climb in it
You put me inside a room full of rappers, come back in five minutes
I'ma be the only one still alive, with a note on my chest saying that I did it!
You do it for fame, we are way different
Y'all are looking weak, we ain't cooking in the same kitchen
Everybody got a shirt with a stain in it
Some of us'll never wear it out though, lemme get it!
I guess I don't understand
This wasn't part of my plan
Some of these people, they're thinking 'cause they heard the name that they really know who I am
Bring the beat down!
I got no time for these Hollywood people, I'd rather give time to my fans
You'd rather chill with these women that like you for money
But I'd rather chill with my fam, yeah
I'm out here grindin'
I'm out here grindin'
Yeah, I see the mic but you looking like a pilot
What's the point of a plane if you don't know how to fly it?
Yeah!

I'm out here grindin', okay okay okay
I'm out here grindin', okay okay okay
I'm out here grindin', okay okay okay
I'm out here grindin', all I do is work, all I do is work

Rise of the underdog, I don't like none of y'all
I'm not like one of y'all
I'm from the jungle, I run with the son of God
Yeah, what is you running for?
They should be running from me
Most of my family, we don't even speak
I'm getting married in 22 weeks
And they still haven't said "Hi" or wanted to meet, huh?
I'm not the type to complain
If we don't get it, we try it again
And I'd die for the gang, Misfit my blood
They don't like us and we question they mom like
"Why did—why did you allow your kid to like bad music?"
Woo! Promise I do it (woo!)
I'm tryna give you my everything
I don't care what they are doing
I'm tryna do what they couldn't do
Laugh at the rappers you look up to
Don't waste time with the centerfolds (ay!)
I'm alive, it's a miracle (ooh)
Freestylin' since middle school (woo!)
I will battle the principal (woo!)
Wear all black like a funeral
I'm doing me, I don't live for you (ayy!)
Grindin'!

I'm out here grindin', okay okay okay
I'm out here grindin', okay okay okay
I'm out here grindin', okay okay okay

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
I'm out here, I'm out here grindin'
All I, all I, all I do is work
All I, all I, all I do is grind (woo!)
Yeah
I wanna know, I wanna know
I wanna know, I wanna know

Been sick with the pen since I was ten inches tall
I'm relentless, you guessed it, back with the vengeance
In the set list, every sentence so raw you can sense it
No question, tryna be the best that
Ever walked this earth, if I'm not, then I'm next up
Dressed up like I'm 'bout to hit a bank or somethin'
Yeah, I am not the one you wanna mess with, no!
When I come into the room, put your heads down
I'm a little bit TØP, Stressed Out
What does that mean?
I'm a rap fiend with a bad lead
You could run if you want, but you'll never catch me
So cold with it, y'all don't get it
Let you put me in a cage just so I can open it
Handcuffed, hands up, this is dope to me
Oh, you thought you had me captured? So funny
Better run from me, I don't think you really understand what this does for me
I dress bummy, but I clean up nice, they ain't never seen this side of me
Long T-shirt, they eyein' me
Rules don't apply to me
You better give me my privacy
I got the fans I got because I'm takin' them behind the scenes
You played hide-and-seek, I played hide-from-me, agh!
Yeah, look at all that we accomplished
Quittin' for me's not an option
I wanna look at my kids in the face when I'm older and say I did something admirable
Fast checks, fast women, that don't inspire me, no!
You don't wanna know what's goin' on inside my personal life? Then get out my diary, yeah

I wanna know what it's like to be happy
I wanna know what it's like to wake up in the morning and feel like it's real when I'm laughin' (yeah!)
I wanna know what it's like to sit down with my friends and feel like they might understand me (woo!)
I wanna know that the people around me care less about Grammys and more about family

I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know (Yeah, yeah!)
I wanna know, I wanna know
I wanna know, I wanna know (Yeah, I wanna know)
I wanna know, I wanna know

Yeah, record labels' signin' artists, they ain't got a clue what to do with
Why would I put my career in the hands of someone that don't even know what they doin'?
Why would I sit in a room full of people that don't even care about me or my future and tell me they ain't really feelin' the vision, then hop on the wagon the moment it's movin', huh?
Heard you tellin' people you don't really like the content
Whatchu wanna hear me rap about?
How I'm on the road gettin' side chicks?
You should treat your mouth like your phone in a movie theater, put that on silence
I don't care what everybody else is doin', I'm just bein' me and that's not how I live
Oh my, oh my, yeah, I'm in the zone now
Zoned out, come to my show with they phones out
Whole crowd, oh wow, that's wild, tone down, no!
I have created my own style
I have created my own sound
Oh, you didn't know? Well, you know it now
Slowin' down
Livin' happy, this is what I was made for
They say you get what you paid for
Grandpa told me, "Always look to Heaven, try to pay attention when you talkin' to God," yeah
I wish I'da paid more, I shoulda prayed more
Everybody's out here shoppin' tryna find a different product in the same stores
Everybody wants they dream to fall in they lap, but don't wanna work for it
I've been doin' this since I was just a kid and mama bought me 8 Mile at the movie store
Hopin' someday maybe I could do what I love for a livin' with people I care for
People that care more about me as person than money I make for 'em, yeah!

I wanna know what it's like to be happy
I wanna know what it's like to wake up in the morning and feel like it's real when I'm laughin' (yeah!)
I wanna know what it's like to sit down with my friends and feel like they might understand me (woo!)
I wanna know that the people around me care less about Grammys and more about family

I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know (Woo! Yo!)
I wanna know, I wanna know (Yeah, I wanna know)
I wanna know, I wanna know
I wanna know, I wanna know (Woo!)

I wanna know, I wanna know (Woo! Yeah!)
I wanna know, I wanna know (Yeah, I wanna know)
I wanna know, I wanna know (Yeah, I wanna know)
I wanna know, I wanna know
Oh these hands are tired
Oh this heart is tired
Oh this soul is tired
But I'll keep on
I'll keep on
I'll keep on
I'll keep on
I'll keep on
I'll keep on

Faith is something I am not accustomed to
And trusting other people's something I don't really love to do
I've never been a fan of it, I act tougher
Really my shoulders they ain't built for this and I don't have nothing
It's like I'm standing in the rain and you offer me a raincoat
But I would rather stand there and get wet than take the handout
What's wrong with me? You said you've always got your hands out
And I cannot continue on my own, so take my hands now
I give you everything, God, not just a little bit
Take it from me, I am nothing but a hypocrite
I hate sin, but I built a house and I still live in it
Afraid to open up the door to You and let You into it
My soul is lost and what it needs is Your direction
I know, I've told You I do not need Your protection
But I lied to You, this thing is tiring
And man was not created for it, God
Please retire me now

Oh these hands are tired
Oh this heart is tired
Oh this soul is tired
But I'll keep on
I'll keep on
I'll keep on
I'll keep on
I'll keep on
I'll keep on

Trust is something I am not accustomed to
And I know the Bible says I should always trust in You
But, I don't never read that book enough
And when I have a question I don't take the time to look it up
Or pick it up
It collects dust on my nightstand
I'm just being honest
Please take this outta my hands
I have no control - I am just a person
But thank the Lord that I serve a God that's perfect
I do not deserve the opportunity You've given me
I never knew what freedom was until I learned what prison means
I am not ashamed, I don't care if they remember me
My life will always have a hole, if You are not the centerpiece
Take me out of bondage, take all of my pride
If I don't have a Savior, I don't have nothing inside
Take all of my lust, take all of my lies
There's no better feeling than when I look in the sky, in Your eyes
It's amazing

Oh these hands are tired
Oh this heart is tired
Oh this soul is tired
But I'll keep on
I'll keep on
I'll keep on
I'll keep on
I'll keep on
I'll keep on

Woaahh
Woah woah woah
Woaahh
Woah woah woah
Woaah
Woah woah woah
I'll keep on
I'll keep on
I'll keep on
Woaahh
Woah woah woah
Woaahh
Woah woah woah
Woaah
Woah woah woah
I'll keep on
I'll keep on
I'll keep on

Woaahh
Woah woah woah
Woaah
Woah woah woah
I'll keep on

I'll keep on
I'll keep on
I'll keep on

I grew up in a small place, had to drive an hour just to see a movie
I'm a simple person, city life just doesn't move me
I'd rather be home with my grandparents and playing Euchre
Didn't wanna leave but this dream's calling, I had to do it
I left my girl there, wish I would've done it different
She was right when she told me that I don't ever listen
I told her I would change a million times and never did it
Apologies don't mean a thing if you don't ever fix it
I love what I do but it's not what I expected
This industry is not your friend, well that's my perspective
Sometimes the closest people to you make you feel protected
But those are the same people that hurt you most and leave you guessing
Some people say nobody's perfect but expect perfection
How you supposed to find the answer if you don't ask the question?
Sometimes I look into the mirror and talk to my reflection
When I go home and turn the music off, what am I left with?

Breathe
Breathe

We used to be close but as time passed, we became disconnected
You never felt love and I always felt disrespected
Your family thought I was a joke, I was always defensive
They just wanted what was best for you, I just couldn't accept it
And hurting you was not a part of my plan or my intentions
But I was immature, I guess I had to learn some lessons
We grew apart and our lives went in different directions
And there's a lot of responsibilities that I neglected
I had a lot that was bottled inside, couldn't express it
And this pain won't leave, I can feel the depression
It's taking over my body, feels like I'm always stressing
Doctor told me I should sleep, but I'm always restless
I lay awake at night and think, my thoughts are relentless
I need a moment to breathe, I need a moment to vent this
I seem to be the only person that I play pretend with
And when I turn the music off, what am I really left with huh?

Breathe
Breathe
I talk to God like, "What's next for me?"
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny (destiny)
Fulfillin' my destiny, yeah
I talk to God like, "What's next for me?"
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny (destiny)
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny, yeah!

I told y'all I'm a psycho
Ain't no tellin' what I might do, yeah
Doubt put his hands around my throat, so I cut 'em off
That's what you get for steppin' on my toes
At the top of the key, that's an iso
My career about to take off, flight mode
You don't like where we're headed, what you sittin' on my flight for, huh?
Yeah, they said, "Wait until your time comes"
Nope! Time's up
You put in the album, got you thinkin' it's your birthday, woo!
Yeah, I'm full of surprises
A lot of pressure on the records, so you know I'm makin' diamonds
Tell me, how would you define this?
You witnessin' the finest
Yeah, you never know what you can do until you try it, ah!
I been workin' late nights like I'm Letterman
He ain't workin' anymore? Well forget it then
Somebody get the sedatives
Too late, yeah the lightbulb's off in my head again
Where is Edison for my adrenaline?
Rushin' through my veins like it's never did
What good is the body, man, if you ain't got the head with it?
Since a kid up I've been a pessimist
I like to focus on the negatives, oh Lord!

I talk to God like, "What's next for me?"
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny (all day!)
Yeah, my pops told me he was proud, I don't think he knew what that meant to me
Yeah, you try to take advantage of me before you die, you'll be dead to me (all day!)
Before you die, you'll be dead to me
Laugh when they question me, y'all ain't no threat to me, yeah

I'm just fulfillin' my destiny
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny (all day!)
To the death of me, I'm just fulfillin' my destiny
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny (all day!)
To the death of me, I'm just fulfillin' my destiny

Yeah, you know I keep it real honest
Real topics, ain't no way I will stop it
Chills watching everything that's going on around me, they wonder if I still got it
I'm still rhymin', just another day in paradise, Phil Collins
'Til you put your hands on me, yeah, now we got a real problem
Pay homage, make comments
We in the same genre, but I can guarantee we don't put out the same product
Get away from me, there ain't nothing you can say to me
Tried to roll my name through the dirt, that's fine, I was made from it
You ain't made it to them printin' shirts with your face on it
Outside tryna sell 'em at your shows, those are fake, dummy
This is something can't nobody ever take from me
No mistakin' me, take a blade to me, take a vein from me
Let me know what you get when you pull the DNA from me, woo!
No matches, I've been the baddest, no way to match it
You never seen the passion that's even half this
I'm wreakin' havoc
I think the fact that you think I'm average is kinda madness
So quit your naggin', you couldn't fathom what I've imagined
Forget the mansion, I'm in the attic
It's pretty graphic, but had to happen
You won't see it, get your glasses, forget the status

Yeah, I feel like we might be on the come-up (all day!)
Knew I was a problem how I showed up (ayy!)
Did not have to sell out, but the show does (all day!)
They ask me why I do it, so I told 'em (yeah!)

I'm just fulfillin' my destiny
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny (all day!)
To the death of me, I'm just fulfillin' my destiny
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny (all day!)
To the death of me, I'm just fulfillin' my destiny

I'm just fulfillin' my destiny
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny (all day!)
To the death of me, I'm just fulfillin' my destiny
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny (all day!)
To the death of me, I'm just fulfillin' my destiny
Yeah
Something for the fans
Yeah

I'm the type to rent a hotel room just to feel at home
I'm the type to rent a hotel room just to be alone (yeah)
I got an issue with people pretending they like what they don't
Please don't bring up my issues unless you gon' deal with your own
Please don't try to pretend like you keep it real, though
Yeah it's funny that you got a lotta money
But that money doesn't buy you skills, though
I don't care if I am on the billboards
On a killing spree, I'm about to kill more
Got a chain on you paid a mill' for
I mean what you people even live for?
I write raps, you steal yours, oh Lord (haha)
We just getting warmed up
Yeah, I said I was coming, I warned you
So close to the fans
I feel like they ride on my tour bus
You wanna know what I do in my downtime?
They come to my fortress
I apologize for all the corpses
It's a mess right now
But I haven't had time to put the rappers in the coffins
We ain't talked in like six years
Why you writing me now?
I just turned 100k down
Just to keep the brand looking right, now (that's real)
I ain't bragging about the money
I'm just saying I ain't controlled by the bank account
Or the bank amounts
I'm a business man
But don't touch my money
I don't play around, woo!
Lights out when the mic's out
About to hit the West Coast
Hype crowds
I just put a record out
What you think I'm gonna pipe down?
Nah, I've been looking for a beat
Look what I found, woo!
I mean everything is coming out of my mouth
Tried to tell me, yeah, I ain't had the right sound
Oh yeah? Well
Tell me what you think now
Two records in the bag, I ain't done though
What's coming next year?
Let me hear the drum roll
Don't flow
Anybody wanna be the one to make an issue out of nothing?
Imma hit you with my iPhone
I know
I'm a little out of hand now
I ain't looking for a handout
You ain't like what I was doing last year
Which is funny 'cause you lookin' like a fan now
Are you a fan now?
I kinda miss being broke
Now let me go back to my old days
When I used to walk into high school
And hand out my CD in hallways
I told all my teachers that I'd be a rapper
They smiled and looked at me, "Okay, that's a pretty nice dream, but you better get a real job."
Mmm, no way
Yeah, I live what you dreamin'
I could do this while I'm sleepin'
I ain't the type that will bring up your name for nothing
But please, don't give me a reason
I'm on the edge now, I ain't playin' with you
Never really been a fan of takin' pictures
I'm just being honest, yeah, I'll take it with you
Shows sellin' out, better get your tickets, oh Lord!
I got a love for the fans
I can't express what it feels like
Sometimes I wonder if it's even real life
Sometimes I look at the past and think about how I got here in the first place
You know the glove is my birthplace
I don't wanna be rude
But I could get you on my worst days
Say nothing for me
Do it all the time
Yeah they barely workin' while I'm workin' overtime
Last year they like, "Who am I?"
Now this year they like, "You the guy."
Here's a little something for your car rides
If they said I fell off, they all lied
Yeah, you know the logo
Better recognize
Yeah it's Real Music 'til the day we die
Yah!
Wait, wait, wait
Don't leave me
Wait, wait, wait
Don't leave me
Where you going?
Where you going?
Why you leaving?
(Wait)
I can't lose you, I can't lose you
Girl I need You
Girl I need You
(Wait)
And don't you love me? Don't you love me?
Guess you don't want me, you don't want me
(Wait)
We back and forth, yeah, this ain't working, this ain't working
Love ain't perfect, love ain't perfect

I'm holding on to pieces of us
That I just can't let go
I know this is a desperate kind of love
But it feels like it's home
Where you going? (Where you going?)
I'm holding on to pieces of us
Cause I just can't let go

Wait, wait, wait
Don't leave me
Wait, wait (wait)
What you thinking? What you thinking?
Where's your mind at?
(Wait)
Don't you miss us, don't you miss us
Cause you don't call back, you don't call back
(Wait)
Are you happy? Tell me are you happy?
Are you smiling? Are you smiling?
(Wait)
Girl what happened? Tell me, girl what happened?
Cause I am dying, I am dying

I'm holding on to pieces of us
That I just can't let go
I know this is a desperate kind of love
But it feels like it's home
Where you going? (Where you going?)
I'm holding on to pieces of us
Cause I just can't let go

We don't wanna have a conversation
We dont wanna think about it, we wanna just fake it
We just wanna act like everything is great
Go back to the day watchin' movies in the basement
And the problem is now I'm feeling like everything is changed
And I'm trying to make a livin' on the music
But I feel like every time I look at you I'm in a place
It's hard to be the man of the house when you ain't gotta house (I hate this)
It's complicated, it's complicated
We don't wanna talk, it's complicated
I'm sitting in the hotel room like, "Why?"
Call your phone and apologize
There's gotta be a way we can make this right
We can make this right

I'm holding on to pieces of us
That I just can't let go
I know this is a desperate kind of love
But it feels like it's home
Where you going? (Where you going?)
I'm holding on to pieces of us
Cause I just can't let go

I'm holding on to pieces of us
That I just can't let go
I know this is a desperate kind of love
But it feels like it's home
Wait, wait, wait
Don't leave me
Wait, wait, wait
Don't leave me
You and I, we've been through a lot together
And I look back and I just uh, I appreciate all the times that we had together, you know?
I remember just going down in my room and
You know dealing'... trying to deal with some things
And you have always been there for that
Always, just me and you

You and I've been best friends, ever since I was a young kid
Everything we did, where has time went?
Got a lot of years coming up ahead of us
And ever since we met
I knew we'd get somewhere
But the fact is I ain't really, I ain't really know when
I don't really know how either, but I can feel the goose bumps, my skin writing
Now I've been waiting for the moment
You and I can make it happen
Lot of people think we ain't gonna make it rapping
I ain't got a problem with em though, they don't even matter
We ain't looking for the people tryna say that we the baddest
No I never liked that, came a long way, never did it for the money
We ever make it big, I'ma give it to the family
Looking back now everything is looking funny
You and I in the room writing, up late when the mood strikes us
We don't care if they do like us
Writing songs for the haters we ain't even got yet
Freestyling? Somebody turn the mic up
Talking bout things we don't really understand
Talking bout things we don't really comprehend
Me and you tryna get it, we ain't quitting till the end
Now I'm standing on stage tryna give it to the fans, yah!

We took that karaoke machine from my room
And uh, we put it up to my CD player and played the instrumentals
Man... We've come a long way
A long way

I made a lot of mistakes
You've been there for the whole thing
Help me with the drama
Rapping in the car outside daily
We don’t care if it’s the winter
We don’t care if its the summer
I remember writing raps with the curse words
I just wanna hear it, seems like everybody does it
Did it for awhile wasn't into all the cussin'
Tried to find who I was
Being everything I wasn't
Real life, yeah!
Gotta lot of anger
You know where I'm at, put it all over the pages
And wrote it into raps, said that we could be amazing, if I give us a chance
Now I'm lookin round like yeah, look at where we at
Look at where we at now, we ain't made it yet but they can hear us in the background comin'
Some are gonna hate it, some are gonna love it
I'ma put it in his hands and let God do the judging, yeah
Remember me and you always had you in the backpack
Took you into school writing on you like its nuthin' a lot of people in the room
See me scribble on a page but they ain't got a clue, nah they ain't got a clue
We're at the beginning hoping someday you and I can say
We made it and we did it
You ain't nuthin but a notepad to me, who you kiddin?
I'm just runnin out of space I'll be back in a minute
Turn the page homie

You know what’s crazy is
This just started as something that was an escape for us
You know?
And now I look around and, there’s a lot of people going through the same things, you know, we've been through
Now this music we write is actually making an impact, it’s crazy
(Oh, ohhh ohhh....)

NF Real Music
I'm boss with it, authentic, all y'all frauds better
Quit with the trash talk before you get tossed in it
Y'all tripping, bar ripping, y'all sipping too much, write 'till the palms dripping
Lost in it, thoughts different, you don't want no drama? Then don't get involved in it
I'm in a whole different head space, you making money? Well that's great
I got no interest in talking to people that I know are two-faced, too fake, get outta my face, woo!
What are you doing in my lane? There's already too many rappers
I'm sick of the traffic and I ain't got no brakes
I already passed you, you don’t like what I’m doing, who asked you?
You got into music 'cause you think it’s fun, man I’m doing this 'cause I have to
It’s real music, chills to it, feel through it, real stupid
Skills truest, quit moving, woo!
If I say something, I will do it, yeah
I used to dream of these moments
I'm living 'em now
Look up to heaven like, "Mom, are you proud?"
I'm on the way to New Zealand, I'm up in the clouds, dang
I mean who woulda known this, who woulda known this
This industry never told me I was welcome
I went to the house with a bat and I broke in
Then told 'em that I would be back
I flatline, all of your whack rhymes, that's mine
Might get away from it, boy, MM LP—I'm the bad guy, last time
I have been taking it easy, the game's mine, fame why?
I don't care about none of that, I'm just sick of the trash lines
I grew up on Eminem, now look where the game's at
Lame raps, Hollywood fame acts, I'm sick of the same trash
I got no blunt in my mouth but give me a beat, I'ma blaze that, woo!
Give me a beat, I'ma blaze that, you and me ain't in the same class
You and me ain't on the same row, music has always been my home
I used to call up some people that won't call me back, now they blowing up my phone, woo!
Ain't it funny how that works? Mad perks, killing the record
Got blood on my black shirt, I'm jealous in love with the music, don't ever come near her!
I ain't from around here, how you let me run it down here?
If that isn't bothering none of you rappers then what are y'all doing out here?
That was like music to my ears, might never make it, I don't care
Drake, I love what you doing, but call up the game and tell 'em that I'm here, yeah!
I like that, might snap, I laugh, y'all better surrender and get out your white flags
And cancel your flight plans, your career isn't taking off
You sound like a hype man hit you with the mic stand
And they ask what the hype's about, come and find out, I mean, where is you clowns at?
I been training, pen game is insane, I'm done playing
This music is ground breaking, lung shaking, done waiting
Y'all taking my patience, quit faking, y'all hating, it's crazy!
I mean, you know what my name is, Rhyme Slayer, stop Nathan, woo!
It feels like a tear in my heart
Like a part of me missing
And I just can't feel it
I've tried and I've tried
And I've tried

Tears on my face I can't take it
If lonely is a taste then it's all that I'm tasting
Do you hear my cry?
I cry, oh

Can you hold me?
Can you hold me?
Can you hold me in your arms?

Just wrap me in your arms, in your arms
I don't wanna be nowhere else
Take me from the dark, from the dark
I ain't gonna make it myself
Put your arms around me
Put your arms around me
Let your love surround me
I am lost
I am lost

If I ain't got you here
If I ain't got you, I ain't got nothing at all

Can you hold me?
Can you hold me?
Can you hold me in your arms?
In your arms

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, I feel like it's just me, like it's just me
What it gon' take? What it gon' be?
I don't even know
(It's not just you)
But I'm lonely
Feeling like I don't even know me, I don't even know me
(I feel it too)
Gotta have you, gotta see you
(You're the only thing I have to think about
The only one I that can't live without)
I see you
(I need you, need you to hold me now)



If I ain't got you
If I ain't got you
I ain't got nothing
I ain't got nothing
If I ain't got you
I ain't got you
If I ain't got you
I'm lonely
If I ain't with you I'm lonely
I'm lonely
I need you
I need you
Can you hold me?


Can you hold me?

Can you hold me in your arms?

Can you hold me?
Can you hold me?
Can you hold me in your arms?



Feel like it's just me, like it's just me
What it gon' take? What it gon' be?
I don't even know, I don't even know
But I'm lonely, lonely
Feel like I don't even know me
Feels like I don't even know me
I don't even know me
Can you hold me?


Can you hold me?
Can you hold me in your arms?
This thing called love can be so cold
It can be miserable, or it can be beautiful
This thing called love can be so cold
Sometimes it's amazing, sometimes it's crazy
This thing called love

Check, check, ayy, listen!
Yo, love is like a drug that everybody uses
You wanna know the outcome—depends on how you use it
Love could be your best friend, love could be your enemy
Love could be the thing you wish you had, but you don't ever see
And love can be the reason why you're afraid to have it
Some say it like it means something, others it's a habit
And some would say it's tragic, and some would say it's beautiful
Some would say it's black and it's dark like a funeral
And some would die for it, some don't think it's even real
Some say they understand, but really don't know how it feels
Some say that it's alive, some say that it can kill
But most of us that been in it know that sometimes it will
I ain't gonna sugarcoat it, yet sometimes it might surround you
One minute it's savin' you, next it's tryin' to drown you
Some people want to show it, but were never taught how to
And some of us is searchin', feelin' like it never found you

This thing called love can be so cold
It can be miserable, or it can be beautiful
This thing called love can be so cold
Sometimes it's amazing, sometimes it's crazy
This thing called love

Yo, love is like a privilege, a lot of us abuse it
Do with it what we want and then start drama when we lose it
Pretend like it ain't nothing to us, pretend that it's useless
And we don't know why we do this, but yet we still pursue it
And love, it can consume you, turn you into something else
Bury the real you so deep that you can't even find yourself
Love, it can change you, love, it can tear you down
Be the best thing you ever had and kick you on the ground
Yo, you get on that high level, yet you scared to fall
'Cause you know if that person hurts you, you gon' lose it all
They told you they would be there for you, they don't even call
So that openness you used to have has now become a wall
And some say that it's patient, some say that it's kind
I don't think it's invisible, but I know that it's blind
To some it's only physical, or all up in their mind
See, it probably isn't there if you're strugglin' to find it

This thing called love can be so cold
It can be miserable, or it can be beautiful
This thing called love can be so cold
Sometimes it's amazing, sometimes it's crazy
This thing called love

This love has got me down low, now I guess I'm up high
One minute I'm on the ground, next minute I'm in the sky
I feel invincible, and so unrejected
Forget it, I'm invisible, and I feel unprotected
Yo, I don't need nobody else, trust me, I'm fine
I can't do this by myself, I'm losing my mind
Yeah, I can see clearly, forget it, I'm blind
My heart says, "danger," can't you read the signs?
Yo, but through all the pain, I swear I love it
No matter what you do, it don't disappear, does it?
Yo, I'd rather spend a minute with love in my life
Than go a million years without knowing what it's like
You better grab it, you don't wanna lose it
And yeah, it brings pain, it's insane, but the bruises
My God can take that all away, you'll find that right person
And everything you thought that wasn't becomes worth it

This thing called love can be so cold
It can be miserable, or it can be beautiful
This thing called love can be so cold
Sometimes it's amazing, sometimes it's crazy
This thing called love
Yeah
Hey, I'm on a hundred right now
Yeah

They say the flow is soundin' like a mixtape
They ain't see it comin' like a fast break
They ain't see it comin' like Jordan hittin' jumpers, yeah, they ask me
"When that new music 'bout to drop?"
Ain't that what I gave you last week? (Last week!)
Yeah, oh, you done it now
Feels like I'm comin' up, but spit it like I'm underground
Wonder how I come into your city like I run the town
Love the sound
Started on the stage, now we in the crowd, woo!
Yeah, what's with the hype though?
Told me that your record was the greatest, but you lied, though
Told me they consider you a god, yeah, well I don't
Say you never lived until you found something to die for, woo!
Yeah, and that is so true
Forget the haters, remember people you're close to
Now I'm doing things they told me I ain't supposed to
They treat me like a player, that's funny, I'm here to coach you!
Go back to the bench, know where you belong
Say that you've been practicin', well maybe you should do it more
Say that you the boss, yeah? Well, who did you employ?
All these sucky rappers—I don't listen to, I'm so annoyed!

I'm on a hundred!
Yeah, I said I'm on a hundred right now, hey!
We on a hundred!
Yeah, I said we on a hundred right now, oh!
I'm on a hundred!
Yeah, I said I'm on a hundred right now, hey!
We on a hundred!
Yeah, I said we on a hundred right now, oh!

Yeah, you shoulda left this on a high note
Different cities, different time zones
You had me open up for your tour
I leave it lookin' like it's my show
The fans beggin' for the encore, woo!
Yeah, and what you know about
Selling merchandise right out your house?
I got 40 boxes in my living room on the couch
Yeah, me and my girl 'bout to ship them out, oh lord!
Yeah, yeah, I thought I told 'em last record
I'm out here grindin' on a mad level
Always on a hundred, they don't understand the mad hustle
Nah, but that's what happens when the fans love you, I know!
Yeah, I ain't the norm, but I like it though
'Bout to move the family out to Nashville
I'm sleepin' on the floor, got no curtains in the bedroom
Hang up the sheets, yeah, that's the way that I roll!
Yeah, they think the money 'bout to change me
That type of talkin' got me angry, yeah
A lot of people tryna play me
Me and the fan base lookin' like the A-Team, woo
How you tellin' people that we family?
—Hold up—
Yeah, when you ain't even met me
That's the type of thing that may upset me
That's the type of thing that may upset me

I'm on a hundred! (Hundred)
Yeah, I said I'm on a hundred right now, hey!
We on a hundred! (On a hundred!)
Yeah, I said we on a hundred right now, oh!
I'm on a hundred!
Yeah, I said I'm on a hundred right now, hey! (Woo!)
We on a hundred!
Yeah, I said we on a hundred right now, oh!
I'm on a hundred!
Yeah, I said I'm on a hundred right now, hey! (Woo!)
We on a hundred!
Yeah, I said we on a hundred right now, oh!

We on a—we on a hundred right now!
Boy!
Agh!
We gotta talk about things
We gotta do something different
Cause this isn't working, this isn't working
I don't, I don't know if I can do this
Riding 'round in the city, baby
I know you wish you could change me
Why you mad? Girl, why you angry?
Yeah, why you angry?
Back and forth, you love you hate me
Arguing about the same things
I don't, I don't know if I can do this
I don't, I don't know anymore, baby I don't know anymore

I wish you didn't say things, I wish you didn't say things
That you don't mean, that you don't mean
I wish you didn't say things, I wish you didn't say things
That you don't mean, that you don't mean

Yeah, I mean she wants somebody that's working a 9-5
I apologise but those ain't my hours, you ain't never been with a man
Who's working this kinda job, who works for this kind of drive, I wouldn't be with me either
Hold up, yeah I think that's work on the other line, I gotta go, we can argue some another time
Hang up the phone, I regret it right after
This is the chance that I couldn't just pass up
See I signed a deal, you say that I should've asked ya
I guess I was scared to see how you reacted
And maybe I knew I'd be selfish
These are the things I ain't proud of
I'm always the type to get jealous, there's always two sides to the story
And you're not the one that I blame when I tell it, that's real, yeah
You ain't the one, you ain't the one
I mean I should've manned up and that's hard to say as a man
The older I get the more I understand a relationship's more than just holding her hand
I'm sorry, you can blame me, yeah, you can blame me

I wish you didn't say things, I wish you didn't say things
That you don't mean, that you don't mean
I wish you didn't say things, I wish you didn't say things
That you don't mean, that you don't mean

What's going on?
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel something
There's too many things I'm tryna deal with
And I understand that you don't feel this
I said there's too many things I'm tryna deal with
And I understand I'm hurting your feelings
I know you don't feel this, yeah
I'm just expressing the way that I'm feeling
The things that I'm trying to deal with
I guess I've been trying to hold it all inside
But it's obvious that ain't working
Yeah it's obvious that ain't working
The only thing we got in common
Is that we got nothing in common, baby
Baby, I guess I don't understand
How did we let this slip through our hands?
We were so in love, and then we lost it all
And now it's over, now it's over
I know we said that we could just be friends
But I can no longer play pretend
Because the memories of us cloud my head
And I'm sorry, so sorry

But, I have to say goodbye
Yeah, goodbye
I don't wanna say it
Nah, I don't wanna say it
I don't wanna say goodbye
Goodbye
But we have to
But we have to

And baby, I guess I can't comprehend
The fact that this could really be the end
I wish we could talk this out instead
But we've tried that
Haven't we tried that?
I'm doing my best to let this go
'Cause it's obvious that we're on different roads
You consume my mind when I'm alone
And I miss you
Oh, how I miss you

But I have to say goodbye (Why?)
Yeah, goodbye (I don't wanna do it)
Yeah, I don't wanna say it (I don't wanna do it right now)
Nah, I don't wanna say it (Yeah)
Yeah, I dont wanna say goodbye (I don't wanna say goodbye, no)
(Listen) But goodbye
(The fact is) But we have to (We have to)
(Baby) Baby, but we have to (But we have to)
You put your hand into mine, and baby we flew
And whenever you're not around I don't know what to do
And I'd rather die than go on living without you
You're the one for me
You're the one for me

You're the only one, only one
Nothing's gonna hold us up
I got you and after all that we've been through
We've been through some things
But it's okay, okay
There's no way I'm leaving
Baby believe it

I put my hand into yours, and baby I knew
That you would be there no matter what we go through
You're not alone. I'll always be there for you
Cause you're the one for me
You're the one for me

You're the only one, only one
That is gonna hold us up
I got you and after all that we've been through
We've been through some things
But it's okay, okay
There's no way I'm leaving
Baby believe it
You're the only one, only one
That is gonna hold us up
I got you and after all that we've been through
We've been through some things
But it's okay, okay
There's no way I'm leaving
Baby believe it

Girl, I don't want to sound like I'm on repeat
I know that it sounds like it might seem weak
Been through too much, I know it ain't easy
To look at my face, it's difficult when you see this
Hey we been falling apart and we've been trying to fix this
I'm hoping and wishing that things will be different
I don't want to lose you, I know that I miss this
Cause you're the only one on my mind I listen to

Trying to be the man that you need, I need time
And I know that it seems I don't try
But I promise I won't lie, Won't lie
Every time I look in your eyes, Your eyes
Girl, I get this feeling that I never had
And I just want you to understand

You're the only one, only one
That is gonna hold us up
I got you and after all that we've been through
We've been through some things
But it's okay, okay
There's no way I'm leaving
Baby believe it
You're the only one, only one
That is gonna hold us up
I got you and after all that we've been through
We've been through some things
But it's okay, okay
There's no way I'm leaving
Baby believe it

This is all I do, this is all I do, oh

I just put a hundred in the bank
I don't mean a hundred thousand
Haha, yeah, yo, I mean a hundred dollars
They say that I got no humor in music, then why am I smiling?
Why am I smiling, you do not feel it? (woo!)
Why are you lying?
You know somebody that's iller than me?
I wanna meet 'em
I wanna meet 'em, enough with the talking, woo!
I wanna see 'em!
I do not look at these rappers out here like I wanna be 'em
I look at these rappers out here like I wanna beat 'em
I am competitive, always been that way
Always been that way, that'll never change
Fans hit me up on my Instagram, like, "You've been singing too much"
Then the moment I stop you gon' write me and say I ain't singing enough!

I feel like LeBron (yeah!)
I feel like LeBron (they don't know, they don't know)

I have been at this for years, this didn't fall on my lap
I get so personal with you, you feel like you know me
You feel like we met
Fans getting into the music, relating, woo!
Tell me what's doper than that (nothin'!)
How you gon' say you the best in the game when you sound like you don't even know how to rap? (hahaha!)
I used to hand out my demos at shows, like, "Listen to me" (real life)
This ain't what it seems
I never sleep, which is funny, 'cause I'm out here living the dream
You say you livin' the dream, no, you just live in the dream
Y'all need to wake up, and get out of yo beds!
And quit sleepin' on me!
I got my head in the game, you know what that means?
(You know what that means?)
Oh yeah, you know what that means?
They got no clue, they got no clue
I thought I already told you before, this is all that I do, agh!

I feel like LeBron
"I've been, I've been doing this a long time, I mean over half my life. So, it's, it's awesome for me to be able to put out music that people will actually hear. Especially when you put this much time into something that you love, something that you have a passion for. That's motivation!"

I, I'm motivated, motivated
Motivated, motivated
Motivated, motivated
Motivated
I, I'm motivated, motivated
Motivated, motivated
Motivated, motivated
Motivated, I

When I first started, never knew if they will listen
But when I write, I produce passion, that's Mel Gibson
If music is a disease, I promise I'm infected
I dream on different levels of dreams—Inception
And these beats are my playground, let the words play
You ain't catch it? That's wordplay, now you're stuck on the word "play"
I'm all business, no suit on, but that's okay
I will K.O. you, if you come in my work space
And don't you ever try to tell me I lack passion
I'm a stand up guy, I promise you ain't laughing
These rappers are slowin' the game down—bad traffic
And how you gonna put me in a category of wack rappin'?
Yeah, listen, I'm Hulk, I transform and I smash rappers
You sipping on syrup, that doesn't mean you're a sick rapper
See, what it means is you gon' prolly get sick after
You don't like that I'm blunt, or is it the fact that I smoke passion?

Take your best shot
Take your best shot

I ain't going nowhere, nowhere

I put work in this music, you think I'm makin' this up?
If the songs ain't sharp, trust me they ain't makin' the cut
You don't like it? I'm no teacher, but you'll learn to adjust
I'm my own worst critic, so critics step your hate game up
I'm a different breed of artist, I know how to survive
You come into my lane, you better know how to drive
And I suggest you buckle up if you gon' come on this ride
No Johnny Cash, but some of y'all are walking the line
But you wrong though, y'all look curious
Heath Ledger type of questions like, "Why so serious?"
And you want watered down lyrics? Well, I don't carry 'em
I dig holes for these tracks, and then I slaughter and bury 'em
The motivation I got is on a whole different level
I treat these lines like court case, I don't wanna settle
And my lyrics are like bullets, and they're aiming at you
And I ain't talking Switchfoot when I dare you to move

Take your best shot
Take your best shot
Take your best shot
I ain't going nowhere, nowhere

Yo, when it comes to punches, you know I'm a land mine
No, I said I'm a land mine
Don't step on me, or you get blown sky high
And I don't mean secrets when I say to keep it in mind
That I'm ill with the words—too sick
They say I rap hungry, well that's cause I'm star-vin—Diesel
That's why they calling me Riddick-ulous
'Cause the look in my eyes is different

Y'all ain't ready (rewind that back)
Y'all ain't ready (rewind that back)
Y'all ain't ready

Oh yeah

Used to drive a car that ain’t running right
Overheats in the day, so I drive at night
And I know it sounds funny but it’s real life
Yeah, I know it sounds funny but it’s real life
I'm pulled over 'cause I'm dyin' at a red light
I thank God for the hard times
'Cause I guarentee without him I wouldn't be here
Let's be clear
I was given two cars, I ain't really outta money
Tryna rap, makin' $9,000 a year
I don't say it so you feel for me
I say it 'cause it's real to me
I go to my grandma's, hoping she can make a meal for me
Now I got some labels on the tables
Saying that they got a deal for me, ah!

I can feel it, I can feel it
(I can feel it)
I can feel it, I can feel it
(Oh yeah, yeah)
I can feel it, I can feel it

(Yeah)

In Michigan, them winters cold
We wouldn't wanna turn on the heat, keep the bills low
We sitting in the living room in our winter coats
Yeah, we sitting in the living room in our winter coats
Me and my room-mate, we like "they don't know!"
Driving around town in the Grand Prix
People telling me that I should get a Plan B
Snow on the windshield, can't see
Tryna work 6:00 in the morning, that's me!
Sometimes I miss all those memories
They pop up back in my mind like, "remember me"
Records stop selling, these people won't care for me
The older you get, the more family is everything!

I can feel it, I can feel it
(I can feel it)
I can feel it, I can feel it
(I can feel it)
I can feel it, I can feel it
(I said, I can feel it)
I can feel it, I can feel it

(Oh, yeah)
I can feel it, I can feel it
(I said, I can feel it)
I can feel it, yeah!
Yeah, I ain't sleeping lately
I ain't sleeping lately
Yes I know that I'm the only person that can change me
Maybe, that's why I ain't changing
That's why I ain't changing
I got too much on my mind I guess I don't know how to face it
I just don't know how to face it
I don't know how to face it, yeah
Don't know how to face it
I don't know how to face it
Don't know how to face it
I don't know how to face it
I don't know how to face it, how to face it aaah

Don't know how to face it
Let's go back to basics
Yes say what you mean, do what you say, but man I hate this
I just don't know what I'm chasing, don't know what I'm chasing
Yes, somebody told me
Life is something you don't wanna play with
But I just keep on playing like life is just a playground
I go through these mood swings
Watch everything slide down
I look at myself and I ask what the goal is
Yeah tell me what your goal is
I'm just so lost in emotions, I don't even notice
I just slip into a place and I don't think straight
Devil in my ear tryna tell me everything's great
And in a year I realize I'm in the same place
Running in the same race same pace

Yeah, I ain't sleeping lately
I ain't sleeping lately
Yes I know that I'm the only person that can change me
Maybe, that's why I ain't changing
That's why I ain't changing
I got too much on my mind I guess I don't know how to face it
I just don't know how to face it
I don't know how to face it, yeah
Don't know how to face it
I don't know how to face it
Don't know how to face it
I don't know how to face it
I don't know how to face it, how to face it aaah

Don't know how to face it
Let's go back to basics
Think about the words you 'bout to say before you say it
Sin is bittersweet I taste it, bittersweet I taste it
Get that sickness out my mouth
I feel like my train is derailing
I can feel it
Yo these words are only words until they actions
Words until they actions strive on empty satisfactions
Yeah the fact is I don't know, fact is I don't know
Yeah I get on these stages say that I put on a show
But yeah that show it don't mean nothing
If I don't live my lyrics, if they don't feel the spirit in my songs
Then they don't hear it
Homie yeah that don't mean nothing
This ain't all about appearance
Everything starts with the man in the mirror

I ain't sleeping lately
I ain't sleeping lately
Yes I know that I'm the only person that can change me
Maybe, that's why I ain't changing
That's why I ain't changing
I got too much on my mind I guess I don't know how to face it
I just don't know how to face it
I don't know how to face it, yeah
I don't know how to face it
I don't know how to face it
I don't know how to face it, how to face it aaah
Yo, to be honest, I feel completely alone
Like nobody knows me
Nobody understands me
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, it's kinda like this
Check it out

I'm a little bit numb, little bit frozen
A walking emotion, but nobody knows it
Nobody knows me
I'm lost and I'm caught in a cold dream
But they don’t see that I'm walkin' around so boldly
'Cause nobody out there knows these
Thoughts in my mind, am I wastin' my time?
I know, I won’t survive; hold me
'Cause I'm bleedin' to death
I got these holes in my chest
I feel like no one respects the fact that I'm up to my neck
I've done my best, but, still yet it seems like I'm out in the cold
Look at me froze; here on my own
Please, don’t let me die here alone

I cannot face this alone
I can't get by on my own

Lost in the moment
Life in a coma
Lyin' around, see my life getting colder
I'm alone, but I go nowhere
Living in a prison in my mind; so scared
I don't wanna be this way, nah
I don't wanna feel this way, nah
I don't wanna die this way
Why am I this way?
Wish I had wings so I'd fly away
Nothin' around me, up where the clouds be
I'm the real definition of drowning
My pain and my head keeps pounding
How's he even living in the state he's at?
Left the pain, swear I’d never go back
But it's right here, and it's quite clear that it's not leaving
Does anybody hear me?

I cannot face this alone (I need You) (I need You)
I can't get by on my own (I need You) (I need You)
I cannot face this alone (I need You) (I need You)
I can't get by on my own (I need You) (I need You)

I was a little bit numb, little bit frozen
Kinda hard to see when your eyes ain't open
How you gonna breathe when your sin keeps chokin'
You to the point that you feel hopeless?
Hopin' things will turn around
Kinda hard to fly when you layin' on the ground
Jesus is the only reason any of us breathin'
Yeah, so don't get down
You ain't gotta live your life in the cold
Thinkin' nobody out there knows
What you been through, where you been to
Yeah, you ain't gotta live alone
He's Messiah, He's Creator
There ain't no one out there greater
Forget about them haters, accept Christ and make a change-up
Yeah, 'cause you ain't gotta die this way
Let Him wipe them tears right from your face
Life's a dream
So you better get back on track; in other the words, I'm saying:
Give Him your pain, give Him your hurt
Faith is way more than just going to church
Making your money and going to work
You don't give it to God? You'll watch everything burn, yeahh
And this ain't no game
Living without Him is just so insane
People, they livin' for money and fame
Things never change 'cause we living the same
I don't wanna be alone; hate the cold
I'm so broken, I'm so froze
But no longer
'Cause I got my Jesus, and He makes me stronger

I cannot face this alone (I need You, I need You)
I can't get by on my own (I need You, I need You)
I cannot face this alone (I need You, I need You)
I can't get by on my own (I need You, I need You)
Oooh
(I need You)
(I need You)
I need You, oooh, yeah
(I need You)
(I need You)
I can't get by on my own (Yo I can't get by)
I need You (Yo I can't get by)
Ooh, yeah, yeah
I need You (Yo I can't get by)
(I can't get by)
(I need you)
There she goes
She's so beautiful
She's so beautiful, yeah
But she's so broke
She's so incredible
Wonder if she'll ever know

Yeah, Oh she lays in her bedroom
And she cries
Yeah she cries (whoa whoa)
And she feels depressed as
Tears fall from her eyes
From her eyes (whoa whoa)
All she wants is love
But she never finds it in herself (whoa whoa)
And she just feels broken
I can tell that she's hopeless looking for help (whoa whoa)

There she goes
She's so beautiful
She's so beautiful (whoa whoa)
But she's so broke
She's so incredible
I wonder if she'll ever know (whoa whoa)

She gets attention from every direction
But she doesn't care (whoa whoa)
She prays for protection
Scared of rejection
Is anyone there? (whoa whoa)
She used to laugh
But now she's crying
Sick of the pain (whoa whoa)
She puts on her mask
Pretends, and she acts like she's okay (whoa whoa)

And there she goes
She's so beautiful
She's so beautiful (whoa whoa)
But she's so broke
She's so incredible
I wonder if she'll ever know (whoa whoa)

There she goes again putting on that fake act
Hard to see the real her when she got that fake mask
Daddy left it, he ain't never came back
Tears her apart but, she would never say that
She wants love, but don't know where to get it from
It's hard to learn respect from a man that never gave her none
So she cries and she yelling in the mirror
Is anybody out there? Does anybody care?
And people think they know her, but they don't really have a clue
Working three jobs, yeah she's doing what she have to do
Getting stressed out, and boys say she's beautiful
But that don't really mean a thing if she don't believe it though
Insecurity starting to take over
She looking for warmness, but keeps getting colder
Yeah, I know ya tripping on your looks and such
But quit looking to world, and start looking up
God made you beautiful

And there she goes
She's so beautiful
She's so beautiful (whoa whoa)
But she's so broke
She's so incredible
I wonder if she'll ever know (whoa whoa)
Red Bull in my hands, feels like I got wings
Lotta people in my face, but I can't hear a thing
It's like my heads up in the clouds, heads up in the clouds
And I ain't coming down, no
Just turn the music on, just let me get lost
I swear that I'ma lose it if somebody turns it off
What are you out your mind?
You must be out your mind

Just turn the music up, turn the music up
Turn the music up
Turn the music up
Turn the music up

Snap back on my head, I'm so motivated
Nike's on my feet, understand the situation
This is not a game, this is not a game
You ain't gon' bring me down, no
Yeah I mean what I say, and I say what I mean
You best wipe off that hater look before you make me scream
What are you out your mind?
You must be out your mind

Just turn the music, turn the music up
Turn the music up
Turn the music up
Turn the music up
Turn the music up

I got the adrenaline
Rhyme like I’m a veteran
Fine, I’ve been ahead of the
Game, no way I’m settlin'
Drained, but I'ma get it in
Lame this is a medicine
Hey, you get the medic kit cause
Beats, I don’t let ‘em live
Fast, better keep pedalin'
Blast you with the pen again
Laugh, but I’m ahead of them
Act, like I don’t get it then
That is when I enter in
Rap until I never can
Cash, it is irrelevant
Passion is the element
Laps around these other men
Pass ‘em, who you runnin’ with
Facts, is what I’m coming with
Back, but I ain’t never left
Snap, but I will never get
Wack, you better get a grip
Last isn’t a medal it’s glass and I'ma shatter it
Who do you think you battling?
Who do you think you laughing at?
I am not a comedian, man it don’t even matter
If you don’t know what I’m saying, you better do what the chorus says
You don’t know what the chorus says?
Turn it up on the choruses!

Turn the music up
You must be out your mind
Turn the music up
You must be out your mind
Turn the music up
You must be out your mind
Turn the music up
Turn the music up
Turn the music up
You must be out your mind
Turn the music up
You must be out your mind
Turn the music up
You must be out your mind
Turn the music up
Turn the music up
Turn the music
Turn the music
Up
You must be out your mind
You must be
Feels like I'm in the sky
Flying over clouds or somethin'
I don't smoke weed, but you could say I'm high on somethin'
Its like this music is my addiction, I call it my nicotine
What you're witnessing is an addicted fiend and it sickens me (AH)
Just a lame as how you picture me
Give me that microphone and I'm gonna rip it so viciously
Ain't you hearing the chemistry?
Ain't it ironic I brought up chemistry?
Cuz I was never good at math but I'm ill with the melodies

Since I was a kid, I had a dream that I would make it
I spent thousands of hours writing music in that basement
Even though I'm broke, you know why I still chase it?
Cuz once you get a taste of it there is no replacement
Yo, I don't rap, so millions of people will like me
I rap, cuz there's millions of people just like me
If you think I'm out of my mind, I ain't gonna argue, I might be
But I'm not on the stage just for people to sightsee

I'd rather die than let this dream go to waste
You can tell that I ain't playin' by the look up on my face
The world wants to tell us who we are and who we ain't
But the person that I am is somethin' you can never change
Yea I'm just being me, yea
I'm just being me, yea
I'm just being me, yea
And this defines me
Look into my music and you'll find me

When I step into that studio, feels like I'm in my house
If you listen to my music than you know what I'm about
No I ain't never been the type to just sit around on the couch
I get lost in these beats till my body passes out
Let's rewind
What ever happened to music that meant something
Cuz nowadays I look around and music don't mean nothin'
And to be honest what's really making me sick to my stomach
Is everybody's runnin' around screaming they love it

A lotta people think they understand the music biz
I am not a genius but at least I know what music is
Put a CD on the shelf, and you thinkin' you'll be filthy rich
But you just become the definition of what filthy is
The music, me and her, we've been through a lot together
And I can tell somethin' ain't right if we are not together
And yo God gave me the story so we plot together
I get shot, whatever, this is who I am remember?

I'd rather die than let this dream go to waste
You can tell that I ain't playin' by the look up on my face
The world wants to tell us who we are and who we ain't
But the person that I am is somethin' you can never change
Yea I'm just being me (yea)
I'm just being me (yea)
I'm just being me (yea)
And this defines me
Look into my music and you'll find me

I'd rather die than let this dream go to waste
You can tell that I ain't playin' by the look up on my face
The world wants to tell us who we are and who we ain't
But the person that I am is somethin' you can never change
Yea I'm just being me (yea)
I'm just being me (yea)
I said that I'm just being me (yea)
I'm being me, I'm just being me

I'd rather die than let this dream go to waste
You can tell that I ain't playin' by the look up on my face
The world wants to tell us who we are and who we ain't
But the person that I am is somethin' you can never change
Yea I'm just being me (yea)
I'm just being me (yea)
I'm just being me (yea)
And this defines me
Look into my music and you'll find me
Yea I'm just being me

Intro 2 Artwork:
I Just Wanna Know Artwork:
Yeah, I don't know
I guess I feel like—when I'm around you—that I'm invisible
It's like you don't even see me
And I'm standing right in front of you, yeah

Yeah, I feel invisible, I knew this wasn't easy
I'm standing right in front of you, but you don't even see me
I pass you in the hallway, but you don't even glance, so
I just kinda walk by like I ain't never passed you
I do my best to pretend that I don't notice you
'Cause you don't ever notice me, so what am I supposed to do?
What, I gotta yell it in order for you to see it?
Got it written on my face, it's pretty easy to read it
But you choose not to, so that's what I'ma have to do
My heart is getting tired; I'm tired of running after you
I try to talk, but you just keep ignoring me
Pretending that you listen—you don't listen; you're destroying me
See, I look up to you, but you keep looking down on me
You never say you love me or you care or that you're proud of me
In other words, you're drowning me
I get on my knees and I pray
Pretty pathetic, but you make it pretty easy to say

I swear, I must be invisible
'Cause you never see me anymore
And I swear, I must look miserable
'Cause you never hold me anymore

You like a nightmare, every time I'm dreaming
The longest conversation that we had was when we're screaming
"And what you say?" "What you say?" There's nothing else to talk about
Before I even say a word, it's like you're already walking out
You keep making promises, but you don't ever keep 'em
And then look at me stupid when I say I don't believe 'em
Yeah, that's right I don't believe you, and how do you expect me to?
You don't show respect to me, but I should show respect to you?
Gosh, you're such a hypocrite, I doubt you're even listening
Things have got so bad, you don't even pretend you're interested
And every time we hug, which isn't very often
The thing I used to love has now become something that's awkward
You put that smile up on your face, but I can tell you're faking
You look me in the eyes and you tell me I'm amazing
But all your words are wasted, 'cause I swear that you make it up
And I'm so sick of chasing love; I guess my pace ain't quick enough
I hate it, 'cause

I swear, I must be invisible
'Cause you never see me anymore
And I swear, I must look miserable
'Cause you never hold me anymore

I'm full grown now, moved out, I thought it was best
The sad thing is, I doubt you even noticed I left
I quit calling 'cause you ain't ever answer the phone
So the last time we talked, I told you, “Leave me alone”
I'm supposed to open my arms and hold you now?
Hold you? Wow. You ain't never held me; how—
Do you expect a kid that you never raised to do right—
To break the walls down and make you a part of my life?
But hold up, here comes a call from the hospital
They told me I should come and see you if it's possible
I got my shoes to go, I threw my pride on the floor
Saw a real smile on you when I walked in the door
The doc told me you ain't got more than a day
I just got you and this cancer gon' take you away
You say you love me, you can see me, everything's okay
For some reason I no longer feel the urge to say

I swear, I must be invisible
'Cause you never see me anymore
And I swear, I must look miserable
'Cause you never hold me anymore

I swear, I must be invisible
'Cause you never see me anymore
And I swear, I must look miserable
'Cause you never hold me anymore
You call it a hobby, I call it a way of life
No way that you can stop me
You know that I've been trainin', right?
The more you try to block me, the more that I control the fight
And now you on the ropes, now you on the ropes
Whatchu gon' do!?
Quittin's not an option
That voice in your head that keeps telling you "You got this" lied to you
And now everybody's watchin'
You shoulda worked a little harder, 'cause, man, your punches are garbage!
I dream big, ain't that the point of it?
Let's keep it real, huh, ain't that the point of this?
They used to tell me I was nothing, nothing
Now they tell me that I'm something, what's it
Gonna take for you to understand the concept?
I ain't really got no time for all the nonsense
See, to you this is a joke, a little project
I guess you'll never understand this kinda mindset

Started as a dream, grow into reality
Made a lot of sacrifices, that's how it has to be
I give it everything I got, ain't no way you're passin' me
I know we're in the same profession, but you're not a match for me
I'm on another level
I'm on another level
I said I'm another level
On another level
I wish, that I could leave it all behind me
Go to my own world where no one can find me
I guess it's just the way I escape, yeah
I guess it's just the way I escape
And I wish, that I could take parts of my past
Hold on to the good and throw the rest in the trash
I guess it's just the way I escape, yeah
I guess it's just the way I escape

Have you ever been so broke, or frozen, it's so cold
Emotions are so blown, hoping you won't go
Back to that war zone, the place that you don't know
It's hard to go the right way when you're on the wrong road
Feel like you're so low, you're 'bout to explode
And you'd do anything to get back what you let go
Stuck in upset mode, 'cuz you can't seem to figure this out
Living without a reason to live, thinking about
What you should have done, things that you could have changed
And maybe if you had then things wouldn't be this way
And you wouldn't feel this pain, but that's too easy now isn't it
Wishing that you could go back and things would be different
Got a time machine up in your mind
Wishing you could push a button and your life would unwind
But that's not how it happens, you can hope and imagine
Instead of looking forwards, lot of us looking backwards

I wish, that I could leave it all behind me
Go to my own world where no one can find me
I guess it's just the way I escape, yeah
I guess it's just the way I escape
And I wish, that I could take parts of my past
Hold on to the good and throw the rest in the trash
I guess it's just the way I escape, yeah
I guess it's just the way I escape

Have you ever been so lost, you feel like your hope's gone
And know you need to let go of some things but you hold on
Hoping and wishing that some things would be different
So you scream in your room, it feels like nobody's listening
You're mad so you scream louder, things that you're not proud of
Wishing you knew a way to escape but you don't know how the
Heck are you supposed to cope with something you can't let go
You get emotional, wonder if you'll ever know
Came to get lost in it, wishing back lost minutes
Your anger's involved in it, so you get engulfed in this
Pain that you come to hate, wishing you could escape
But you don't know where to run, it's written all on your face
Look at me losing control, I just don't know where to go
I'm getting lost in the mo-ment, look at me woah (Yeah)
I think it's time for me to escape
Time to relate, follow me as I put this pen to this page

I wish, that I could leave it all behind me
Go to my own world where no one can find me
I guess it's just the way I escape, yeah
I guess it's just the way I escape
And I wish, that I could take parts of my past
Hold on to the good and throw the rest in the trash
I guess it's just the way I escape, yeah
I guess it's just the way I escape

I'm so sick of feeling
Like I don't have a clue what I'm doing
Like I don't have a clue what I'm doing
Yeah
And I'm so sick of feeling
Like I don't have a clue where I'm going
Like I don't have a clue where I'm going
Yeah

See all of us need a place, where we can go escape
Get away from the pain, be ourselves and just run away
But where are we running to, this lane we've been running through
Starting to get harder and it's starting to bother you
Some of us get depressed, some of us go to music
Some of us get stressed, others just push through it
So I'm gonna push through this, now and get lost in this
Escape and get lost in it, get ready we've all said it

I wish, that I could leave it all behind me
Go to my own world where no one can find me
I guess it's just the way I escape, yeah
I guess it's just the way I escape
And I wish, that I could take parts of my past
Hold on to the good and throw the rest in the trash
I guess it's just the way I escape, yeah
I guess it's just the way I escape
You say that you love me
Let's talk about it
And you swear that you'll always be there
I doubt it
When I look in those eyes
I can tell you're lying
All those tears that you cry
Why do you keep denying

You say that you care but I know you're lying
Please spare me the tears
There'll be no sympathizing
I act like I'm fine
But you're antagonizing
My heart is falling apart

We lay in my bed, so irritated
All the things that we said
Yeah, it's so frustrating
Who am I to tell you that you're not perfect
It's just that I thought that you were a different person
We smile and pretend like nothing matters
When in fact, in the end, it just makes us madder

You say that you care but I know you're lying
Please spare me the tears
There'll be no sympathizing
I act like I'm fine
But you're antagonizing
My heart is falling apart

I look at you now
Yeah what I used to see
Is breaking me down
Why ain't you like you used to be?
Still beautiful as ever, yet I feel no unity
Usually, I just feel like you're using me
You're telling me you love me, yeah, from the lips of your mouth
But honestly, honesty isn't what I think's coming out
Seems the people you love the most, push you down, let you go
That's why I'm here to let you know, we lie to people just for show
You pretend you care, but really it don't bother you
Wonder if it will when I decide to say goodbye to you
I'm trying to fix it, what you think I'm trying to do?
You don't like my attitude, then wonder why I'm mad at you
I've had enough of it
My heart, you ain't touching it
You say you're in love with it
But really, you're crushing it
I don't hate you, I'm just trying to understand how you feel
There ain't no point of continuing this if it ain't even real

You say that you care but I know you're lying
Please spare me the tears
There'll be no sympathizing
I act like I'm fine
But you're antagonizing
My heart is falling apart

You say that you care
Please spare me the tears
I act like I'm fine
My heart is falling apart
A few words to define my music?
I'd say it's pretty laid-back

Let me see those hands up
Let me see those hands up
Let me see those hands up
Let me see those hands up, hands up

Yo! Yeah, I'm like Ali when I write hooks (yeah), get it? Right hooks
These songs are like the chapters of my life and this is my book
Yo, you seein' me on these stages, go into a song, I'm turnin' these pages
Turn the pages, welcome to chapter one of my life: "crazy"
Yeah, let's call it that if ya'll don't mind, I got a dope mind with these Pope lines
I don't smoke, I'm in a cold climate, so ya'll better hold on
They tellin' me that I'm loco, um, tell me something I don't know
Ain't that a clear picture, no photo, yeah, clear pictures, no photo
And yo this ain't about the photos or the fame life (nah)
I kill my flesh and live for God all in the same life
So call me what you wanna, but I'ma do what I gotta, yup
And anybody got a problem, shh (NF real music)

Let me see those hands up
Let me see those hands up
Let me see those hands up
Let me see those hands up, hands up

And yo, I started from the bottom, no Drake though, yeah I came in the game like, "hello"
I came in the game like, "let's go"
Oh, this beat might break your neck bones
But that's okay, okay
You ain't heard of me, then you so late
So just take a seat of that cold plate
And just let-let-let-let me explain
Yo, "NF" be the logo
"Capitol" be the label
If I see beats on my table
I swear, I'ma eat the whole plateful
And that's my life
I write what I mean so I might
Go a little bit cray when I find mics
I ain't doing it so I am in the limelight, 'cause that limelight, it ain't nothin'
Am I in this for the money? Hey quit crackin' jokes
'Cause we all know this industry is known for cuttin' throats
And if this was all for money, I'd have quit years ago
But it's not, so turn me up until my ears explode, let's go

Let me see those hands up
Let me see those hands up
Let me see those hands up
Let me see those hands up, hands up

Let me see those hands up
Let me see those hands up
Let me see those hands up
Let me see those hands up
Hands up
Oh let me see those hands up
(Where you at?  Where you at?)
Let me see those hands up
(Where you at?  Where you at?)
Let me see those hands up
(Where you at?  Where you at?)
Let me see those hands up
(Where you at?  Where you at?)
Hands up
(W- w- w- w- where you at?)

Let me see those hands up
Let me see those hands up
Let me see those hands up
Let me see those hands up, hands up
Let me see those hands up
Let me see those hands up
Let me see those hands up
Let me see those hands up, hands up
Oh I miss you
Whoa I miss you
Now your gone yeah
Now your gone
(2x)
No

I should have been there told you that I loved ya
Held a little tighter as I kiss, and when I hug ya
I should have called ya, told you that I missed ya
Tears on my face as I'm looking at your pictures
Yeah I'm with ya, but only in this mindset
Since you've been gone you ain't never left my mind yet
And I'm upset, not because of you
I wish all I remember was the good, I never do
I guess when you lose something, thats when you appreciate it
If you were hear, then I'd show you my appreciation
But your not, so I'mma have to learn to cope with it
Got a box of memories, but I'm scared to open it
I see you smiling, but only when I'm dreaming
I know your gone forever, but somehow I don't believe it
Somebody wake me up, my eyes closing
I'm hoping some day you'll be there when they open, but

I never thought I'd have to say goodbye to you so soon
But now you're gone (Now you're gone)
Now you're gone (Now you're gone)
I never thought I'd have to say goodbye but now I do
And I miss you (And I miss you)
Oh I miss you (Oh I miss you)

Yeah, I wish you can hear me
But I know you don't
And I wish you would call me
I know that you won't
But why I gotta cry second dwelling on the negative?
Use what you love, It will take you where you never been
Yo depression, naw far from it
Have I cried? Oh yeah I've done it
If I could I'd change, and I'd go back
Problem is if we could, yeah, we'd all do that
I can see you laughing at my memories
Sad part is that's the only thing I'll ever see
You use to wear a tough face and play pretend
Now, the fact is I'm never going to see you again
See my life just doesn't seem right without ya
I can feel the tears coming when I think about ya
Matter fact I think I feel some now
I'm sick of holding them back
Thats why I'm letting them out

I never thought I'd have to say goodbye to you so soon
But now you're gone (Now you're gone)
Now you're gone (Now you're gone)
I never thought I'd have to say goodbye but now I do
And I miss you (And I miss you)
Oh I miss you (Oh I miss you)

I look in the mirror I can see you in my face
I could care less now about your mistakes
Not cause they don't bother me not cause they ain't bruise me
I just trying to feel like you ain't never knew me
I'm all mixed up lost in the emotion
Loved you so much, too bad I never showed it
But on the upside, there's one thing
You put a smile on my face most times I sing so
Mom if you were here today, I would put my arms around you
And tell you I love you (yeah)
I'd tell you I love you
Yeah, I would put your hand in mine, and tell you everything's okay
Oh I miss you
Oh I miss you

I never thought I'd have to say goodbye to you so soon
But now you're gone (Now you're gone)
Now you're gone (Now you're gone)
I never thought I'd have to say goodbye but now I do
And I miss you (And I miss you)
Oh I miss you (Oh I miss you)
We're born in a storm
It started in a dream
And God made me realize
Life ain't what it seems
Selfishly inspired
A heart exposed
Hit me with a passion that brought me to my knees

I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be selfish
Anymore, anymore, no
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be selfish
Anymore, anymore, no

Hearts healed
Eyes open wide
Apparent I'm shifted
Communities engaged
Vindicated by grace
God's now in control
I'm finally addicted to this beautiful change

I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be selfish
Anymore, anymore, no
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be selfish
Anymore, anymore, no

I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be selfish
Anymore, anymore, no
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be selfish
Anymore, anymore, no

This is the time
This is the moment where everything changes
This is where I, I draw the line
I can no longer take it
This is the time
This is the moment where everything changes
This is where I, I draw the line
I can no longer take it (oooh)
This is the time (this is the time, this is the time)
This is the moment where everything changes (to change)
This is where I, I draw the line (this is the moment, ooh, yeah)
I can no longer take it (I draw the line, I can no longer take it)
Yeah
I'm looking for that overdose
Heh
Yeah

When I say I want that overdose, it ain't about the drugs
I'm talkin' 'bout the Holy Ghost  runnin' through my blood
I'm lookin' for that overflow, somethin' I can love
You think the show's over? Oh no, it's just begun (c'mon)
You can call me special feature, yeah it's nice to meet ya
But my name is not what I came to teach ya
Yo, I know a God who can save ya, won't leave ya
He don't show His face, well He don't really need to
I give Him the glory for everything I have
He's more than just a story or something of the past
I ain't afraid to talk about it, ain't afraid to act
See, I'm just being me, man, and I don't need a mask
You all about the fast life, livin' for the money
A lot of people act like rap, tight gunnin'
Runnin' from the cops, see, to me that's nothing
But according to you, yeah, that might mean somethin'
That's why I give it to you in a form you understand
Cause sometimes in life things never go as planned
And sometimes you might feel like there's no chance
Quit tryna control it and just put it in His hands
You feel me?

He could be your comfort when you're broken
I'm lookin' for that overdose, yeah
I don't care, let it overflow
He could be your Savior, be your friend
I'm lookin' for that overdose, yeah
I don't care, let it overflow

If God's so real, why the world so crazy?
The rape rate climbin' and girl's havin' babies
Murders in the streets, murders in the schools
If God really cared He wouldn't let the pain pursue
But a lot o' y'all are lookin' from the wrong angle
And overdose in sin, and hey, your whole life tangles
You look in the Bible, even Satan was an angel
That just goes to show what lust for power will create you
Into something crazy, into something pitiful
You don't want the truth now, you'll get it at your funeral
Some think it's a joke, overdose, keep laughing
Ain't gon' be so funny when you layin' in your casket
God, He can save you; I ain't tryna play you
I'm just tryna represent the one and only Savior
Lies of the world will leave you like a broken heart
Hey, you lookin' for the same thing that tore you apart

He could be your comfort when you're broken
I'm lookin' for that overdose, yeah
I don't care, let it overflow
He could be your Savior, be your friend
I'm lookin' for that overdose, yeah
I don't care, let it overflow

God could be your overdose, so let me explain it
Ye ain't got the picture yet, you got the wrong paint
Now I know I'm hittin' you with a lot of information
But what I'm tryna do is introduce you to a Savior (Jesus)
I worship a God that made the world in six days
I worship a God that will never turn away (turn away)
I worship for truth, yeah, I worship for faith
And even if you kill me, you couldn't take that away
I'm livin' for that overdose, someone get me high
I'mma represent Him with my flow until I die
Devil say you're hopeless, it's just all up in your mind
I'd rather die for truth than live forever for a lie

He could be your comfort when you're broken
I'm lookin' for that overdose, yeah
I don't care, let it overflow
He could be your Savior, be your friend
I'm lookin' for that overdose, yeah
I don't care, let it overflow

He could be, He could be your comfort
He could be, He could be your Savior

Easy money
It's about to be a surgical summer
Chop the tops off the coupes
The cuatrociento' ochenta y ocho
The Spider joint
And you know we gotta cut the heads off these snakes, right?
Watch the body drop

Drug dealin' aside, ghostwritin' aside
Let's have a heart-to-heart about your pride
Even though you're multi, I see that your soul don't look alive
The M's count different when Baby divides the pie, wait
Let's examine why
Your music for the past few years been angry and full of lies
I'll start it at the home front—"I'm on One"
Dennis Graham stay off the 'Gram, bitch, I'm on one
You mention wedding ring like it's a bad thing
Your father walked away at five—hell of a dad thing
Marriage is somethin' that Sandi never had, Drake
How you a winner but she keep comin' in last place?
Monkey-suit Dennis, you parade him
A Steve Harvey-suit nigga made him
Confused, always felt you weren't Black enough
Afraid to grow it 'cause your 'fro wouldn't nap enough
Since you name-dropped my fiancée
Let 'em know who you chose as your Beyoncé
Sophie knows better as your baby mother
Cleaned her up for IG, but the stench is on her
A baby's involved, it's deeper than rap
We talkin' character, let me keep with the facts
You are hiding a child, let that boy come home
Deadbeat mothafucka playin' border patrol, ooh
Adonis is your son
And he deserves more than an Adidas press run, that's real
Love that baby, respect that girl
Forget she's a pornstar, let her be your world, yuugh!
How dare you put Ye in my verses?
I'm selfish, I want all of the curses
I'm pre-bookin' the churches, me versus three hearses
If we all go to Hell it'll be worth it
Already aligned with the greats, and on that same note
The only ones I chase are two ghosts
Still givin' you classics, that's the only thing that dates me
OVO 40, hunched over like he 80—tick, tick, tick
How much time he got? That man is sick, sick, sick
I got the devil flow, nigga—six-six-six
Surgical summer with it—snip, snip, snip
And you don't really want it with him

Surgical Summer, Volume 1
We gon' take this slow
We just gon' peel it back layer-by-layer
Yeah, DAYTONA
Album of the motherfuckin' year
And you talkin' 'bout you upset
Hahahahaha
Well, I wanna see what it's like when you get angry, okay?
You show me that
Push!
Shake that body, party that bod-
Shake that body, party that bod-
Shake that body, party that body
Come and have a good time with G-O-D

I believe there's a God above me
I'm just the god of everything else
I put holes in everything else
"New God Flow," fuck everything else
Supreme dope dealer, write it in bold letters
They love a nigga's spirit like Pac at the Coachella
They said Push ain't fit with the umbrella
But I was good with the yay as a wholesaler
I think it’s good that 'Ye got a blow dealer
A hot temper, matched with a cold killer
I came aboard for more than just to rhyme with him
Think ’99, when Puff woulda had Shyne with him, yuugh!
Matchin' Daytonas, rose gold on us
Goin' H·A·M in Ibiza done took a toll on us
But since you overdo it, I'ma pour more
Well if you goin' coupe, I’m goin' four door

Shake that body, party that bod- (that's rare, nigga!)
Shake that body, party that bod- (Ric Flair, nigga!)
Shake that body, party that body (yeah, nigga!)
Come and have a good time with G-O-D (yeah)
Shake that body, party that bod- (woah!)
Shake that body, party that bod- (woah!)
Shake that body, party that body (it's the new God flow, niggas)
Come and have a good time with G-O-D (yo)

Step on they necks 'til they can’t breathe
Claim they five stars but sell you dreams
They say death multiplies by threes
Line them all up and let's just see
Fuck em 'Ye, fuck em 'Ye!
I wouldn't piss on that nigga with Grand Marnier
(Woo!) They shit is shoppin' at Targét
(Woo!) My shit is luxury Balmain (ay!)
I'm balling, Amar'e
A nick sold in the park then I want in
What's a king without a crown, nigga? (What?)
What's a circus without you clown niggas? (Hah)
What's a brick from an outta-town nigga
When you flood and you can drown niggas? (Yuuugh!)
Here's the G.O.O.D. Music golden child
M.A. dollar sign, can't nobody hold me down

Shake that body, party that bod-
Shake that body, party that bod-
Shake that body, party that body
Come and have a good time with G-O-D

Hold up, I ain't trying to stunt, man
But the Yeezys jumped over the Jumpman
Went from most hated to the champion god flow
I guess that's a feeling only me and LeBron know
I'm living three dreams
Biggie Smalls', Dr. King, Rodney King's, uhh
Cause we can't get along - no resolution
'Til we drown all these haters, rest in peace to Whitney Houston
Cars, money, girls and the clothes
Aww man, you sold your soul
Naw man, mad people was frontin'
Aww man, made somethin' from nothin'
Picture workin' so hard, and you can't cut through
That can mess up your whole life, like an uncle that touched you
What has the world come to? I'm from the 312
Where cops don't come through and dreams don't come true
Like there the God go, in his Murcielago
From workin' McDonalds, barely payin' the car note
He even got enough, to get his mama a condo
Then they ran up and shot him, right in front of his mom
40 killings in a weekend, 40 killings in a week
Man, the summer too hot, you can feel it in the street
Welcome to Sunday service, if you hope to someday serve us
We got green in our eyes, just follow my Erick Sermon
Did Moses not part the water with the cane?
Did strippers not make an ark when I made it rain?
Did Yeezy not get signed by Hov and Dame?
And ran to Jacob and made the new Jesus chains?
In Jesus' name, let the choir say
"I'm on fire, ay," that's what Richard Pryor say
And we'll annihilate anybody that violate
Ask any dope boy you know, they admire 'Ye

Shake that body, party that bod-
Shake that body, party that bod-
Shake that body, party that body
Come and have a good time with G-O-D

Yeah nigga, yeah I had my, I had my Jesus piece since ‘94
I don’t know what I, I don’t know what y'all talkin’ bout
And my eagle — still got it all in the bag, B
Yeah, all I did was play possum
Yo, come on

Six hundred Cuban cigar in the big tub
Medallion on, Dove soap on the fresh cut
With soap suds on the Mac-11
My big lion haven’t ate since twelve, and it’s after seven
We feed the nigga like forty chickens
His tail wag when I send him a bag with just one victim
Uh-huh, now let me show you what my closet on
Gems in the display case, call it a rock-a-thon
I got soccer moms payin' for cock
Asians get it from behind while they cleanin’ their wok
Comin' with flows that is toxic
Deadly fumes when I'm in the room
Repercussions occur when you dry snitch
Red light, green light, one, two, three
Look mean, got my machine, cried and hit you, please
Say shake that body, scar up that body
Should I kill him now Tone? I said probably
Side bets are four and better
Bust hammers with pot holders
And yo, dead a cow for his fuckin' leather
I’m not bow-legged but old school like Redd Foxx
My favorite color in my hustle days was red tops
My gold eagle arm shitted out a red rock
Threw it off my project roof, saw red dots
Kanye, shine a light on my Wallabees
You can have a good time with G.O.D

Shake that body, party that bod- (that's rare, nigga!)
Shake that body, party that bod- (Ric Flair, nigga!)
Shake that body, party that body (yeah, nigga!)
Come and have a good time with G-O-D (yeah)
Shake that body, party that bod- (woah!)
Shake that body, party that bod- (woah!)
Shake that body, party that body (it's the new God flow, niggas)
Come and have a good time with G-O-D (yo)

G.O.O.D. Music! G.O.O.D. Music!
G.O.O.D. Music! G.O.O.D. Music!
And all my niggas say "G.O.O.D. Music!"
And all my ladies say "G.O.O.D. Music!"
I don't know but I've been told
(I don't know but I've been told)
If you get fresh get all the hoes
(If you get fresh get all the hoes)
I'm way fresher than all my foes
(I'm way fresher than all my foes)
Somebody please pick out they clothes
(Somebody please pick out they clothes)
And all my niggas say "G.O.O.D. Music!"
And all my ladies say "G.O.O.D. Music!"
Who runnin' shit today? G.O.O.D. Music!
Who runnin' shit today? G.O.O.D. Music!
Twenty-plus years of selling Johnson & Johnson
I started out as a baby-faced monster
No wonder there's diaper rash on my conscience
My teething ring was numbed by the nonsense
Gem Star razor and a dinner plate
Arm & Hammer and a Mason jar, that's my dinner date
Then crack the window in the kitchen, let it ventilate
'Cause I let it sizzle on the stove like a minute steak
Nigga, I was crack in the school zone
Two beepers on me, Starter jacket that was two-toned
Four lockers, four different bitches got their mule on
Black Ferris Bueller, cutting school with his jewels on
Couldn't do wrong with a chest full of chains and a arm full of watches
What I sell for pain in the hood, I'm a doctor
Zhivago tried to fight the urge like Ivan Drago, if he dies, he dies
Like Doughboy to Tre, if he rides, he rides
Throwing punches in his room, if he cries, he cries
We don't drink away the pain when a nigga die
We add a link to the chain, inscribe a nigga name in your flesh
We playin' on a higher game of chess
Once you delegate his bills, who gon' fuck his bitch the best?
A million megapixels of the Pyrex
Started on the scale digital, my only Timex
Nigga, this is timeless, simply 'cause it's honest
Pure as the fumes that be fuckin' with my sinus
Nigga, this is Simon Says, Simon red
Blood on your diamonds 'til you dying – dead; yuugh!

"You better change what comes out your speaker"
"Dee-dee-dee, dah-dee, dah-dee, dee-dee, dah-dee, day-ah" (What is it?)

You wanna see a dead body?
Instrumentals from my momma's Christmas party
Troubles on my mind
I still smell crime, my little brother crying
Smokers repeatedly buying my Sega Genesis, either that
Or my auntie was stealing it, hit the pipe and start feeling it
Ooh, wee, cut me some slack, weed never did that
This was different, geez, Louise, please help me relax
Quantum physics could never show you the world I was in
When I was ten, back when nine ounces had got you ten
And nine times out of ten, niggas don't pay attention
And when there's tension in the air, nines come with extensions
My daddy turned a quarter piece to a four and a half
Took a L, started selling soap fiends bubble bath
Broke his nails misusing his pinky to treat his nose
Shirt buttoned open, taco meat laying on his gold
I said, "Daddy, one day, I'mma get you right with 36 zips
1000 grams of cocaine, then your name will be rich
Now you can rock it up or sell it soft as leather interior
Drop some ice cubes in it, Deebo on perimeter"
He said, "Son, how come you think you be my connect?"
I said, "Pops, your ass is washed up, with all due respect"
He said, "Well, nigga, then show me how it all makes sense"
Go figure, motherfucker, every verse is a brick, your son dope, nigga
Now reap what you sowed, nigga (Please reap what you sowed, nigga)
I was born in '87, my grand daddy a legend
Now the same shit that y'all was smoking is my profession, let's get it

"You better change what comes out your speaker"
"They must be on the dick of who?"
Ha ha ha ha ha

The game's fucked up
Niggas’ beats is bangin', nigga, ya hooks did it
The lyric pennin' equal the Trumps winnin’
The bigger question is how the Russians did it
It was written like Nas, but it came from Quentin
At the mercy of a game where the codes is missin'
When the CEO's blinded by the glow it's different
Believe in myself and the Coles and Kendricks
Let the sock puppets play in their roles and gimmicks
Shit, remember Will Smith won the first Grammy?
And they ain't even recognize Hov until "Annie"
So I don't tap dance for the crackers and sing Mammy
'Cause I'm ’posed to juggle these flows and nose candy (yugh)
Ferrari, my 40th, blew the candles out
Tom Brady’d you niggas, I had to scramble out
They be ridin' these waves, I pulled my sandals out
Jefe Latin my Grammy, I went the Spanish route
Oh, now it’s okay to kill Baby
Niggas looked at me crazy like I really killed a baby
Salute Ross 'cause the message was pure
He see what I see when you see Wayne on tour
Flash without the fire
Another multi-platinum rapper trapped and can't retire
Niggas get exposed, I see the cracks and I'm the liar?
Shit, I’ve been exposed, I took the crack and built the wire
Now who do you admire?
Your rap songs is all tryin' my patience
Them prices ain't real without inflation
I done flew it, I done grew it, been a conduit
Moynat bags on my bitches, I done blew it
See through it, neck, igloo it
Habla en español, I "y tu" it
Let Steven talk streamin' and Shazam numbers
I'll ensure that you gettin' every gram from us
Let's cram numbers, easily
The only rapper sold more dope than me was Eazy-E
How could you ever right these wrongs
When you don't even write your songs?
But let us all play along
We all know what niggas for real been waitin' on
Push

Infrared, yeah, you know what I mean?
Infrared, yeah, you know what I mean?

I'm gone, I'm gone, you hear me?
I'm gone
(Yeaaah!) How you feelin'?
(Fiiiine!) Feel alright?!

I'm so bossy, bitch, get off me
It's a different jingle when you hear these car keys
Your SL's missin' a S, nigga, your plane's missin' a chef
The common theme, see they both got wings
If you fly, do it to death, it's only one God, and it's only one crown
So it's only one king that can stand on this mound
King Push, kingpin, overlord
Coast Guard come a hundred goin' overboard
I got money with the best of 'em
Go blow for blow with any Mexican
Don't let your side bitches settle in
Might have to headbutt your Evelyn
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
Hard to get a handle on this double-edged sword
Whether rappin' or I'm rappin' to a whore
Might reach back and relapse to wrappin' up this raw
Givenchy fittin' like it's gym clothes
We really gymstars, I'm like D. Rose
No D-League, I'm like this close
'88 Jordan, leapin' from the free throw

Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards

(Motherfuckers can't rhyme no more, 'bout crime no more)
Mix drug and show money, Biggs Burke on tour
25 bricks, move work like chore
Hit Delaware twice, needed 25 more
I see flaw, cracks in your diamond
CB4 when you rhyme, Simple Simon
Come and meet the pieman, a must that I flaunt it
The legend grows legs when it comes back to haunt us
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
Can't a bitch livin' say I bought her Michael Kors
Every car driven was decided by the horse
Keep the sticker in the window 'case you wonder what it cost
How could you relate when you ain't never been great?
And rely on rap money to keep food up on your plates, nigga?
I might sell a brick on my birthday
36 years of doin' dirt like it's Earth Day, God

Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
It's the blackout, 'Rari got the back out
Showing my black ass, engine in the glass house
Started in the crack house, Obama went the back route
Kill bin Laden, 'nother four up in the black house
Still got the Macs out, pull the mask down like a mascot
Still trick with bitches, out with money or with ass shots
GOOD had room for one more, I took the last spot
Re-Up Gang, P the nigga, 'Ye done hit the jackpot
Whole 'nother level, then you add fame
That's a whole 'nother devil, legit drug dealer
That's a whole 'nother bezel, the carbon Audemar
That's a whole 'nother metal, but still keep it ghetto
Behind the scenes, pull strings like Gepetto
The gun blow steam, whistle like a tea kettle
Runnin' like the rebels, UNLV
Sport shoe on a pedal, I let you niggas settle

Trouble on my mind
I got trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
So much trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
I got trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
So much trouble on my mind

Pharrell said "get 'em", so I got 'em
Tripped on Bristol Palin then I accidentally shot 'em
Then it ricocheted and killed the game, I'm a problem
Cause I wanna fuck the world but not a fan of using condoms
Pardon my French, I'm going hard as my dick
When I envision my tip on the crust of bitch lips
Mr. Lipschitz has been trippin'
Since I mentioned Reptar triceratops dinosaur dick
I feel it in my gut to kill these muthafucks
Is a must, like the arm of my pits
You niggas coming shorter than a Bushwick Billy costume
On sale during Christmas in Philly
Um, well, not really, it's getting kinda chilly
Let's hit a couple bars and give some bitches wet willies
Soaked, getting jiggy with it in Bel-Air's richest
With a bag of pills, couple berries and a biscuit

Trouble on my mind
I got trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
So much trouble on my mind

I'm a fucking walking paradox
And a really shitty rapper in my favorite pair of socks
Ironed pair of dockers, two Glocks cocked screamin', "West side!"
With the speakers blastin' a pair of Pacs
Yonkers 10 milli, you're silly
Thinkin' that this 'preme wasn't free, willy
The feeling is neutral, the gang is youthful
And fuckin' tighter than Chad Hugo's pupils, it's Wolf Gang and the

With the Re-Up's a helluva buzz
Rick James said cocaine's a helluva drug
Who else could put the hipsters with felons and thugs
And paint a perfect picture of what sellin' it does?
This is for the critics, who doubted the chemistry
Two different worlds, same symmetry
And this black art, see the wizardry when you at the top
Of your game, you make enemies, you'll never finish me

Trouble on my mind
I got trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
So much trouble on my mind
Valentino summers and wave runners
Chains on my niggas like slave runners
Drug dealers anonymous
How many Madonnas can that Mazda fit?
My brick talk is more than obvious, it’s ominous
Garages, the phantom, ghouls, ghosts and goblins
Blonde mohawk the collection I’m Dennis Rodman
The money count is the only moment of silence
Cause hush money balances all this drugs and violence
Hat trick under my mattress
Date I stop still has an asterisk after it
After all I can make a call
I can baptize a brick
As I wash away my sins like a catholic
Who the fuck ain't mastered this
America’s nightmare's in Flint
Children of a lesser God when your melanin’s got a tint
And I can’t even mention what I sent or what I spent
Cause my name in 18 wheelers is evidence
I put my boos in those cruise collections
Life’s a bitch
A to Z on her shoe collection, take your pick
Paid in full like ’86, Gs on my body
The new Gucci has less monograms, God’s got him
Let he without sin cast the first stone
So I built that all glass quad level first home
Shatter all of your misconceptions
Hold all of them missing weapons
You thought I would miss my blessing
The ultimate misdirection ya

Your husband was drug dealer
For 14 years he sold crack cocaine

Federico Fellini in the flesh
Sergio Tacchini inside his mesh
Bitch I been brackin’ since the ‘80s
Google me baby, you crazy
’89 in London pull the Benz up
Type it in, Google’s your friend bruh
14-year drug dealer and still counting
Who deserves the medal of freedom is my accountant
He been hula hooping through loop holes, working around shit
IRS should’ve had the townhouses surrounded
Thanks to the lawyers
I marbled the foyer
I tore the floor up
Yeah, that’s for the Koi fish
We been dining on oysters
I walk though the garage it’s like multiple choices
I told ‘em pull the Royce up
I’m getting ghost, I’m hearing noises
I think it’s the boys, but I been banking at Deutsche
We got storefronts, we got employee stubs
We been opening studios and 40/40s up
The paper trail is gorgeous
Cases we buries ‘em
Before Reasonable Doubt dropped, the jury hung
Bling bling
Every time I come around your city bling bling
My tenure took me through Virginia
Ask Teddy Riley ‘bout me
Ask the Federalis ‘bout me
Tried to build a cell around me
Snatched my nigga Emory up
Tried to get him to tell about me
He told 12, “Gimme 12”
He told them to go to hell about me
Drug dealers anonymous
Y’all think Uber’s the future, our cars been autonomous
Mules move the drums, take ‘em to different spots
We just call the shots by simply moving our thumbs
I’m a course of miracles with this shit
Nothing real can be threatened, nothing unreal exists
Therein lies the piece of God
I always knew I was a prophet, but I couldn’t find a decent job
Life made me ambidextrous
Countin’ with my right, whippin’ white with my left wrist
Daaaaaaaamn Daniel
FBI keep bringing them all white vans through

These women ain't shit but hoes with tricks
Baby girl, you different
When you're not around, it feels like something's missing
And I know you keep it real
Never tell no lie
Know you heard what they say
True love is hard to find
I just might trust you with my drugs
Trust you with my money
Just might trust you with my drugs
Might trust you with my money
Girl, I'll trust you with my drugs
Might trust you with my money
Might just trust you with my drugs
Might trust you with my money, girl

Started out as just a fuck mission
Who'd have thought I would've fucked with ya
Dope boy, they got trust issues
Never imagined being stuck with you
Years later, we in the villa suites
Top back, we on vanilla seats
Reminiscing about my episodes
With them extra hoes, but you didn't cheat
Cold nights when you couldn't sleep
Celine bags were the given treat
C-Class helped you see past
All them other hoes, and that they niggas weak
Whoo! I'm good money
Got you talking in dollar signs
It's all good that she the top bitch
But she just wanna know the bottom line
I don't blame her, I don't change her
I just sit back and give her options
Phillip Lim, Derek Lam
Every baller gotta know she's sponsored
Whoo! You earned that
Now where the fuck did you learn that?
We turnt up, we turnt out
We too far gone to ever turn back


Locked phones, past tense
Pass codes, we past this
Pass time, Presidential
Rolexes, both sexes
Blue bezel we both flexing
Big diamonds, we Bowflexing
Pitch dope, touch down
Both sports, I'm Bo Jackson
Your bitch fronting, that's you
My bitch stunting, that's me
I break it down, then break her off
I'm breaking bread, and that's key
We everything that they talk about
Know them haters be watching
Them bitches lurking -- your page locked
And they still know when you shopping
They still know that I'm balling
You still know that I'm all in
Your ex nigga, your next nigga
Gon' hate the fact that I'm spoiling
Whoo! But you earned that
Now where the fuck did you learn that?
We turnt up, we turnt out
We too far gone to ever turn back


Please don't mind
I just need some time
These requirements
Just gotta make sure you meet all mine
Standing there staring, with your bow-legged stance
Trust being nothing you could hold in your hand
Hustle in the hood, strong with the bands
Look at you as something more than a ho I could smash
Or being something bad I could bone at the bag
Pole in my pants standing at attention
When you step out of the shower and your ass is wiggling
Glance at the ceiling
Now your glass is empty
Thinking backwards, really
I done grabbed a vixen
That supposed to be a fitter after video
Stacks'll really blow
Dancers get exposed
Missing you when you not around
We text each other when out of town
You remain the same no matter up or down
These other women stay pretending
Money come and they help us spend it
But'll fuck my niggas in the very minute
I was down and out and had to go to prison
Kinda high role play, acki
And again I say I like these hoes
Niggas talkin' shit, Push—how do you respond?

I'm top five and all of them Dylan
I am the hope, the dope dealers won
Price and the quote, the dope dealers want
Feds takin' pictures like it's GQ (GQ)
This Avianne collarbone is see-through
Angel on my shoulder, "What should we do?" (we do)
Devil on the other, "What would Meek do?"
Pop a wheelie, tell the judge to Akinyele
Middle fingers out the Ghost, screamin' "Makaveli" (come with me)
Hail Mary, the scale fairy
Two sides to every coin so we bail ready (bail ready)
How do you respond?
I let the monies and the fools talk
I let the jewels and the hues talk
Watch face came with a fuse box (fuse box)
Chanel's on ya bitch
The coupe is 320, the roof's hit or miss
Murder on the highway, the news is at six
See, I did it my way, the proof's in the bricks
Eghck! Smell it through the Tupperware (Tupperware)
Two can get you four like a double dare (woo!)
I'm the king of the oven-ware (oven-ware)
You can piece the whole puzzle here

Niggas talkin' shit, 'Ye—how do you respond?

Poop, scoop!
Whoop! Whoopty-whoop!
Am I too complex for ComplexCon?
Everything Ye say cause a new debate
"You see, he been out of touch, he cannot relate
His hallway too long, bitch too bad
Got a surrogate, his kid get two dads"
I be thinkin', "What would 2Pac do?"
You be thinkin' what New Kids on the Block do
If you ain't drivin' while Black, do they stop you?
Will MAGA hats let me slide like a drive-thru?
That phone call from Ricky still hazy
When heaven got an angel named Avery
You gotta watch who you callin' crazy
Yeezy, the newest billion-dollar baby
It won't feel right 'til I feel like Phil Knight
Goin' for six rings like what Phil told Mike
Seven pill nights, who know what that feel like?
No more hidin' the scars, I show 'em like Seal, right?
How do you respond?
Dis type ah shit happen everyday
All dem a gwaan dem heart softer than clay
None ah dem have the guts to rise it and spray
None ah dem have the guts to bust the SK

Pray to Lord on my shotta
She be proper

All praise to the most high on both sides
I pray to God, I pray for hard, I won't lie
Multi cause I'm dope-tied, convo and a boat ride
Rent-a-cars for the whole month, drop Porsche money, no co-sign
Yuugh, my records ain't got to sell, nigga
Woo, go diamond off of my cell, nigga
Give a fuck what you sells, that chance come, I take mine
I ball hard, you bench ride, so fuck you and yo' baseline
No Soundscan for a bricklayer, square nigga, you a brick hater
We see a bitch, you fall in love, I fall back cause my bitch date her
Where I'm from, we go crazy with them choppas
Sellin' dope, goin' diamond on my blocka

Pray to Lord on my shotta

Diamond on my blocka, all we got is white girl
All we got is choppas, all you hear is choppas

Dopeboy to the rescue, bad bitches get the best view
Lotta money just floatin' round, all them hoes feelin' special
Woo, I know the rent due, fuck me right and it's sent through
Third time you done used the line, God damn, she a pimp, too
Teamwork make the dream work, all my niggas done seen work
All my niggas ain't make it through, so much death that my dreams hurt
Where I'm from, we go crazy with them choppas
Sellin' dope, goin' diamond on my blocka

I got dollars on my blocka
Serve it to my flocka

To my flocka
Pray to Lord on my shotta

Lyrically I’m, untouchable, uncrushable
Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600
Untouchable, uncrushable
Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600

Yuugh, I drops every blue moon
To separate myself from you kings of the YouTube
I am more U2, I am like Bono with the Edge
In Mexico, fuck Donald and his pledge
Legend has it, the wrist is magic
The left is Patek, Philippe's replaced by Matsuhisa
Ignore most requests for the feature
Unless it’s getting played on the beach in Ibiza
While she fucking Nesha and she sucking shisha
Can’t you see my Total; Pam, Kima, Keisha
I’m aiming for the moguls, why y'all niggas aiming at the locals?
And rap niggas broke like them, they’re mere hopeful
Still wishing on a star
The last one to find out that Baby own the cars
The final trilogy of Jaws
The grills like, interior gauze
It feels like, still white
Matching Missoni looks African on me
They tryin’ pin this trafficking on me like Mano and Tony
My thoughts spilling over
The soft ceiling’s open, I Cross-Fit the coca
Yuugh! It’s a different calisthenics when I do the Lennox
Half a million paralleled and ain’t nothin’ rented
Yeah, wearing Dri-Fit in my shit
It rides a little better in the cockpit

Untouchable, uncrushable
Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600
Untouchable, uncrushable
Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600

Mu told me to switch styles
He just came home from the Feds like a mistrial
He tells me I miss out on all that club money, I don’t bounce
Adidas gave me a million and that don’t bounce
The president of G.O.O.D. Music has been announced
A quarter million a year and that don’t bounce
I’m in the score of these movies, I’m losing count
Mu, you knew me from thirteen hundred an ounce
My breakdown game bought me ‘8 Mile’ fame
Selling Eminem to him and ‘em
White to the Blacks I’m a villain in
The Rolls Royce, playing peek-a-boo with the emblem
Let’s talk about it gentlemen
My barcode is Netflix “Narcos”
Part on the side of my 'fro like I’m Pablo
No hablo, I sell blow
Lone wolf, no Tonto, head honcho
Yuugh, let’s take the scenic route
I could show you the strange fruit
It’s looking like Beirut
They open the wash bay, I climb it like K2
These kilos are drought killers, I flooded the Jesús, I made use
Of every Spanish name I done ran across
No matter what the weight, I done ran it off
I’m walking on water, I took the sandals off
Tell A&E to turn the cameras off, Push

Untouchable, uncrushable
Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600
Untouchable, uncrushable
Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600
I don't never feel pain, 'cause I done felt too much pain
Money goin' in the rain, blood flowing through my veins
I'm just doing my thing, get money, baby girl, gold chains
I don't never feel pain, 'cause I done felt too much pain
Standing in the rain, blood flowing through my veins
I ain't never did a thing, getting money, rocking chains
We'll never feel the same, we the thugs in the game
I don't never feel pain

18 wheeler gorillas
Black with gold chains, pitch bird like Steelers
Hines Ward of the crime lords
Running through this money screaming "encore"
Spending nights with the prime whore
But that's the bitch that you're blind for
Celebrating on a whim, nigga
Pain is Pac Above the Rim, nigga
My bitch rock a bigger gem, niggas
Cause she was there when it was dim, nigga
She wasn't fucking none of them niggas
So now we're even like a hem, nigga
Put your freedom over failure
Tryna find my Griselda (La Madrina!)
Might as well, they gon' nail ya
Momma screaming like Mahalia
Pain is love and it's war
Pain is running out of raw
Pain is finding out you're poor
As the Feds knock at your door

I don't never feel pain, 'cause I done felt too much pain
Been around here, standing in the rain, blood flowing through my veins
I'm just doing my thing, getting money, rocking tons of gold chains
I don't never feel pain, 'cause I done felt too much pain
I'm just standing in the rain, blood flowing through my veins
I'm just doing my thing, getting money, rock a hundred gold chains
Million dollars on one gold ring

Pain is joy when it cries
It's my smile in disguise
It's what makes the story chilling
Spare the women and the children
Hear the scribbles of the villain, yugh!
This is drug dealer brilliance
Pyrex on the platter like hot sex
But my tribe don't quest like love
Pain in this bitch, with a mask and a glove
And a team of lawyers to run the train on the judge
It's no risk without gain
It's no trust without shame
It's no us without 'caine
Push, my name is my name
In the kitchen with a cape on, apron
Tre-eight on, coulda been Trayvon
But instead I chose Avon
Powder face like a geisha
Arm & Hammer for the breakup
Turn one into two, watch the brick kiss and makeup (woo!)
It's a match made in heaven
All that's missing is the reverend
All that's missing is a blessing
I hope God gets the message

I don't never feel pain, 'cause I done felt too much pain
Been around here, standing in the rain, blood flowing through my veins
I'm just doing my thing, getting money, rocking tons of gold chains
I don't never feel pain, 'cause I done felt too much pain
I'm just standing in the rain, blood flowing through my veins
I'm just doing my thing, getting money, rock a hundred gold chains
Million dollars on one gold ring
*Kanye West harmonizes for 25 seconds*

I sold more dope than I sold records
You niggas sold records, never sold dope
So I ain’t hearing none of that street shit
'Cause in my mind, you motherfuckers sold soap
Got rich selling hope to the hopeless
But I’m a thinker, methodic in my motives
I motivate to put my niggas into motors
No woman, no child, no witness, no Jehovahs
Like Scarface but it's God's face in that mirror
We was made in his image, dialing and it's much clearer
Scoring from the heights but I wanted mine purer
Aryan, blonde hair, blue-eyed like the Führer
The judge and the jury, the jewellery mad froze
Watercolors on my neck, fuck rhyming when you blinding niggas
We ain't the same color clarity of diamond, nigga
Nah, I ain't got nothing in common with yous
Pain in my heart, it's as black as my skin
They tipping the scale for these crackers to win
No reading, no writing, made us savage of men
They praying for jail but I mastered the pen
Descended from kings, we at it again
Just hand me the crown, I'm active again
Everything that it seems, hear my passion again
Was never my dream, the immaculate win

I was pissing my shorts, having rich nigga thoughts
Wish I had a pistol before all the friends I done fought
Overnight I seen a nigga go get a Carrera
Two weeks later I had to be that boy pallbearer
Young king bury me inside a glass casket
Windex wipe me down for the life after
Crack dealer living like a hoop star
Black marble, white walls in my new spot
Four chains, big studs, a nigga too fly
Top down, tank top, I think I'm 2Pac
So I'm labeled the rebel, nigga get on my level
We were born to be kings, only major league teams
Chasing my paper, couldn't fathom my wealth
Built a school in Ethiopia, should enroll in myself
God body and mind, food for the soul
When you feeding on hate, you empty, my nigga, it shows
Follow the codes, ain’t no love for these hoes
If you slip and you fall I got you, my nigga, hold on
If you right or you wrong, if you riding, come on
By the end of this song, can't be hiding for long
I seen children get slaughtered, niggas' grandmothers assaulted
Throw a gang sign, dare you do something about it
Fuck copping them foams, when you copping the home
Cop a kilo and have them people on top of your home

Follow the codes, ain't no love for these hoes
If you slipping you fall, I got you, my nigga, hold on
If you right or you wrong, if you riding, come on
By the end of this song, I got you, my nigga, hold on
I got you, my nigga, hold on
I got you, my nigga, hold on
If you right or you wrong, if you riding, come on
By the end of this song, I got you, my nigga, hold on
I got you, my nigga, hold on
I got you, my nigga, hold on
I got you, my nigga, hold on
I got you, my nigga, hold on
This is my time, this is my hour
This is my pain, this is my name, this is my power
If it's my reign, then it's my shower
This pole position, I made a lane 'cause they blocked ours
Dope boys, block bleeders
Gold diggers don't stop either
Motivation is misguided
If you hit the mark, then it's not needed
Carry on like a carry on, on my side bitch I let tag along
Call me "daddy" from a complex
'Cause her mother's fucker wouldn't marry mom
No excuses, no regard
Step on the brick like a promenade
Twenty thousand on calling cards
And I'm speaking Spanish like Don Omar

But I'm King Push, this king push
I rap nigga 'bout trap niggas, I don't sing hooks

Fuck nigga with the sly talk
Miss me with all the pie talk
When them lights on you and them letters there
You point us out just like an eye-chart
But that's my fault, my details of the sidewalk
For eleven years, we seen better years
We was sellin' birds over the time port
My first Grammy was my first brick
Red carpet, every bad bitch
More BMF than Billboard
I got a label deal under my mattress

'Cause I'm King Push, still King Push
I rap nigga 'bout trap niggas, I don't sing hooks, ah!

Vultures to my culture
Exploit the struggle, insult ya
They name dropping 'bout Caine copping
But never been a foot soldier
Let's have another look, just get a little closer
Rage against the machine, black Zack de la Rocha
In a cranberry Rossta, inside track on the G rap poster
Best D-boy, all I'm missing is a dash
Difference between me and Hova

But I'm King Push, still King Push
I rap nigga 'bout trap niggas, I don't sing hooks, ah!
Trouble world, trouble child
Trouble times destroyed my smile
No change of heart, no change of mind
You can take what's yours but you gon' leave what's mine
I'd rather die, than go home
I'd rather die, than go home
And I ain't leaving without my 40 acres

Unpolished, unapologetic
This cocaine cowboy pushed it to the limit
You thought Tony in that cell would've made us timid
We found his old cell, bitch, we searchin' through the digits
Anything Spanish, got me speaking Spanglish
Money's universal, that's the only language
The dream ain't die, only some real niggas
We was born to mothers who couldn't deal with us
Left by fathers who wouldn't build with us
I had both mine home, let's keep it real, niggas
My better half chose the better path, applaud him
Younger brother me a spoiled child, I fought him
I heard that the Devil's new playground is boredom
The California top just falls back like autumn
And they say I'm on the verge of winning
I claim victory when Malice on the verge of sinning
Old habits die hard, that rainy day bag buried in the backyard
It's heaven for a hustler, no graveyards
'Cause stand-up niggas don't lie on no floors
Much rather burn us, ashes to ashes
Mix us with the powder, sell us to the masses
We gon' keep it tight, rip it off the plastic
Now you celebrate, motherfuckers, raise your glasses
Push...

Trouble world, trouble child
Trouble times destroyed my smile
No change of heart, no change of mind
You can take what's yours but you gon' leave what's mine
I'd rather die, than go home
I'd rather die, than go home
And I ain't leaving without my 40 acres

Unpolished, unapologetic
Might have broke a heart or two but gave an honest effort
My nonchalant attitude is always 'F it'
Thirty-five years of marriage and my momma left it
You shouldn't question if you ever stood a chance with him
The better question is, did you enjoy the dance with him>
(Yughh!) I'll probably never pull you chair out, bitch
You know this money grew your hair out, switch
All that shit I bought you wear out
Rich, and I'm the only one I care about
Place none above me, God don't like ugly
Hate me or love me, only he can judge me
Unpolished, unapologetic
Big willie with the blow, niggas, I am legend
School of hard knock, I attended
Selling hard rock, fuck who I offended
I was a goner, punished by karma
Called him tar baby, now he’s transcending genres
The 911 came with the ass shots
A toothless crackhead was the mascot
The owner of the key to that padlock
I’m Jordan versus Cavs for the last shot
I need all mine, reparations
We growin' poppy seeds on my 40 acres
Push!

Trouble world, trouble child
Trouble times destroyed my smile
No change of heart, no change of mind
You can take what's yours but you gon' leave what's mine
I'd rather die, than go home
I'd rather die, than go home
And I ain't leaving without my 40 acres
You know what happen when G.O.O.D. Music and MMG get together, right?
We get that money

This shit cook up hard, don't it?
Y'all gotta beg my pardon on it
But this shit sound like God don't it?
Yuugh, I'm tired, nigga and y'all gotta pay your tithes, nigga
Call my Phantom the holy ghost, church on chrome wheel tires, nigga
Pop tags when I'm paranoid, cause the pawn shop was my paradise
I was dead pop when that powder came for that knot saved in that shoebox
Blue tops, blue tops, bad bitch in that blue fox
This big face is in blu-ray and these black diamonds like Boondocks
I restore the feelin' of when niggas made a killin'
Hidin' choppas in the closet, half a million in the ceiling
And them hoes with angel faces, cryin' loud with ill intentions
Just so I can buy them Christians, have 'em shittin' on all they bitches, ah!

Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling

Choppas-choppas in the closet

I'm haunted by horror stories, wanna-be home owners
Horrible outcome, a dope boy got one motive
Cries when he convicted, cried on every visit
I'm cryin' sayin' his name, ride for all my niggas
Used to fiddle my finger 'til I found me a fortune
Finger fuck a Ferrari, south of France early morning
Did drugs with Donatella, Versace my a cappella
Never see me in Neiman's, niggas committin' treason
Soft loafer preferred, frost, organic herb
Stay away from the Forbes, if I only could tell you more
I got this I got that, I got that I got this
Got a kilo for 20, my choppas say I'm the shit

Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet

This that shit y'all ask for
Make a nigga mash on the gas, floor
Two-door, four-door, roll through the hood like task force
Fast forward–oops! They say they wanna see proof
My record sales ain't much as theirs and we still ride the same coupes
How we still fuck the same hoes, why we still buy the same clothes
How we both got the same watch, I'm just keepin' y'all on y'all toes
Dope boys, gold mine, that price drop and that coke rise
Then set it over that blue flame then hang it dry like clothesline
I restore the feelin' of when niggas made a killin'
Hidin' choppas in the closet, half a million in the ceiling
Got the razor on the counter, Arm & Hammer in the kitchen
Just to keep my feet in Christians and keep fuckin' all y'all bitches

Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet

This that shit that ya'll wanted
This shit sound like God don't it
This that shit that ya'll wanted
This shit sound like God don't it
This that shit that ya'll wanted
This shit sound like God don't it
This that shit that ya'll wanted
This shit sound like God don't it
Pullin' up in that new toy
The wrist on that boy rockstar like Pink Floyd
Waving at rude boy, I'm wavin' at you, boy
Ran off on the plug too like Trugoy
Imagine me do-boy, you could never do what I do, boy
Still, duckin' shit that I did, boy
Niggas in Paris 'fore Hit-Boy
These ain't the same type of hits, boy
Shit can get litter than lit, boy
You don't take these type of risks, boy
'Cause this boy been throwin' that D like Rich Boy
You missed, boy
Ya numbers don't add up on the blow
That was ten years ago; if you know, you know (yeah)

If you know, you know
If you know, you know

This thing of ours, oh, this thing of ours
A fraternity of drug dealers ringin' off
I just happen to be alumni
Too legit, they still lookin' at me with one eye
The company I keep is not corporate enough
Child Rebel Soldier, you ain't orphan enough
A rapper turned trapper can't morph into us
But a trapper turned rapper can morph into Puff
Dance contest for the smokers
I predict snow, Al Roker
(If you know, you know)
I only ever looked up to Sosa
You all get a bird, this nigga Oprah

Bricklayers in ball shorts
Coachin' from the side of the ball court
(If you know, you know)
One stop like a Walmart
We got the tennis balls for the wrong sport
(If you know, you know)
If you know 'bout the carport
The trap door's supposed to be awkward
(If you know, you know)
That's the reason we ball for
Circle round twice for the encore
(If you know, you know)

You ever been hit with the water weight
Then had to weigh, "Do you war or wait?"
(If you know, you know)
When we all clickin' like Golden State
And you and your team are the motorcade
(If you know, you know)
Been grantin' wishes like a genie
Two bad hoes in two-piece bikinis
I've been hidin' where you can see me
The skybox is right next to RiRi's
Solely responsible for showin' rappers how to stand
On the front lines when trappers started throwin' bands
Where were you when Big Meech brought the tigers in?
'Cause I was busy earnin' stripes like a tiger's skin

Bricklayers in ball shorts
Coachin' from the side of the ball court
(If you know, you know)
One stop like a Walmart
We got the tennis balls for the wrong sport
(If you know, you know)
If you know 'bout the carport
The trap door supposed to be awkward
(If you know, you know)
That's the reason we ball for
Circle 'round twice for the encore
(If you know, you know)
I see the strangest things
The evil that money brings
I swear it’s like a disease
That goes round and round and round like sirens
And they wanna bury me
Why? Cause I’m anti everything
I swear it’s like a disease
That goes round and round and round like sirens

Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy after all
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy not at all
Get in them drawers
I had a dream I had it all
I woke up and really had it all

The three leading killers of you niggas
Is the shit that’s most appealing to you niggas
Even I fell victim to it, your pride don’t let you do it
The lies will get you through it
Money, pussy, alcohol, what a wonderful cocktail
Fronted my first brick over oxtails and ran with it
Dope is like a two-way street
The addiction, both you and me, now take a seat
Every car got a fleet, every broad get a jeep
Every sparkle in the club that wasn’t ours, we compete
Poor minds, poor decision makers
No reward, then what’s the risk you taking?
New bitch I been fucking might start a rap war
Won’t unveil it yet, can’t tell it yet
Defense wins games Bill Belichick
These hoes having Google numbers, niggas better check
Yuugh

Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy after all
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy not at all
Get in them drawers
I had a dream I had it all
I woke up and really had it all

Shout out my bitches fucking baseball niggas
That dress like Bamas with guaranteed contracts
Yeah, I see your vision, sick of prison visits
Now the Major League’s where you're fishing
You young and hot, so why not?
The dealers is washed, the money is dry, so take your best shot
We can’t judge you ‘cause we ain’t hug you
We sent you off to other hoods and let them niggas fuck you
For real, we made you watch from afar
Even talked down on you, tryna dim your star
Until we seen them foreign cars pull up
And watch them pick you up
And then we realized we missed a diamond in the rough
So, make us proud, make it count
Until you learn to love ‘em, make ‘em spare no amount
Make ‘em dig deeper to keep ya, knowing you deserve it
Take advantage of it when you’re worth it
Real bitches worth it

Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy after all
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy not at all
Get in them drawers
I had a dream I had it all
I woke up and really had it all

I’ve been watching all you real niggas
I done seen more won't than you will niggas
Take a swing, snatch a chain
Lose your mind, go insane
I’m in the club, you in the club too
I got money, you got money too
You think it’s honey dew
Whispering in my ear like a hunny do
Eyeballing every bottle that we running through
Trying to stand near, nigga damn near
Pushing bitches out the way to Instagram here
It’s no pictures, now you in your feelings
I’m a real dope boy, no stranger dealings
Bruised ego, Henny-induced Debos
Nickel bag niggas, all of a sudden Ninos
I cancel all of you G-Moneys for G money
I get it done for quarter ki money, for real

Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy after all
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy not at all
Get in them drawers
I had a dream I had it all
I woke up and really had it all
Now that the tears dry and the pain takes over
Let's talk this payola (payola)
You killed God's baby when it wasn't his will
And blood spill, we can't talk this shit over (this shit over)
The Lord is my shepherd, I am not sheep
I am just a short stone's throw from the streets
I bring my offerin', I will not preach
Awaken my demons, you can hear that man screaming
I'm no different than the priest, priest
Santeria (Santeria, Santeria, Santeria)

They say that death comes in threes, how appropriate ('propriate)
Triple back, they rush in like Soviets (Soviets)
At the Kremlin
Searchin' for the green like a Gremlin, presidential emblem
Presidential tint on this shit that I am driven in (woo!)
I just place orders and drop dollars
Rottweilers roam the grounds, the Glock hollers
The three of y'all too accessible
Seen all the wrong moves, watchin' The Untouchables
We don't do vegetables, niggas get flatlined
Welcome all beef, then we heat 'em with flat irons
Your plans are backfiring, think of double-crossin' a priest
Hail Mary, repeat after me
Santeria!

Ya te vas a la mañana (mañana)
Ha-ah, los ángeles esperarán
Es el fuego que yo—conozco
Es el fuego que yo—
Ya te vas a la mañana (mañana)
Ha-ah, los ángeles esperarán
Es el fuego que yo—conozco
Es el fuego que yo—

Of all the things I've ever paid for
Know that it's no price tag when I wage war
It's no more to pray for, niggas get preyed on
Darken my doorstep, they told me the day's gone
You listenin', De'Von?
As I'm talkin' to your spirit, for God's sakes
I'm dealin' with heartbreak
Checkin' my ego, I'm livin' with lost faith
I'm backin' this hit, nigga, you ever seen Shark Tank?
I paid 'em in small bills, all of 'em small face
I bet when we draw blood, you niggas will draw a blank
Dress you in all black, partnered with All Saints
Our numbers is all facts, my shooters give all thanks
And all praise, no jail bars can save
Leave you like Malcolm where X marks your grave
Hey, it's probably better this way
It's cheaper when the chaplain prays
Santeria!

Ya te vas a la mañana (mañana)
Ha-ah, los ángeles esperarán
Es el fuego que yo—conozco
Es el fuego que yo—
Creep up on these niggas
Creep up on these niggas
Speak up on these niggas
Speak up on a nigga
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Go and make it bang, go and make it bang
Gettin’ followed by them hollows, go and make it bang
Niggas ain’t been to church in a minute
But it’s funny how that TEC make a nigga get religious
Amen!

You rather be more famous than rich
Play your role, it’s easy acting like Mitch
“Paid In Full” was more than reading a script
Paid in full is really just being Rich Porter
Filling all standing orders
Would you question could I swim if you saw me walking on water?
Yeah, while every song got a rapper dance
Yuugh, I’m drug money like Dapper Dan
No retirement plans, no Derek Jeters
We all know I did it; Rodriguez
The illusion of money we don’t believe in
You ask me, Tyga looking like a genius
I’m Kim Jong of the crack song
Gil Scott-Heron to the black poem
Woo, the revolution will be televised
‘Cause we done see all and they telling lies

Creep up on these niggas
Creep up on these niggas
Speak up on these niggas
Speak up on a nigga
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Go and make it bang, go and make it bang
Gettin’ followed by them hollows, go and make it bang
Niggas ain’t been to church in a minute
But it’s funny how that TEC make a nigga get religious
Amen!

You rather be more famous than rich
Play your role, it’s easy being my bitch
It’s only right for a queen to floss your shit
Rolex crowns, I emboss your wrist
The minimums, niggas ain’t synonyms
Dual exhausts, driving flying saucers
Diamond crosses, hang Takashi portraits
Street millionaires rub shoulders
And laugh at bitches fucking promoters
Hoping that they get noticed, still driving a Focus
What you fuck him for if you didn’t know what the goal was?
Shine, remote control blinds
That turn on the time lapse, controlled by the iPad
Ahhh, my living room rap scream crack money
I don’t trust rap niggas or rap money
See this air hole tech and get ratttttt from me

Creep up on these niggas
Creep up on these niggas
Speak up on these niggas
Speak up on a nigga
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Go and make it bang, go and make it bang
Gettin’ followed by them hollows, go and make it bang
Niggas ain’t been to church in a minute
But it’s funny how that TEC make a nigga get religious
Amen!

Niggas talking it, but ain’t living it
Two years later admitting it, all them niggas is renting shit
They ask why I’m still talking dope, why not?
The biggest rappers in the game broke, voilà
They say it’s hate, but it’s these well-dressed snakes
That learn to walk on the concrete, I just saw it and spoke to it
Yuugh, you ain’t know, you got coached through it
Wooo, the rap fans got hoaxed through it
Haaa, the whole time I sold coke through it
Nigga, and records I was Bo through it
King Push is synonymous with kingpin
Chess moves on your checkerboard, king him
Yeah, this is gun slingers and Goyard
Uh, this is O Dog in the courtyard
You wonder why I’m still here
I’m America’s worst nightmare
Night, night nigga

Creep up on these niggas
Creep up on these niggas
Speak up on these niggas
Speak up on a nigga
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Go and make it bang, go and make it bang
Gettin’ followed by them hollows, go and make it bang
Niggas ain’t been to church in a minute
But it’s funny how that TEC make a nigga get religious
Amen!
Never trust a bitch who finds love in a camera
She will fuck you, then turn around and fuck a janitor
Set the parameters
You either with the pro ballers or the amateurs
I won't let you ruin my dreams or Harvey Weinstein the kid
Good mornin', Matt Lauer, can I live?
Look at my new digs
The rooftop can host a paint and sip for like 40
The Warhols on my wall paint a war story
Had to find other ways to invest
'Cause you rappers found every way to ruin Pateks
It's a nightmare, yeah
I'm too rare amongst all of this pink hair, ooh
Still do the Fred Astaire on a brick
Tap tap, throw the phone if you hear it click
Art Baselin' the bezel
Your bustdown is bust down and don't match the metal
Lower level's where you settle at
I'm the pot callin' the kettle black
Where there's no brick peddles at
Between God and where the Devil's at
Had to double dutch and double back
Then hopscotch through where the trouble's at
Exactly what the game's been missin'
This fire burns hot as Hell's Kitchen, Push

Now dat's how da ting go, I'm back from Santo Domingo
'cause dat's where the kings go, down in Santo Domingo
Now dat's how the ting go, I'm back from Santo Domingo
This for the sneaker hoarders and coke snorters
'Cause dat's where the kings go, down in Santo Domingo
From Honda Accords to Grammy awards
That's where the kings go

I can blow a million dollars into dust
Lord knows how many bottles I've done bust
Still runnin' through the models like I'm Puff
Confront my problems like I'm Ralo in the bluff
Pusha know these politics is paradox
Chillin' in a condo full of ready rock
My homie amputated, but gon' stand for somethin'
I'm dyin' to find a way to get a Grammy from it (Maybach Music)
Watchin' my success for some is bittersweet
Always keep the sharpshooter's triggers tweaked
Diamonds drippin' on me via Tiffany's
All these K-9 units still sniffin' me
Ignorance versus the innocence
It's not the temperature for you in Timberlands
I keep the coldest flows on the hot seat
And you can spot my hoes by their car keys
Another episode full of atrocities
It's double M, baby, money monopolies (Maybach Music)
You scared to see my face in a fancy place
So I debate my case vs. a Nancy Grace
It's flesh and blood 'til I'm fresh as fuck
Still hands on, sucker, press your luck
Your money gone every other month
My money long so the treasure's tucked

Now dat's how da ting go, I'm back from Santo Domingo
'cause dat's where da kings go, down in Santo Domingo
Now dat's how da ting go, I'm back from Santo Domingo
'Cause dat's where da kings go, down in Santo Domingo
Dat's where da kings go
Drug dealer Benzes with gold diggers in 'em
In elevator condos, on everything I love

This ain't a wave or phase, 'cause all that shit fades
This lifestyle's forever when you made
They tweet about the length I made 'em wait
What the fuck you expect
When a nigga got a cape and he's great?
Oven's full of cakes that he bakes, still spreadin' paste
The love just accentuates the hate
This is for my bodybuildin' clients movin' weight
Just add water, stir it like a shake
Play amongst the stars like the roof in the Wraith
Get the table next to mine, make our bottle servers race

These are the games we play, we are the names they say
This is the drug money your ex-nigga claim he makes

To all of my young niggas, I am your Ghost and your Rae
This is my Purple Tape, save up for rainy days
And baby mama wishes, along with the side bitches
They try to coexist, end up wishin' you'd die, bitches
Stood on every couch, in the A at the black party
No jewelry on, but you richer than everybody
You laugh a little louder, the DJ say your name a little prouder
And we don't need a globe to show you the world is ours
We can bet a hundred thousand with my safe hold
My numbers lookin' like a bank code

These are the games we play, we are the names they say
This is the drug money your ex-nigga claim he makes

Ain't no stoppin' this champagne from poppin'
The draws from droppin', the laws from watchin'
With Ye back choppin', the cars and the women come with options
Caviar facials remove the toxins
This ain't for the conscious, this is for the mud-made monsters
Who grew up on legends from outer Yonkers
Influenced by niggas straight outta Compton, the scale never lies
I'm two-point-two incentivised
If you ain't energized like the bunny for drug money
Or been paralyzed by the sight of a drug mummy
This ain't really for you, this is for the Goya Montoya
Who said I couldn't stop, then afforded me all the lawyers
The only kingpin who ain't sinkin'
Chess moves are made, my third eye ain’t blinkin
Stay woke, nigga, or get out
Still pull them whips out, still spread the chips out
Might buy your bitch some new hips and yank her rib out
The message in this music, all my niggas had to live out

These are the games we play, we are the names they say
This is the drug money your ex-nigga claim he makes, yah!
I wanna talk to all you addicts out there
That's got yourself a great big Jones
An' you done tried all the methadone
An' you just can't leave that heroin alone
I wonder, have you tried

Dope just touched down, I'm so grateful
Numbers so low, bitch, be thankful
They say don't let money change you
That's how we know money ain't you
Bitch, I been had, bitches been bad
We buy big boats, bitch, I'm Sinbad
Downright sinful, bitch, we been full
All my dopeboys, we like kinfolk
BMore burnt spoon, DC glass pipe
VA sent bales, 'bout that trap life
Blew through thousands, we made millions
Cocaine soldiers, once civilians
Bought hoes Hondas, took care children
Lent my pastor, build out buildin's
Rapped on classics, I been brilliant
Now we blend in, we chameleons, ahh!

Never have I been locked up in a world of misery
I need you darlin' to set me free
Come back, baby, try me one more time
Ooh, baby, I'm 'bout to go out of my mind
I can't—

Who else got the luxury to drop when he want
'Cause nobody else can fuck with me? What a show-off
Nigga, wrist for wrist—let's have a glow-off
Fuck it, brick for brick—let's have a blow-off
If we go by connections made
I can still climb ladders when complexions fade (yugh)
White on white, that's the Testa
Black on black, that's the Tesla
See these diamonds in this watch face?
All that shit came from pressure
They don't miss you 'till you gone with the wind
And they tired of dancin' like a Ying Yang Twin
You can't have the Yin without the Yang, my friend
Real niggas bring balance to the game I'm in (eghck!)
Can't escape the scale if I tried, interstate trafficking's alive
Push

Never have I been locked up in a world of misery
I need you darlin' to set me free
Come back, baby, try me one more time
Ooh, baby, I'm 'bout to go out of my mind
I can't—

Still fresh off the boat, niggas
Don't make me super-soak niggas
Your life ends up a quote, nigga
The good die young, all dogs go to heaven
It's really just momma's fallin' out on the reverend
I play musical chairs with these squares
Rich flair before they was Ric Flair's
Cocaine concierge, longest runnin' trapper of the year
Stood the test of time like Dapper Dan
Season my sauce like Zatarain's
Is he still in the caravan? (no)
It's a mil' in the caravan? (whoa)
Richard Mille on a leather band (whoo)
Behind the wheel like an ambulance (go)
On my way up to Maryland (gone)

Never have I been locked up in a world of misery
I need you darlin' to set me free
Come back, baby, try me one more time
Ooh, baby, I'm 'bout to go out of my mind
I can't—
Come back, baby, try me one more time
Ooh, baby, I'm 'bout to go out of my mind
I—I can't—
Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
Well, the walls are talking to me and I know you think I'm wrong
But sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!

Now when the phone start to click in, your words start to echo
Say you got to hang up but the man won't let go
Oh, my nigga say it ain't so
Now we speaking on some niggas that he say he ain't know
We used to steal dirt bikes, dodge raindrops
So close niggas thought we had the same pops
Graduated, gettin' money on the same blocks
But things changed and we ain't end up in the same box
Hearing whispers, "it ain't adding up"
Giving you the jailhouse talk but you ain't mad enough
I never thought I'd be the last man standing up
I never thought I'd had have to question "Were you man enough?"
Long letters how the streets got the best of you
Telling all your cellies how come I ain't sitting next to you
Yeah, see I can read between the lines
So it's awkward when you call and I gotta press 5

Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
I think the Feds are looking through me, can't you hear it in my tone?
So then sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!

Got me tiptoeing through the conversation on our calls
Tryna act normal but the writing is on the wall
It's like I hear you smiling when you heard they hit the wall
But I just let it ride so I don't be the next to fall
"They sayin' Terrion been getting money while I'm gone
And won't he tryna to holla at my bitch when I was home"
"Nah, he selling cars, it'd be him and Lil Rome"
I'm just tryna offset what he was saying on my phone
Nowadays niggas don't need shovels to bury you
Pointing fingers like pallbearers how they carry you
So much for death before dishonor
Might as well have a robe and gavel like your honor
I just sit and wonder, play it by the numbers
When you ride like lightning then you crash like thunder
Seen your baby mama, she ain't even know if she should speak
What the fuck is there to say knowing her king's now weak saying...

Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
Well, the walls are talking to me and I know you think I'm wrong
But sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!

Let's talk real niggas, let's speak real, nigga
How many niggas you knew snitching you ain't killed, nigga?
Covered his own tracks, he didn't care that
We had a legacy he killed, I got to wear that
Every move we ever made is getting stared at
I bet the man inside his mirror doesn't stare back
Break your heart when the man you call your brother
Be the same one that setting in motion all them undercovers
Called my mom mother, was at my graduation
When I signed my record deal you was my motivation
Uh, from great friends now it's no affiliation
Divided by the time he was facing, once he told me that...

Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
Well, the walls are talking to me and I know you think I'm wrong
But sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!
Yeah... I just ordered one, my nigga
Yeah...

I’m still a snow mover, blow harder than tuba
Designated shooters, turn weed to woolers
Condo in Atlanta, money counters like the NASDAQ
In that glass back, the motor is the ass crack
I’m still feeding divas like I feed the meter
Holy father to 'em, I ain’t talking Jesus neither
Balance on the scale, I ain’t a Libra either
I’m just a name and a number with the means to reach ya
Grim Reaper, him cheaper, hemp chiefer
His army, MCM on gym sneakers
You knowin' that hymn better, he been preaching
You motherfuckers is bloodsuckers, you been leeching
Been Baller, been Jacob, been dealer
Been realer, pound sign, been trilla
All killer, no filler, been iller
Fraud niggas, you Zoolander, Ben Stiller

When it comes to shooters, my niggas is trained to go
And they gettin' practice on bitches who breaking codes
Thirty-five hundred, just point and give 'em a name
They back flipping niggas, that go for rappers the same
You don't know me, nigga, fuck out my way

Between a renter and a homeowner
Hip Hop Weekly cover and a Rolling Stoner
Lufthansa I heist, nigga, or that bitch Winona
Stop comparing me to rappers 'cause they in their moment
Might have crossed the name brand every blue
But these brand names to a brand owner isn't new
Don't make us equal 'cause we shared a bitch or two
She ain't the angel that you think, she reincarnated too
I build mine off fed time and dope lines
You caught steam off headlines and co-signs
Young niggas cliquing up with my rivals
Like the Bible don't burn, like these bullets don't spiral
Like I can't see the scenes that you mirror in your idol
But a pawn’s only purpose is completely suicidal
Ooh! Suicide, it's a suicide
I'm just talking to the world like it's you and I

When it comes to shooters, my niggas is trained to go
And they gettin' practice on bitches who breaking codes
Thirty-five hundred, just point and give 'em a name
They back flipping niggas, that go for rappers the same
You don't know me, nigga, fuck out my way

Nothing but cash here, this sweater is cashmere
The roof is a translucent, it's nothing but glass there
The car is a concept, what's next is my last year
My future is bright hot, you never can last here
I'm top five, listen, who hot in the past year?
Five heartbeats and I'm feeling like Flash here
'Cause what I captured is the beast unleashed in the pasture
Story of the sheep and the wolves I unmaster
Fifty in the liquor, unwrapped 'em
Unpacked, powder rise and it falls like Sebastian
Telfair, tailor-made suits hand crafted
Over Bottega Veneta, high tops unfastened
S550 drop top is unimaginable
To my hand drop and then he unattached it
Practice it, niggam brick, break down, break dance
Crab walk, back spin, tanner than my black skin

When it comes to shooters, my niggas is trained to go
And they gettin' practice on bitches who breaking codes
Thirty-five hundred, just point and give 'em a name
They back flipping niggas, that go for rappers the same
You don't know me, nigga, fuck out my way
Boy, you got that six in the morning
You got that thing that'll make a girl feel high
Oh, I say boy, you got me lonely
Just say the words, I'll do anything you want
Boy, let me love you

Uh, I know that you think I'm the one, but who doesn't?
It comes with the territory when you buzzin'
A ball player sold you a dream, ain't do nothing
A couple rappers under your belt, but who's judging?
I ain't trying to guide you, hand on Bible
But Instagram pics show more than side views
Thirty-dollar nude catsuits is not cute
And fifty comments on ass is not fluke
So, no cuffing, no buns in the oven
If my girl call your phone, she's just bluffin'
As long as you and I both know we just fuckin'
If anybody else do ask, we just nothing

Boy, you got that six in the morning
You got that thing that'll make a girl feel high
Oh, I say boy, you got me lonely
Just say the words, I'll do anything you want
Boy, let me love you

Hey mama, come fuck with the shotta
With the Givenchy toppa, shoe Balenciaga
If you act right, I can match you up proper
If it's about a dollar thing, big like Poppa
Introduce your exes to my choppa
Don't listen to your best friend, she don't matter
You know she wanna be you in that vehicle
Riding in see-through V1, V2
Chanel or Celine, however I see you
Christians or Chloe, damn, them C's too
You know I play fair, I'm Daddy Day Care
I know it ain't cheap for you to lay here

Boy, you got that six in the morning
You got that thing that'll make a girl feel high
Oh, I say boy, you got me lonely
Just say the words, I'll do anything you want
Boy, let me love you

Let's get past the nonsense and be honest
All the ones I sponsored clear my conscience
Can't commit the crime without accomplice
We both to blame, let's push the shame behind us
On the DL, pushin' my brother’s CL
Meet you at the spot, you had tint on the TL
It’s only right you shake them phony types
And embrace the kid, like my bracelets did
Uh, I’m from the era where the money come fast
Blow it all 'cause the money don’t last
All them broke niggas lookin' puppy-dog sad
She in that new purse, sayin', "Honey, don’t ask"

Boy, you got that six in the morning
You got that thing that'll make a girl feel high
Oh, I say boy, you got me lonely
Just say the words, I'll do anything you want
Boy, let me love you
This shit I wrote quick
Shit I hate
Broke niggas, that always got something to say
Got some nerve to have an opinion

I don't give a fuck what you say about me
Broke nigga two cents don't matter
Give a fuck what you say about me
Broke bitch two cents don't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, ohh

There's a meaning to the kissin' of the ring
The gods don't mingle with the mortals
Peasants ain't sittin' with the kings
Goliath ain't worried 'bout your sling
And Cassius ain't bothered by your swings
You niggas keep rappin' 'bout your dreams, my reality
50 birds waitin' in the wings
Do it my way, I hit the highway with the batter
So when Kanye go on his hia', it don't matter
Since you talking 'bout me, then let's talk about this money
Let's talk about the cars and why mines shaped funny
Lets' talk about the fact you'll never take nothin' from me
Lets talk about the fact you niggas hate I'm up and runnin'
RG3 nigga, be that
Runnin' through this money and these white women
Spike Lee see that
She gotta have it and I gotta give it
And you do not relate cause you niggas do not live it, no

I don't give a fuck what you say about me
Broke nigga two cents don't matter
Give a fuck what you say about me
Broke bitch two cents don't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, ohh

Attention seekers beware, I will grant wishes
We can take this so much further than your mentions
I can get your eulogy on YouTube for instance
Have the whole world view the body
Since y'all claim I'm Illuminati, tell me why would you try me?
Kennedy, John F., or Bobby
Almost caught Reagan, but they stopped us at the lobby
And that was broad day, so how the fuck you gon' stop me?
You lil' niggas just dirty mine's is Zero Dark Thirty
Mine is night vision, witch huntin', ride for Pac worthy
I'm coke boy leanin' on you niggas
If money talk then I must be screamin' on you niggas
Top of the pile I was two thirds away
I was sidetracked busy selling two birds a day, God
Death is just a U-turn away
Two men ten paces then you turn and spray

I don't give a fuck what you say about me
Broke nigga two cents don't matter
Give a fuck what you say about me
Broke bitch two cents don't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, ohh
I don't give a fuck what you say about me
Broke nigga two cents don't matter
Give a fuck what you say about me
Broke bitch two cents don't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, ohh

Entrepreneur, strip club connoisseur
Hot fudge sundae, pour it on you, hallelujah
Pour it on you, hallelujah, pour it on you, hallelujah
And I be on my own dick, ain't that much room for you, ah
Red, white, blue, I pledge allegiance to the street life
Even if it's leftovers, I still gotta eat, right?
Got gas in my peace pipe, pink Sprite
She P-popping her jeans tight
All day I dream about sex, three stripes
We the type of crew to get fresh just to sit in the living room
Look out the window, got a bad bitch in my swimming pool
Got a bad bitch in my swimming pool
Got a bad bitch in my swimming pool
We the type of crew to get fresh just to sit in the living room
Look out the window, got a bad bitch in my swimming pool

They said be all you can be

Pretty girls is my reputation
One on my arm, that's decoration
Getting to it, no hesitation
To fuck with me you need a reservation
To the top escalating, elevating
Good music legislation, delegatin'
And I mean that shit like exclamation, exclamation, exclamation
And I'm going 'til I K.O., eyes closed, I'm OK
All my bitches know they roll, even when we role-play
My homie got that nine on him
All night and all day and all night and all day
And all night like that shit's his motherfuckin' soulmate
'Cause no time for hand in hand
When you got this paper hand in hand-hand
Bitch, I'm feeling like a grown ass lil' boy, nigga, na-na, na-na, na
Bitch, I'm feeling like a grown ass lil' boy
'Cause I still love to get pampered
But don't get it twisted, watch your step and fuckin' manners

They said the truth set you free!

Woooh! They said be all you can be
Woooh! They said be all you can be
I just wanna buy another Rollie
I just wanna pop another band

Always knew I could rule the world
Let's define what my world is
Knee-deep in this dope money
Damn near where my world ends
Yeah, I'm on the move, I can-can't look back (No way)
Screaming, "No regrets, no regrets at all"
Wasting time, I can't get that back
Uh, so everyday I go hard
Real nigga and all my niggas real niggas
Came from making real figures (Too much money)
Nothing less, no regrets (Let's get it)
No-no, no regrets, ahhh...

Say hi to the bad guy, say ahhh to the champagne
Got a call from my jail niggas, said I'm doing my damn thing
(Woo!) They see I'm doing my damn thing
Magazines, videos, they ain't missing a damn thing
Nowadays I sell hope, what you rather I sell dope?
What I sell is a lifestyle, naked bitches on sailboats
Foreign cars on a freight train for every nigga they railroad
Rent-a-cars we road run, money longer than train smoke
I done been in that same boat, I ain't letting this chain go
Representing my niggas down 'til they free 'em like Django
It's the same old, just the same old
How the game go, where the pain go, where the blame go?
My mind wanders on a PJ, my momma brought up in the PJs
In the club sippin' P&J on the same arm as my Piaget (Woo!)
If I leave today, throw the keys away
But I'mma live today, I wanna see tomorrow, I wanna lead the way

Yeah, I'm on the move, I can-can't look back (No way)
Screaming, "No regrets, no regrets at all"
Wasting time, I can't get that back
Uh, so everyday I go hard
Real nigga and all my niggas real niggas
Came from making real figures (Too much money)
Nothing less, no regrets (Let's get it)
No-no, no regrets, ahhh...

Momma had me in the ghetto, I was raised in the slums
Every hero got theme music, guess I need me some drums
Bought me a 5 for 50, I bust 'em down, it was jumps
Trying to be fresh as forces, I swear they white as new ones
Streets taught us, streets raised us, had it less determined
Dodging jackers, dodging murders, federal to state pen
Uncle got power, now I see him in another ten
We was set up just to lose, Lord know we trying to win
In the pursuit of this power, this masterpiece to the hour
You know it's platinum and waterproof, wear this bitch in the shower
Yeah, we want finer things, plus a plug in the scale
Yeah, them plates shining like diamond rings at back, can't you tell?
In the hood, I'm a king, King Arthur to the people
Except he got his on a Chariot, I got mine in a Regal
Sport cars, Italian leather, Princess Cut with baguettes
Law of physics say them 9s weigh more when they wet
No regrets

Yeah, I'm on the move, I can-can't look back (No way)
Screaming, "No regrets, no regrets at all"
Wasting time, I can't get that back
Uh, so everyday I go hard
Real nigga and all my niggas real niggas
Came from making real figures (Too much money)
Nothing less, no regrets (Let's get it)
No-no, no regrets, ahhh...

Presidential, I came back, April showers, I rains back
Jumped ahead like June something, still I'm wheeling that Maybach
Time forward, my braids back, Tom Ford and my shades black
Dope boy with a cape on, super-sizing that beige back
All white like Gotti said, Ye told me I'm outta here
Mentioned Ye two years ago, yeah, I got that by the square (Woo!)
And you could buy a pair, twenty or more and we'll fly 'em there
How you acting like I'm ain't here? D-Boy and I pioneer

Yeah, I'm on the move, I can-can't look back (No way)
Screaming, "No regrets, no regrets at all"
Wasting time, I can't get that back
Uh, so everyday I go hard

Crutches, crosses, caskets
Crutches, crosses, caskets
All I see is victims
My young niggas sic' ‘em
I don’t get ‘em
I just get back their jewelry if I’m fuckin’ with ‘em
Your man crush Mondays be owin’ niggas
My skin is triple black, I’m the omen
You can’t kill a God like the Romans, uh
Take my time to craft shit
‘Cause I don’t like back and forths with Puff about rap shit

Crutches, crosses, caskets
Crutches, crosses, caskets
All I see is victims
Rappers is victimized at an all-time high
But not I, you pop niggas thought I let it fly
I’m Yasiel Puig, I’m in another league
I defected, only thing we have in common, niggas bleed
In ya thousand dollar joggers as you rhyme about ya dollars
Is there shame when a platinum rapper’s mother lives in squalor?
Mildred’s in the Bahamas for the month
She’s probably sitting in her pajamas having lunch
Swordfish, my reality is more fish
Banana clips for all you Curious Georges
Old niggas slapping young niggas
Ha Imagine that, where you from nigga?

Crutches, crosses, caskets
Crutches, crosses, caskets
All I see is death by the masses
The only asterisk is the change of address
My infinity pool as long as Magic’s
Yeah I let Zillow change my pillows
The home is so inviting, the Porsche is the armadillo
The silhouette
The pop, pop, pop; the chop, chop, chop
The throwaway TEC's got Tourettes 
It’s more than this drug money, I love money
I speak to your soul and that’s above money
This the ministry of street energy 
The church of criminology, teaching my chemistries
Woo I’m the L. Ron Hubbard of the cupboard
To some certain motherfuckers gotta love it

Crutches, crosses, caskets
Crutches, crosses, caskets
All I see is victims
Crutches, crosses, caskets
Crutches, crosses, caskets
All I see is victims
Espera, ven aquí, who you wanna be? Drug Dealer? Demon? Rap nigga? You tryna save the culture? Ay Dios mío. You gotta pick one, daddy

Leave your conscience at the door
We done hid the monsters in the floor
I speak to the trap lords
And niggas wit their hands in the white like blackboards
I done been black balled 
And never gave a fuck ‘cause I’m Jack Frost
Of sellin’ that blast off
I’m on a crash course
Where talent meets timing
Christopher Wallace, Think Big, keep climbing
Reasonable doubt, drug era, keep climbing
I’m my brother’s keeper, Lord Willin’, keep grindin’
As a God amongst men
Rinsed drug money, I done paid for my sins
Books and the lawyers, I done paid for my friends
Still held back, I done paid with my skin
The only thing missing is a cape on me
You niggas wanna tag a late, great on me
Put the fears in my peers, heard my footsteps coming from the rear
Now it’s murder was the case homie
I’m watching this three ring circus 
Old lions don’t roar, so the clowns ain’t nervous
Even you fools serve purpose 
Let ‘em run amuck until the king resurface
Then it’s off with your heads
Wear your little jewels, you could floss when you’re dead
They take samples of ‘em, I make examples of ‘em
It’s the thrill of the hunt, I keep my mantle covered
Ask ‘Ye who’s loyalty more realer
Ask P, who’s core’s a drug dealer
Me and Tim, it's coming, it’s gonna kill ‘em
The only great I ain’t made better was J. Dilla
Now we breaking new ground
Get ready for the placing of the crown
King Push nigga!

A Pablito le dieron pa’ bajo, but I’m still here, y el otro tipo? he’s running, but I’m still here, I don’t even know why you doing this loco, yo ni se pa' que, but always still right here. You wanna be like them, don’t you huh? you’re not like them… Y definitivamente, they’re not like us
I let you into my diary to admire me
The make up of this man, I let you see the higher me
The self righteous drug dealer dichotomy
I'm drawing from both sides, I am Siamese
The tug of war opens the door, entrada
Rip me apart and see what's inside of this piñata
And rolling kilos in Gymstrada that's one saga
One chapter of black magic, I'm Harold Potter
Feels like I'm doomed to dealing with women who
Relationships with their fathers won't allow us to bloom
And blossom, I swear them Vegas nights was fucking awesome
But adiós I blow my own dice before I toss 'em
Lost some niggas some other niggas double crossed 'em
Tryna snatch my niggas back I blew a small fortune
Wrestle with the work, we was like the four horsemen
Rick Flair with the flame, I'm motherfucking Gorgeous
As the gull wing doors lift
Karate Kid, crane kick, no Jaden Smith
Whiter than that coke brush that they paint me with
Sunk leather seats softer than an angel's kiss
But they devil red, tires double tread
I post and parks up, that gets me double head
Tight rope walking tryna keep a level head
The bright lights blind look at what the devil did

She left the door open gave a fuck if I'm famous
I write this alone in Vegas
Came off fly street money partied nights with the a-list
I write this alone in Vegas
Remember nights when my team blew it all on the tables
I write this alone in Vegas
I'm the only one left and the memories fading so
I write this alone in Vegas

They'll do everything in their power
Stomp near the stove when you're rising like flour
Make your cake fall when you threatening their tower
It's 911 you're on your 25th hour
Hasta la vista I'm steppin' out the bleachers
How the tide turns when the pupil's now the teacher
The game can't grow by just followin' the leaders
You gotta be better than the ones who precede, yeah
Upgrade them, upstage them
Change the whole body shape and just update them, Pagans
Reagan era I ran contraband
Money caused turf wars through the promised land
First time being rich could be a common man
The Guy Fishers had the blueprints and diagrams
We just took what we needed and we built on it
Lord forgive me for the blood that I spilt on it

She left the door open gave a fuck if I'm famous
I write this alone in Vegas
Came off fly street money partied nights with the a-list
I write this alone in Vegas
Remember nights when my team blew it all on the tables
I write this alone in Vegas
I'm the only one left and the memories fading so
I write this alone in Vegas

Fear of God niggas, got me feelin' like Pac
This the realest shit I ever wrote
Who you know sit in New York for 2 days around Grammy winners
Come back home straight to the money getters
About $14,000 dollars worth in 20s
Brown paper bag money, I call that a good weekend
Re-up gang forever
Long live the caine coming soon
Malice my brother I love you
Liva Don 'til the end nigga
Re-up gang, G.O.O.D. Music, Def Jam
I love my family

The nerve of you
He’ll sit and clip at your lines like he ain’t heard of you
I seen it happen before, that man will murder you
The lowest form of a thief is a cat burglar
Tiptoe-in' but the whole while cloning
The elephant’s in the room, the bitch glowing
Like a ghetto girl with the good weave sewn in
She walk like its her's but the whole world knowing
Told niggas it’s the new god flow
It’s that New Testament and the old God knows
And you new niggas don’t get to pass go
I’ll monopolize Boardwalk Empire flow
So don’t mention me in the same breath, I’m Genghis
Just venting I never wished to be famous
Truth told I’d much rather be strangers
Before it leads to me turnin’ niggas to angels
Local niggas hatin’ but I can’t blame ‘em
Clear the road to the riches but I can’t pave ‘em
Put Trey up on your hook, still couldn’t save ‘em
Better chance with a snowball hitting Satan
Dreams money can buy, three racks just spent on my Marty McFly's
Now I’m back to the future, my career deja-vu you
When you muthafuckers thought I would hardly survive

Don't fuck with me
You see
There's a lot of people out there to be fucked with
I am not one
Re-Up Gang
Don't fuck with me

Rappers on their sophomores, actin' like they boss lords
Fame such a funny thing for sure
When niggas start believing all them encores
I’m just the one to send you off, bonjour
See yourself as I pull up in that mirror tint
Skins vs. blouses, you mirror Prince
Chappelle Show, all of you Neal Brennans
Sketch comedy, who was for real pennin'?
The talk don’t match the leather
The swag don’t match the sweaters
And wolves don’t walk with shepherds
These Margiela verses all you mall dwellers
Off-the-rack suits looking like pallbearers
Coffins for my old bitches’ orphans
Daddy’s MIA like a dolphin
Play the Fendi bucket like a shark's fin
Cool J-ing on you bitches but I’m dark-skinned
We walked in, seats courtside
Dap Diddy, Will Ferrell on my walk by
At the US Open, there’s much more to Queens
Versace blu-blockers, row behind Oracene
Dreams money can buy
Three racks just spent on my Marty McFly's
Now I’m back to the future, my career deja-vu you
When you muthafuckers thought I would hardly survive

Push..no shots...but nothing goes unseen
It's coming clear I've noticed
It's a different face you're showing
It's another "welcome back"
I don't imagine it could be this way, so jealous
Only you can tell it tell me why
Only you can tell it, only you can say
Only you can tell it
Only you can say
Only you can tell it
Tell me why

Two sides, what the game'll do
Bring money, fame to you
Stackin' mine, nigga ye high
Standin' on it like a pedestal
Couldn't imagine a better view
From the poolhouse you see four cars
Bad bitches, they skinny dippin'
Mixed college bitches with porn stars
Disconnected my OnStar, no GPS these VVS
Lorraine Schwartz on speed dial, one ocular, that's CBS
Aston Martin, DBS, James Bond cool as James Todd
Best nigga to make hits and run base since A-Rod
Hands dirty like Ason, I'm grindin' nigga you J Kwon
My Diors is distressed, CDG vest with Jays on
Bloggers get your trace on, 500 horses race on
Coke ties, that coke dries, it's cemented, it's baked on
Eghck! That's based on, the life of a nigga who ain't said nothin'
Trunk tight, trunk white, can't relate if you ain't bled nothin'
Now that there said somethin', don't make me have to dead nothin'
You askin' me to tell you why you niggas never had nothin'


Folarin back, the hardest out I put us on the map
My eyes low, I keep 5 rolled so my THC be makin' sound effects
We ain't hatin', cause we ain't y'all, too much Ciroc we CB4
62, black on black, see my vehicle is like MEAC ball
Shoutout to Norfolk, kicks from Portland, my hoes from Portsmouth
Y'all nick and dime, if a brick was 'round you might need a forklift
Can't fuck with us cause me and my niggas ride
That's right, what up Pusha T, it's DMV for life
Giuseppe Zanotti, I beg your pardon, respiratory full of Nesta Marley
Three something for an after party and Balenciaga, I filled Arenas twice
Tell these motherfuckers get me doe
Iceberg Shorty, mu' fuck your Disney store
And remove your words, G double O-D, MMG we good
Got Zamunda furs, don't know how Akeem, but Pusha's semi cold
My nigga Geezy out in VA, I hope you hear these flows
Behind these walls, still in our thoughts, the city know
In the midst of negativity
A positive sight can be blurred
And the visions that we thought were good
Seems to let evil occur
While still possessing our human form
We live life searching for greatness since the day we was born
And as we bow our heads at night, rich, wealthy
Or poor with dislike, we pray, asking for
Forgiveness for our sinful ways
With mind, body, spirit and faith, we pray
Amen

Yeah (amen) you like that right? (amen)
I wrote it myself by the way (amen)
Yo Young, Jeezy, Jizzle, Snowman (amen, amen)
We gotta give the streets what they want, man (amen)
Fuck the goddamn shit (amen)
You gotta get it in, bruh, let's get it (amen)

You like that don’t you? I wrote it myself by the way
And I don’t mean to be selfish
But I picture myself getting paid
And you might catch pneumonia
'Cause I'm colder than a elf on a sleigh
Me and Pusha back on it
Now everybody help us pray
Lord forgive my sins and all my friends
Dollars make sense, I’m trying to get paid

Trying to get saved (too late!) time to get paid
Got a gun and a stocking mask
Niggas thought I was trying to get waves
I’mma let all ya’ll niggas pray for it
My young niggas knocking off a K for it
Sold my soul on the back-end
Only fucking way I’mma pay for it
Front that shit, you put a flame on
My niggas locked in a cage for
They keep telling me to go hard
#1 spot you was made for
Yuugh! I made more
Front of the grill, got a racehorse
California Crayola red
"Glow In The Dark" like a Ye tour
Fuck niggas stepping in my lane for
Not knowing that it’s a land mine
Soon as a nigga feels a cool breeze
Throw the top up like a gang sign
Red or blue, Crip or Blood
Solitaires, diamond studs
Like chandeliers I’mma flood
Black Jesus piece like it’s dipped in mud
Fashion gods, notice mine
Rollerball spikes, I’m Pokémon
Paris shit, Louboutin
Under bright lights, where do you belong?

Please Lord, yeah, it’s gettin realer everyday
Niggas killin’, niggas starving, niggas they can’t find no yay
See at first they roll around and their bills they cannot pay
So some be trappin', some be dyin', bow our heads and let us pray
Amen

Amen, how many people do you know hatin’?
On your downfall sitting their waitin’
When you shine, don't know what they gonna say then
Everything I do now stadiums
So tell me what they really gon’ say to him
And I’m headed straight to the ATM
Finna go HAM, nigga finna go in
Nigga you'll get it when pigs fly
When Yeezy fake, Devil’s pie
Piece of cake, Kit-Kat

Jesus Christ, club like a broken neck

In Egypt they fightin’ for freedom
Cop pull you over for no reason, beat him

Niggas killin’, niggas starving, niggas they can’t find no yay
See at first they roll around and their bills they cannot pay

I got them units packed in that black van like the A-Team
Even seen them come 2-tone like a saleen (saleen?)
Saleen, yeah that’s a Mustang
Break ‘em down in the night, that's what I call hustling
They say they want that dumb shit, well this is ignorant
Condo on the timepiece, yeah now that's ignorant
They like, "Young, you a fool", yeah I coulda bought some real estate
Instead I bought a half a block and tried to sew up half the streets
I’m on 75-75, when they was going for the 25
Guess who’s pickin’ up a trey? Just an ordinary day
With extraodinary pay, extraordinary risk
Can’t even explain, got an extraordinary wrist
I talk it cause I lived it man, this shit ain't really nothin' to me
Tell ya like Sosa told Tony, “Don't you fuck with me”

Please Lord, help, it’s gettin realer everyday

King Push
RZA
Razor
Execution

The devil is a lie
You ain't broke bread 'till you taste the devil's pie
They say his laugh sounds like an angel when he cries
What better camouflage when the halo's your disguise
Them wings don't fly; your traitor is your neighbor
At your front porch, and he's handing you your paper
Bathrobe on, but the sword's underneath
And he wanna see your blood as it pours in the street
It's the mark of the beast
The meek shall inherit the Earth; the weak shall inherit the dirt
You each should have perished at birth, stillborn or aborted
Every street tax gotta come with an audit
Either your life, or your loved ones, straight razor or a snub-gun
From the village where the thugs from
Same corner that you copping all your drugs from
He a hero, but he unsung, I'm the one

Ayo homie, the chambers is 36, they new and improved
Now make a move, these guns whistle, sizzle up dudes
Who got big mouths, no power
Run in the bank with no dollars, got the nerve to switch crews
We better than the rest of 'em, my guess is the estrogen
And all the money we got, we move like the Mexicans
A cartel, compound, a carvel, a large scale in Scarsdale
I fuck with golf now, Shallah is ill
Yeah, the coke is fresh, straight out of Bermuda yo
Or chilling on a beach in Boca Chica
With tuna salads and palaces, yo, we smoke out them chalices
Passing of the balances of bread to the Island since
1984, the blow was just more
Then we would come trough with rifles rockin Nike boots and war
A real nigga's invention that came from a henchman
Who blew up, now throw the Wu up, that's my redemption

Drug dealer, been that nigga half my life
Drug dealer, been that nigga half my life
You niggas talking, but you ain't never seen 'em
Imagine being first name basis with the kingpin

God, I was Lucifer's neighbor
You wouldn't believe some of the things these people do for this paper
Moving with lasers under Rugers
Make a move, you make the papers, lose lose situation
Sweat or blood, you get to choose what you bathe in
The chemists cookwork, the runners; footwork
The custies took work, the soldiers put work in
On any of the motherfuckers who fucked up good work
Bosses tell 'em: 'Good work,' that's just how the hood work
Northface bubble with eight bundles under it
Gold front upper-lip smile while I was hugging it
I lied, I wasn't Lucifer's neighbor, he who I'm fucking with
My moms threw that snow in her nose, but I would hustle it
Champ hoodie, Mongoose with the pegs
Clap your stoop up, hit moms duke in her legs
That's beef nigga, y'all ain't street niggas
Y'all peep niggas, write it down and try to be niggas
Fucking everything, neck heavy swing
Second-hand swept across that pretty Breitling
In that Nissan, Honda, Chevy thing peddling
Whatever bring 'fetti in, steadily I fed my whole team

Drug dealer, been that nigga half my life
Drug dealer, been that nigga half my life
You niggas talking, but you ain't never seen 'em
Imagine being first name basis with the kingpin

In this art of war, my pen stroke is Picasso
Niggas get the picture I ain't got to paint the nostrils
You know my origins is over when
Fat black bitches singing over organs
Die for a dollar, pride you don't swallow
You save that for the one you buying red bottoms
Yuugh! That's the price you gotta pay for it
All's fair in love and war, she masquerade for it
Woo! Jack-O-Lantern Push
Trick or treat, fuck your shit, I earned it off the books
Now listen to me vent
When you sitting watch, it's like the tires being spent
Shots from everywhere, but they never make a dent
Knight in shining armor
Mistake me for the villain cause my vengeance is your karma
Yeah, fear is knowing you're a goner
This music to my soul, cause it's death before dishonor
Gone

Check! Got the tongue of a pimp, raised by a dirty preacher
That used the church money to cop a new Beamer
Got the heart of a child raised by a prostitute
That bought his momma the rubbers when a John came through
It’s the microphone methadone, greatest ever etched in stone
You ain’t getting pussy like your prom date had a chaperone
Popping pills got a nigga brain like a labyrinth
Called the ho on purpose but I got the brain on accident
Nigga I’m your majesty, show up with a bag of weed
Rolled a blunt so perfect, thought it came up out a factory
My manuscript leave a man ripped of all his dreams
The insomniac with nightmares in sixteens
I’m a wet dream, dry sense of humor
Travel in class like a high school rumor
No one really cares if you embarrass us with style
Cause when it comes to them raps you been letting us down
So tell em why you're mad son
Gotta get it off your chest, let em know how you feel son
You gotta say what you say
It don’t matter, they gonna say a nigga hating anyway
I say hey, sunshine
Oh how the day can be so long
I say hey, sunshine
Oh how the day can be so long

America, you need a miracle
Beyond spiritual 
I need a realer view
I hold a mirror to it
These ain’t new problems, they just old ways
I see one time turn sunshine into Freddie Gray
Just another nigga dead, just another nigga dead
Send another to the FEDs, send another to the FEDs
Not guilty, still I’m filthy
In FOX eyes, we the dark side
So they tell you lies
Through a TV, C-N-B-C
C-N-N, Don Lemon, no Kweli when you meet me
In order to be me
You gotta see what Chief Keef see
Brenda’s baby next door to the candy lady 
Same project as Candy Man where they still doing hand-in-hands
Sunday to Sunday, pastor only want one day
Grandma praying someday
But God can’t hear it over gun play 
Woo! Still a target, but the badge is the new noose
Yeah, we all see it, but cellphones ain’t enough proof
So we still lose

I say hey, sunshine
Oh how the day can be so long
I say hey, sunshine
Oh how the day can be so long

I don’t got no march in me, I can’t turn the other cheek
While they testing your patience, they just testing my reach
Funeral flowers, every 28 hours
Being laid over ours
Sworn to protect and serve, but who really got the power?
Looking over their allowances 
Building prisons where the mountains is
Laptops is for the county kids
Metal detectors is where ours is
They’ll never re-write this, like they re-wrote history
The fact that the Statue of Liberty was black is a goddamn mystery
And so it goes, every truth don’t get told
All these cops get cleared, and lives are stole
Every goose don’t lay gold whoa
Just another nigga dead, just another nigga dead
Send another to the FEDs, send another to the FEDs
They call in the National Guard
Public Enemy, I am Chuck D
Flavor Flav in Louis V, but I’m Huey P
Woo! The new elite, it’s either you or me
Let the sunshine, cause their dark clouds try to ruin me

It’s more and more and more than Baltimore
From shore to shore, oh lord
Patience torn, patience gone, oh lord

I say hey, sunshine
Oh how the day can be so long
I say hey, sunshine
Oh how the day can be so long
Malice found religion, Tony found prison
I’m just tryna find my way out this fucking kitchen
A birds eye view got me channelling my vision
Turn one to two now the kilo’s got a sibling
Father knows best, wash my hands all's forgiven
We kicking up dust like the colosseum floors
Walls full of safes like they mausoleum doors
Pussy getting wet as she walking through my morgue
Grants, Jacksons, no room for George
Yeh, the fear of God’s in you muthafuckas
This art imitate my life
Your World Star Hip Hop fame based off imitation white
Eliminate the fool's gold and imitation ice
My music for your soul, inspiration for your life
Every dime I made in this life wasn't disastrous
Help my young bitch see my way through the Bachelors
Sent my old bitch right back to get her Masters
Same graduation I was clapping in the rafters
The truth hurts everytime it’s revealed
What goes around comes around, this is life's ferris wheel
Grab hold and reverse the steering wheel
As I parrallel park, Kentucky Derby on the grill
The fact that I’m free lets me know God is great
Ten year marathon of me selling concentrate
These rappers talk crowns but I’d rather talk fear
Villain like Candyman, say my name and I’ll appear
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Hakuna matata, feet up sipping java
Strolling up the totem poll, what’s my only problem?
Scrolling through my Rolodex, who shall bear my toddler
So many hands raised as the band plays
I’m here now, watch how many nigga's plans change
First class flights, Ciroc soaked nights
Waking up to models, what a motherfuckin life
Work, hard work (Grrrrrrrrrrah!)
Work, hard work (Git!)
Hard work (Git! Git!)
Work, hard work (Grrrrrrrah!)

Grrrrrrrrrah!
I can’t be bothered with paying homage to forefathers
See the future like the car show floor models
Both feet in the snow, so that my core follows
We don’t mourn for the dead nigga, we pour bottles
Drown sorrows, ocean blue Murcielagos
Started with similac powder in a baby bottle
The formula is warning ya
Crack kills offerings to the coroner
Kill my eldest brother? Nigga, I’ll be damned
Gator at my momma’s house, welcome to zombie land
A hustler’s paradise, a lucky pair of dice
Down 40 but a streak will have you square by night
Didn't bat an eye I at it, kept the poker face
Cause the batter I add had the coca base
When you get to heaven’s door they won’t hold a space
If you numb like the flesh on a smoker’s face
There’s no feeling like your bitch chin chilling right
You in Italian leather and you're four wheeling right
You know you’re up when you count a quarter mil in white
And if you down you can slang it like a pillow fight
I’m a wizard at it, nigga here’s the magic
Make a small town feel like I throw a blizzard at it
Get the green from the scale like a lizard had it
Bear witness as I unveil this instant classic

Yes! My God!

The Second Coming is in the second verse
The first coming still here, so I’ll need a hearse
I got a voodoo doll every time I pen a verse
Not only do they say they feel it but say it hurts
No pain, no gain, nigga
They say I’m heating up, welcome to the flame, nigga
No matter the success, still the same nigga
I only change when the new body came, nigga
Aerodynamic, roof panoramic
My credit score let the dealer take full advantage
Paid over sticker price, cash under handed
The 012 a year early, I’m a time bandit
Gotta time manage when you heaving snow
Able to drop it all at 30 and be free to go
Only deal with divas on a need to know
And what you need to know is when you need to go
They’ll be no waiting, I have no patience
This is the end for all my unrecognized greatness
I’m here now, nigga, pardon my lateness
You can hear in every bar and every cadence
It’s the new god flow, ain’t it
The last supper for you niggas now repainted
Take position on the chess board and rearrange it
Face to face with the truth, get reacquainted
EarDrummers
Mike WiLL Made-It

Half a year later, still ain't heard an album greater (yo)
The natives want me out of the office, back on the pavement (yo)
Jokers at the top know the king is nothin' to play with (yo)
9 to 5 money is just as sweet as the grave shift (yo)
El presidenté, Blobama, blow by ya
Chopper next to me in every picture, Osama
Oh mama, they question my starting line up
You only find a diamond from diggin' like coal miners
Don't listen to 'em, Desiigner
The same rappers talkin' next year will be Uber drivers (Fuck 'em)
Chanel dad hats, but you don't know that they got 'em
Trap door shopper, they rotate the wall
So you will never see me as you rotate the mall
330 spin, cook a steak up on this grill
Me myself and I, we like a hamster in the wheel
Rolls emblem, Black Virginian
Pull in a neighborhood I don't blend in
Album of the year contender every year
The kitchen's full of work, it's blenders everywhere
Blended bitches everywhere that do the most
They never seen with him so they fuck his ghost
Invisible man, timepiece with the invisible hands
MJ, remember the time they counted in sand hourglass
But mine come with purse and heels
And the DIY Gucci with the crest and shields
It's too far gone when the realest ain't real
I walk amongst the clouds so your ceilings ain't real
These niggas Call of Duty cause their killings ain't real
With a questionable pen so the feelin' ain't real
Rap's John Grisham
I can paint the picture with the words if you listen (shh)
The bar's been lowered, the well's run dry
They beefin' over melodies, but no, not I (yugh)
See I'm so top 5
If they factor in the truth I just might blow by
Blobama
“It's so hard for me to sit back here in this studio, looking at a guy out here, hollering my name! When last year I spent more money, on spilled liquor, in bars from one side of this world to the other, than you made! You’re talking to the Rolex wearing, diamond ring wearing, kiss stealing, whoa! wheelin' dealin', limousine riding, jet flying son of a gun and I'm having a hard time holding these alligators down!”

To all hustlas with the same interest
Bow your heads as the Lord's mentioned
Prayer service held in the kitchen
I wish they never found Jimmy Henchmen
I’m what dreams are made of
Cocaine Ronald gave us
Then Nancy tried to save us
By that time we had Motorola pagers
Now we push button start motors
Yacht owners, you small ballin', that’s Pop Warner
Menage a trois in the bath house
Blew money on ‘em, bitches never bad mouth
You glass slipper bad whores, I just cash out
You open doors, I open jaws and pass out
Luxury is just my lifestyle
I’m Scott free with a million dollar bright smile

You niggas gettin' money, I never hear about it
The bricks fell, I skip jail, live to tell about it
I'm what dreams are made of
I'm what dreams are made of
Sell that pussy to me, I’d rather buy it baby
Look at ya purse you need the help, you can’t deny it baby
I'm what dreams are made of
I'm what dreams are made of

Yeah, Louboutins under sweats
A hundred just landed from responding to a text
Niggas talk money but I’m still unimpressed
When these thousand dollar sneakers got me feeling underdressed
Hip Hop bores me, hustlers applaud me
Too much school boy, not enough rude boy
Nothing match the feeling of pulling up in that new toy
And it ain't even half of my safe, tuck like the Jew boy
Bentley with the rag-top yarmulke
It says kilometers all on my speedometer
Cocaine under my tongue like thermometer
I got the fever, I never took a breather
Need a way out like Nas needed an Ether
Like Mike Vick chased by PETA
More pony hairs, more zebras
More pythons, more lizards

You niggas gettin' money, I never hear about it
The bricks fell, I skip jail, live to tell about it
I’m what dreams are made of
I’m what dreams are made of
Sell that pussy to me, I’d rather buy it baby
Look at ya purse you need the help, you can’t deny it baby
I’m what dreams are made of
I’m what dreams are made of
It's like an itch you can't scratch
It's like a bitch you can't shake
I still wanna

Sleeping with the finest, the thread count is bindless
Security blanket of cocaine, I am Linus
In this climate I’m Kareem Burke tied in
The Roc's silent partner I ain't throwing up the diamond
Throwing on the shearling, collars up, bottles up
Sparkles to the table, got him feeling like he’s Merlin
Whirlwind, powder makes your world spin
Learn from OGs, Alfa Romeos and Sterlings
Updated that, upgraded that
Suffocation blue, in the inside's potato sack
Yeah, talk money, shit, I’m made of that
Cocaine parties like the 70's, I cater that
You know what fame is?
Sitting with the woman of your dreams and forgetting what her name is
You know what pain is?
Flushing two bricks and trying to have a nigga strain it out the drainage

See my face on the news and it ain't Tivo'd
I still wanna sell kilos
It’s like I’m throwing rocks at the Pen begging for the Rico
I still wanna sell kilos
Searching for the fishscale like I’m tryna find Nemo
I still wanna sell kilos
That's what happens when you Michael and they try to treat you like Tito
I still wanna sell kilos

Grew up watching momma car repo'd
A little nigga staring through the peep hole
How you think I felt knowing daddy wasn’t there
Recycling cans cause nobody ever cared
Get it how you live, always echoed in the streets
When we talking business, talking on the phone cease
Feds listening to conversations through my OnStar
Piecing puzzles together solving homicides of I's
Dice game chatter, better bring your stash out
Red velour, I’m in the white glass house
Half a ticket bitches quick to drop it on the scale
City of dope where real nigga sell yay'
Everyday a nigga dies and we can’t ask why
Showing more love to bitches fucked on the side
Tony Montana, tailor made suits in the church
Rolls Royce Corniche, trunk full of work

See my face on the news and it ain't Tivo'd
I still wanna sell kilos
It’s like I’m throwing rocks at the Pen begging for the Rico
I still wanna sell kilos
Searching for the fishscale like I’m tryna find Nemo
I still wanna sell kilos
That's what happens when you Michael and they try to treat you like Tito
I still wanna sell kilos

Testarossa top models, G4s
Gucci pass the crease off, everything I climb in, I win
Richard Mille Tourbillon, remarkable timing
Black label everything, logos in the lining
Bell Biv DeVoe push poison like a copper head
Powder falls, smoke clears through the walking dead
The Rosé bottles pour for the champions
You'd think it was a Grammy win, celebration spills
Through the morning like an Ambien, bitches love my ambience
Chain swinging, ticker taping like it’s Mardi Gras
Thousand niggas deep, never needed body guards
Thousand ki's that I’m about to do Pilates on
Wear the king's crown like the grill a Maserati’s on
Catty corner parked, doors ajar, on a stripper
Blew a fuse and caught a body on, cocaine storaging
Liva living dreams, y'all DeLoreans is pouring in

See my face on the news and it ain't Tivo'd
I still wanna sell kilos
It’s like I’m throwing rocks at the Pen begging for the Rico
I still wanna sell kilos
Searching for the fishscale like I’m tryna find Nemo
I still wanna sell kilos
That's what happens when you Michael and they try to treat you like Tito
I still wanna sell kilos
Yeah, I'm taking niggas' lunch money
Too bad, I was fucking hungry
Real niggas don't notice you
I'm the only dopeboy quotable

Mami tryna land a Sinatra
So she don't fuck niggas with Apple watches
Cause Rolex shopping is more exciting
Shout out to dopeboy lit 16 swipers
Howard homecoming kingpins
Movie on my neck with the screen gems
Me and my nigga havin' bottle wars
40 thousand on the floor when them bottles pour (Spill, nigga)
A Blu Ray to your DVD
You might've caught me on TMZ
Cameo tryna sue a nigga (Fuck 'em)
Cause I party hard like it's three of me
America's still abusing us
And 9/11 is the Ku Klux
So why wouldn't I fire back
When every day them niggas shooting us?
True enough, I'm out of line
You better stand for something 'fore you out of time
This is crime by design
If the crown ain't mine, tell me who am I behind

Yeah, I'm taking niggas' lunch money
Too bad, I was fucking hungry
Real niggas don't notice you
I'm the only dopeboy quotable

Riding 'round with Miguel Cotto in the trunk
What I'm cooking in the kitchen, niggas
Bobby Brown, New Edition, niggas
What I'm wearing in this blizzard, nigga
Mink, leather or it's lizard, nigga
Saint Laurent, I'm in all layers
The mannequin to you ballplayers
Shout out my Mac 11 monster
Grew up on Nintendo playing Contra
And though that nigga only 5'9"
100 bodies on his timeline
What's the price of success?
Lost my bitch, bought a chef
The 911 cost 211
Watch looking like a jeweler's heaven
Hottest 7, I'm so alive
Your bank account Swiss, nigga, so is mine
This is crime by design
If the crown ain't mine, tell me who am I behind

Yeah, I'm taking niggas' lunch money
Too bad, I was fucking hungry
Real niggas don't notice you
I'm the only dopeboy quotable
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
These niggas heads is too light
Put the Fear of God in these niggas, Pusha

It's like the changing of the guards
We changing out the frauds
I gave these lions heart like my name ended in Oz
Long time coming, Sam Cooking up these bars
Still Eddy Caning, see the fiends sunk in jaws (Yiuuck)
Push a ton, pledge allegiance to the raw
Known dope dealer that escaped without a scar (Yess)
I'm Buddy Lee so lucky me, see I’m home
Wish I could jailbreak my team like an iPhone (Wooo)
Squilly told me take this motherfucker by storm
Get the money and they bitches, bring the prize home (Yess)
So as I embark, this where begin start
I write my own happy ending, nigga pen sharp
My life’s a Kodak moment, I need a frame for it
The Penthouse’s bed needs a crane for it
I'm fuckin on it, exotic bitch from out the rainforest
So many bitches it's a blur, I take the blame for it (Wooo)
God in heaven knows what I feel inside
Responsible for all this inner-city genocide
I'll be damned if I let Yale campus vilify
As I uplift this art form ceiling high
I can't identify, with your one death
We lose thousands over here, you speakin' one breath
Outsiders looking in like using one ref
My zip cam point of view to you is one step
Closer to clarity, not a parody
How cocaine single handedly carried me
Escaped clever through the fox hole narrowly
They kick dirt up on my name until they bury me
I just shake it off, then I shake a leg
A lot of time to make up is what Jacob said
The fans fell for your act, I tell you break a leg
Then guns shots going off that’ll awake the dead
Push!
I got some killers so don't push me, Juicy J be on some mob shit
Waiting by your doorstep, hidin' in the bushes (mhmm)
If it comes down to it, ain’t no thang but to do it
Got a vest on, got a gun that can really do it
You niggas playin' with real niggas' money, get fronted
One day you is the plug, next day you’re in the dumpster
Couldn’t keep it one hundred, you’re thirty-two percent
The police got you on a leash, nigga you a bitch

It’s homicide when I slide up on ya
Reporting live from the project benches
Hella caine, dope in cellophane, dirty syringes 
Heron zombies street-walking on three-week binges
Clientele look like the “Thriller” vid in 3D lenses
COD, niggas never had to front me jawns
I’m weighing bricks on the scale they put the lunch meat on
I’m Nino Brown in the projects
Yes, Curtis Jackson in his pyrex
Get rich or die tryin’ is my mindset
And spend it all until I’m swallowing dirt
Cause I ain’t never see a Brinks truck follow a hearse 
I ain’t never see a dead man taking the stand
I ain’t never see a nigga swallow a bullet 
And live to talk about it
'Bout that bread, I drop a coffin 'bout it
You watched me go through hell, now watch me walk up out it
Nigga shit, that’s how I lost three million
Luckily was somethin’ in the ceiling, keep dealin ya
They been trying to tie me to the BALCO
Too many clicks in the dial tone
I’m my city’s Willy Falcon
How you niggas celebrating Alpo?
I’m disgusted
Interior rustic, the mustard-colored wall’s adjusted
Trap doors everywhere
Macs come out the floor, dinners at the Forge
Four Seasons all four seasons
It’s good to have a getaway for no reason
Concierge never speak
‘Cause this week look like last week
They both named Ashley
I might travel to El Barrio
To get it from Daddy-O then adios
Cellphone at the back patio
I didn’t have to make a cameo to get it off

I hope you betting on the sleeper
It all started on a beeper 
Now they asking for the feature
Till I'm steppin' out the bleachers
Drug money kicked around like it’s FIFA

Yuugh! Pops up like dandruff
Beverly Hills Jed Clampett
A shotgun wedding to collect my ransom
Cameo Chris Hansen
I’m at your door
You don’t wanna know him if you owe him
I done boxed in cars and had to tow ‘em
I done laid in lawns when they didn’t mow ‘em
Even hogtied wives, I had to show ‘em
That I mean business
I mean everything I say, no witness
No forgiveness, Souls of Mischief 
It’s on through infinity, my arms are endless
Your arms, too short to box with God
Might send a bitch a Elie Saab
She fucks and robs
10 grand just to touch the job
Close range, she don’t duck and dodge
You can’t trust them odds

I hope you betting on the sleeper
It all started on a beeper 
Now they asking for the feature
Till I'm steppin' out the bleachers
Drug money kicked around like it’s FIFA
I hope you betting on the sleeper
It all started on a beeper 
Now they asking for the feature
Till I'm steppin' out the bleachers
Drug money kicked around like it’s FIFA
I hope you pussy muthafuckas die
Wish death upon they soul until they burnin' in a fire
I'm the illest mothafucka breathin', fuck yo rhyme or yo reason
Fucking over yo issues, it's kill-a-ho-nigga season
I made my way, way, I found my road, road
Bar-arada-da, I made my own, ho
YUGHHH , you ain’t ever have shit local nigga?
Woo, how the fuck I owe you local niggas?
I’m a global nigga, Champs-Élysées shopper
Looked up to Eric B and dope dealer, chain rockers
Where was you when I was bleeding
Disappointed and battling my demons
I just want to ride Italian leather, acting like you don’t know me
Euro designer palace, fuck my bitch on Missoni
And I feel…

And I feel like they want to take my life
Be careful what you say, be careful what you do
Tell them what they want to hear, but stay from the truth
And I feel like they want to take my life

It ain’t enough that I struggle through my career
Less appreciated when I was part of a pair
Pushed an envelope full of truth like I was dared
Depiction and the depth was the proof that I was there
It’s no question in my origins
Photo album full of Polaroids they’re still pointing in
Couple million records sold, still say I’m poisoning
Seven different SIM cards, bringing all that mortar in
Brick by brick nigga, all you add is water in
We ain’t got to touch hands nigga, put your order in
I just want to float through clouds Hermes seams on my towels
No overly gaudy shit, just the diamonds on the dials
Woo, and I’m still buying mo’ guns
Mo’ money, mo’ murder nigga, choose one
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy

Seeing is believin', believe when you see it
They saying I'm the best shit, I'm just trying to be it
They tied me to a mountain of it, I just try to ski it
Long distance wireless Kinect like I Wii it
Double-U double-I, spelled so you can see it
Cause it's way over their heads when I Ray Allen 3 it
I'm Rondo on the bongos when giving you my convo
We ain't been home since we were snatched out the Congo
Toast to progress as I'm staring out my condo
Made it this far and I ain't never been a Tonto
Yuh, as you compare me to a fuckin' rookie
You can't respect the new school when you played hookie
Cooked white, turned it tan, sold world Snooki
School of Hard Knocks, look at where the game took me
To the limit like Montana with better grammar
Bigger homes with bigger guns and better cameras


You are now listening to the future
Open your eyes, nigga, and see what I see
Don't mind me, I'm just here to restore the feeling
Yeah, I'm just here to restore the feeling
You feel the pressure, yeah

I never pitched a penny in a wishing well (Never)
I laid it all on a fishing scale (Yes)
And an apron that hung from a kitchen nail
Straight from my memoirs as I kiss and tell
Big faces like Rushmore, touch more
Fashion trailblazers, trendsetters look to us for
The next mission when the tide dries up
With no innervision yet they eyes wide shut
Fifteen years abducting spies like us
Confidential informants disguised like us
Jail doesn't resonate with guys like us
Told Wesley at the Oscars to slide like us
Didn't listen, so prison is what they did to him
Accountant unscathed, millions is what they hid through him
Same principles you must adhere
Lohans get the breaks, the T.I.'s, we just steer through 'em


The odds is against us
No excuses though, we just play harder
Hustle smarter, yeah
They done freed Weezy
Congratulations my nigga
Now let TIP go, yuh
The flow plays limbo courtesy of Timbo
Strip it down nigga, Jim Joe
I build it better nigga ten fold
La Ferrari from the Enzo
The stencil inspired by Kenzo
The roof is like Ghostface, can it be so simple
40 keys in a rental
My dogs bring it back, now you name a better kennel
I keep cash, case Feds connect me
Case kids kidnap me, kids can get back me
Not concerned with your rap beef
Poetic justice watching you sock puppets
Fuck it, I got my dope boys covered
The Arizona brick is 26 and they love it
Thou shalt not covet what thou cannot budget 
I bury 2 mil in the Caymans they can’t touch it

Fuck it, I got my dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got my dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered
The Arizona brick is 26 and they love it

Trap phone, gun at your backbone
Graduated from the corner where the crack’s thrown
Back talk to your momma now you act grown
Listening to Young Dolph till the pack gone
I relate to ‘em
I’m a Pyrex God, shit I’m great to ‘em
All of you lil’ niggas quote all of the wrong figures
Poke all of the wrong bitches
And follow the wrong niggas
Whichever rapper hot at the moment
Don’t realize he a candle till he blow it
I gave y’all the game it’s decoded
The only thing left is to grow it
Drop a shoe, start a Play Cloths or two
It’s all hustlin’, so deja vu
Still a nigga unwrap bricks
I’ma dye on that money like a bank got hit sniff

Fuck it, I got my dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got my dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered
The Arizona brick is 26 and they love it

Game too emo, I’m too Nino
Must stay low-key, I play Reno
I’m so Pesci, too Casino 
We Sinatra, Sammy, Dinos
Outlandish, so illegal
So Carlito, so Pacino
We sip vino, the grapes of wrath
Money counter go till it breaks in half
Coupes the flagship, it feels like futon
Palm the paddle shift, abuse the redline
The home is ranch style, reflects the poolside
Powder paved the way, the sword got two sides
Duffle a hundred bands, trunk is 2-5
Mules are flying in, the drive from Tucson
The dash is hollowed out, we shortened the fuel line
Connect is in Panama, in bed with the cruise lines

Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered
The Arizona brick is 26 and they love it

Get my chain, get my chain
This G.O.O.D. Music
You're sweet to me diabetes
Peace treaties
Breakfast of champions, they need Wheaties
Carrying the torch, the Olympic four rings
I'm a javelin throw from the crowning of the king
I hear em whisper like a hummingbird sings
Of all the trust issues that a hundred birds bring
Now the wolves out hunting for your bling
You're preying on the bitches with the lowest self esteem
It's a common running theme
Victim or vice lord
Disciple or Black stone, what you look to Christ for
We in the last days, fire or the ice storm
I wear it in my chain as a symbol of a crime lord
Let's be honest, the cards on the table
Jealousy's a sin, Cain killed Abel
Backstabber, Caesar had Brutus
It's hard to weed 'em out, even Jesus had Judas
Gone
Now that you’re focused 
I’m glad that you noticed
The realest nigga here
It’s kinda chilly being the coldest
Me and Timbo in that two-door, making our ”Otis"
Now witness the chosen
It’s just different here
Monte Carlo nights, let her throw the dice
Play in paradise
All I know is white
Get the powder gone
Bitches love to shop, levitate the mall
Mattress full of money, let it break the fall
Woo! She used to fly on a buddy pass
They say when the money go, you hope that your honey last
I been preaching since money, cash— hoes

And I promise, I hardly see you
From where I am it’s so hard to see you
Got money I’ve been different ever since
Maybe it’s me and my arrogance
Who are you, who are you anyway?
Who are you, who are you anyway?
Who are you? We don’t know you
Who are you? We don’t know you

I’m the fire and the base
I’m admired by the greats
This to each and every rap nigga
I look you liars in the face
Cold case, Rolls Wraith 
Big dipper, constellation in the ceiling, see the stars
See the jewelry, all rock, no guitar 
Who you know better with the raw?
Bogota, she like finessing niggas
She gets a Range Rover Sport 
And got seats on the court from the best of niggas
I never bit at that apple
I never lost my El Chapo
I can still grab it, and bag it and capsule 
Covered in white like I walked in the chapel
I’m that cold

And I promise, I hardly see you
From where I am it’s so hard to see you
Got money I’ve been different ever since
Maybe it’s me and my arrogance
Who are you, who are you anyway?
Who are you, who are you anyway?
Who are you? We don’t know you
Who are you? We don’t know you

The last dope dealer
Red leather in a room full of Thrillers
The mamas, they zombies
Chase a nigga for the money, they behind me
Woo, safe look like it got a printer
Ain’t no rappers in that Sprinter
Ain’t no saints, only sinners
What bitch ain’t fucked a winner?
I’m a blue ribbon nigga
Talk down on you two pigeon niggas
Front five or better
Yeah, I got a mountain of it, you could climb forever
I’m only in the company of kings
I made a power move and it’s everything it seems
Before Ye signed me, I was getting out my dreams
Standing on the shoulders of 20 thousand fiends
Every time a nigga wanna try and turn a profit
Folks rush in, three letters try and stop it
F-B-I-R-S-D-E-A
One letter short but still muthafuck the DA
We play by the rules as they try to crack the code
Combination locks to the kilo’s that I hold
Leopard print Louboutins prowling the concrete
Rollerballs come alive just like Jumanji
You know where to find me, Greenhouse a circle of top whores
Mandarin, Gansevoort, any of them top floors
35 large, took it right out the top drawer
Still got a throwaway phone in my sock draw

It’s like raid, spraying on you roaches
The AK is an animal, it is ferocious
A nigga wanna sing, hope he is the dopest
Watch that nigga disappear; hocus pocus
Ring, ring a nigga won't sing
Ring, ring, I keep that bitch clean
Ring, ring a nigga won't sing
'less he is an insomniac he'll die in a dream

You can tell I went to school on a small yellow bus
Never bothered me, strong arm robbery
I went from powdered Jelly donuts to taking them Os
From my high school sweetheart to fucking more hoes
Look I’m all grown up and I dun blown up
Nigga ain't much changed, in fact, things are the same
I’m the definition of shooter, gun of choice the Ruger
You’ll take my word for it or make me do it to ya
I’m a magnet to murder, when I’m in the mood
Get convicted through the forensics when you walk in my shoes
I’m bad news, you niggas know the verdict, I’m filthy
Drop Phantom is milky, white on white
24 inch blades, I'm skatin', red eyes
Smoking that bomb shit, I'm Satan
Nigga, surprise, 50 back on fire
50 back running round this bitch strapped, hitman for hire

It’s like raid, spraying on you roaches
The AK is an animal, it is ferocious
A nigga wanna sing, hope he is the dopest
Watch that nigga disappear; hocus pocus
Ring, ring a nigga won't sing
Ring, ring, I keep that bitch clean
Ring, ring a nigga won't sing
'less he is an insomniac he'll die in a dream

I sit with the liars, duck tape and tiers
Been lost their soul, they just waiting on the fire
Innocent faces with a shit load of priors
Something out of nothing, a team full of MacGyvers
Deep sea dive for the fishscale
Tryna find a better price, man that ship sailed
Take a breath and head back if that shit failed
Drop weight like an anchor then you set sail
Hell freeze over like the watch I put the sleeve over
Engine devil scream when I turn the key over
Pirelli's on the street rolling like a steam roller
Bitches double team when I have my sleepovers
Yeah, Re-Up Gang with the G-Unit
This is tailor-made drug dealer theme music
Test it on your tongue or either watch a fiend do it
I got you hooked and I laugh as you lean to it

It’s like raid, spraying on you roaches
The AK is an animal, it is ferocious
A nigga wanna sing, hope he is the dopest
Watch that nigga disappear; hocus pocus
Ring, ring a nigga won't sing
Ring, ring, I keep that bitch clean
Ring, ring a nigga won't sing
'less he is an insomniac he'll die in a dream
Big up di numba one awtist inna di rap game, Pusha T
Me waa unnu kno seh nuhbody nah fuck wid da bwoy yah in or outta music
Di money nah stop run
Nuhbody nuh ave di lyrics, nuh body nuh ave di style or fashion weh him have
Fi him program sort out differnt from unnu
Unnu a rampin business, caa who?
When him touch mike everybody haffi puddung an run weh

The dead has arisen
My niggas still in prison, though
Til they free, none's forgiven
It's only one mission, it's only one magician
All-Star's in Houston this year, I'm still fishin'
The plug's playground where them hoes play around
Galleria, Mr. Trick Bag when I'm in town
That's the energy I'm missin'
A thousand drug dealers with the cruelest intentions
Vengeance is mine, says the Lord
Throwin' shots at niggas cause I'm bored and they whores (Pussy!)
I'm Kobe goin' for his sixth ring, while that church choir sing
I'mma lean 'til they crown me king of New Orleans
Now everybody so 80's, 90's-inspired
But none of you niggas 80's and 90's rhymin'
You laptop hot, just internet warm
Down-low for downloads don't get caught up in my storm (Don't do it)
Fuck nigga, you just internet porn
Now we don't gotta fake it no more, the line's drawn
I'm too much dope dealer for rap niggas
Too much closer to every trap nigga
I'm just preachin' facts, nigga
I'm more biased to the coke-dealin' Coupe drivers
And bad bitches steered wrong by they loose mamas
It's the wrath of the caine
Preludes the debut, My Name Is My Name

My name is my name!
My name is my name!
Ay yo, they said it's 10 points higher up there
We got to go get that

Lord Father, I don't mean to be a bother
I'm just prayin' you'll protect me on this road
From the rascal alf-alphabet boys
Trackin' choppers in the highway patrol
It ain't right, but it's white and it's right
And I know once I get there that it's sold
Lord Father, I don't mean to be a bother
I'm just prayin' you'll protect me on this road
While I get this dough

One man cowboy, speed limit timid
Chevy Malibu; we graduated from them renteds
Lost 100 large on the last time we sent it
It's only four letters, I ain't worried 'bout a sentence (k-i-l-o)
Travelin' the distance, stayin' off the white line
Alphabet boys out prayin' what they might find
I hate the Carolinas, racial profiler
Say you smokin' marijuanas, fuck you talkin 'bout
My piss is clearer than my mama's, with her church wig on
996 before I get my Big on
Thousand grams, thousand hands, thousand furs, thousand bands
Hundred thousand dollar horse all-star; we stylin' in


You niggas ain't takin' road trips for real
Route 13 with the vacuum seal
Pre-paid Legal on my window shield
The ice cream man's on his Jack & Jill
Moving weight state to state; MACK trucks I deal, MACK trucks I fill
I feel better knowin' that the donor is anonymous
See, my diamond is growin'
Tugboat or car tow, we summertime snowin'
Reasonable Doubt flowin' on your niggas
Been gettin' it since '96 in black AC Vigors
Snub .38 with the matte black trigger
When How Can I Be Down was filled with crack niggas
This track dictates everything I'm supposed to say
So have mercy on this soul that I've thrown away
Although it's cliche the devil had a hold of me
This greedy motherfucker couldn't put the blow away
Bitches blowing kisses and rappers throwing disses
Hoping to land their ass on all top 5 lists
I wish you niggas well, you niggas wish I fail
You gonna make me bear these arms like a Chippendale
Squeeze off on him, leave cross on him
By the time the bodies found there's peat moss on him
I could show all you the ways in which crime pays
My drug ring's a multi-million dollar crime wave
Two ranch homes, both dockside
Get this money back, counter-clockwise
Little bubble on the cut like peroxide
The poison in the car is not carbon monoxide

I ask forgiveness lord, in hopes of getting more
Then beg forgiveness for the same thing he forgave me for
I wasn't crazy poor, see I was lazy more
A thousand kilos cross his lines that you can't ignore
I felt entitled to it, not how the bible do it
My bright eyes exposed to how the hood idols do it
I just took a page, then I took the stage
Then put the face of that Rollie in that diamond cage
I tried to tame the beast, best I could no leash
I stood the test of time, air-tight no leaks
Not a squeak not a peep of a word
I done lived half my life in arms reach of a bird
Have mercy on me, they put curses on me
I could've been six feet or had nurses on me
It was written like these tatted Bible verses on me
I feel the weight upon my shoulders like the church is on me

I am forgiven
You don't do all the shit that I done and make it through and not be forgiven
This is the Wrath of Caine motherfuckers
Let this hold you over
It's just an appetizer
Ha Ha!
My Name is My name coming soon
Re-Up Gang Forever
GOOD Music
Dope boys worldwide
My Name is My Name

You will not be able to stay home, brotha
You will not be able to plug in, turn on and cop out
You will not be able to lose yourself on skag and skip out for beer during commercials
Because the revolution will not be televised

This right here for the number one
Number ones here with your number one
You ain't number one, just another one
Now everybody sayin' that they number one

Ring the alarm, the caterpillar keeps firing
Ohh, we in the war, where butterflies keep dyin' (ahh)

I'm a product of Parker Lewis and Kubiak
If I didn't do this, where in the fuck would you be at?
See there's a difference between us, what I spit hit arenas
You a drip from my penis, I eat lions and sip hyenas
You number one when it come to slaughtering mics
I'm tryna be number one in my son and daughter life
Uhh, all you niggas my little rapper babies
Y'all my children, y'all bit my shit and contracted rabies
Don't you grade me next to these rappers, baby, that's degrading
My style got so many different facets
I switch into so many different passions
I'm skippin' class to be fascinatin'
My pen is like Big Ben, this shit's just a classic waiting
Your favorite rapper come at me, I just decapitate him
I hate congratulating these has-beens who had their highs
These rappers only won their matches because they strategize
I bring Attica to these patterns, and here's my battle cry

Ring the alarm, the caterpillar is firing
Ohh, we in the war, where butterflies keep dyin' (ahh)

This right here for the number one
Number ones here with your number one
You ain't number one, just another one
Now everybody sayin' that they number one
Kid think your number won't quit
Number one song, get your number one chick
Number one fly with your number one kick
When it's all done then your number gon' switch

Hold up, wait a minute
Guess what I'ma never do? Show so much respect to you
That I feel like we're friends, so now we no longer competitors
That could be the death of you
Never let someone who's not as smart as you
Gas you up and tell you somethin' you never knew
Always stay professional, you always gon' make revenue
Don't let people next to you that don't want the best for you
It's completely normal to hold on to a regret or two
I do what I wanna do, they do what I let them do
Everything these niggas be sayin' is a fuckin' lie
It's nothing I can say to you that is realer
Remember when you praisin' the butterfly
Don't you ever disrespect the fuckin' caterpillar

This right here for the number one
Number ones here with your number one
You ain't number one, just another one
Now everybody sayin' that they number one
Kid think your number won't quit
Number one song, get your number one chick
Number one fly with your number one kick
When it's all done then your number gon' switch

You're looking at Attila, the psychopathic killer, the caterpillar
Don't tell me when I'm supposed to rap until
Especially when your favorite rapper ain't even half as ill
A savage still, the track's a banana peel, attack of the silverback gorilla
You're havin' a little trouble fathomin' this is actually happenin'
Like Anderson Silva back when he snapped his shin in half
And then had the shit hangin' by a flap of skin
After he tried to plant the shit back on the mat again
Pad to pen I’m batty like eyelids when they're blinkin' a lot
You copy me, but you're not
You can't be butterflies, my offsprings are just moths
I see that thing I'ma squash it and rip the wings of it off
So ring the alarm, pull the extinguishers off of the wall
Set the sprinklers off like Jada Pinkett and Queen Latifah
'Till the shingles come off the roof we'll shout at the ceiling
Slaughterhouse in the building, middle fingers aloft
Say what I think when I rhyme, in ink-pen I talk
And the language I speak is my mind
Kingpin and Penguin combined
Spit like it's King of the Dot
A singular thought I think of will help you distinguish apart
The frauds from the cream of the crop
(Wait a minute) Hold up like a flashcard
Damn dawg, is that copyin' or payin' homage?
It's sad because dad taught you to rap as a damn toddler
My dad is your grandfather, I'll have to re-hatch on you
Come back as a black wasp, half yellow jacket, you can't swat a
Sasquatch dancing on top of an ant trample it and stomp it
Smash it and stand on it, dammit, I can't stop it
The rap is a vag' and I'm goin' in like a tampon in this bitch
It's a manslaughter
Stampin' out grasshoppers, you can't be no Rap Gods
In fact you're exact opposites, you make a wack song
And can't hold a candle but even Daniel-san whacks off
You jack-offs need to come to grips like a hand job
The boom bap is coming back with an axe to mumble rap
Lumberjack with a hacksaw
Number one, but my pencils are number twos
'Cause that's all I dos with 'em, poop is my pseudonym
On the john like a prostitute when I'm droppin' a deuce
And when I'm producing them lyrical bowel movements
These beats are like my saloons
'Cause these bars always got my stools in 'em
And I don't need Metamucil to loosen 'em
Bitch, shit is real like I pooped Jerusalem
I'm 'bout to go spin another cocoon
Then I'm cuttin' you from your mother's womb
Then I'm flushin' you!
"Cruising down the river; dancing till your feet got numb; cool summer breezes blowing through your hair as you stood gazing down the river in anticipation of the thrill of the dizzying rides at the amusement park—ah, memories of Bob-Lo Island."
All is your world ain’t nothing but a squirrel tryna get a nut. Just jealous of everybody that’s headed out on that Bob-Lo boat. It is the perfect weather and the perfect time to enjoy a few snacks. Aw, man, I wish I was joining you—a little cheese and crackers, a little Cana wine, a little Riunite on ice, some Harvey’s Bristol Cream—but let’s do this, only on Smooth FM. 

Nothing compared to our family trips
My uncle shook hands with a manly grip
All this hand-me-down-shit; I had had an uncanny fit
All the gangstas I had in my family had me anti-bitch
My granddaddy mistress caught the business from my granny fist
That was back ‘fore I was born
Pop told stories ’bout it that would last for hours-long
And as a family, we was just so happy
When him and mama got along on the Bob-Lo boat
Uh, on our way to that black amusement park
Wood rollercoasters, crack sold on plastic scooter cars
Uh, smoking grass at the vintage food court
Broken glass, waiting on you on the swimming pool floor
I came across my identity on the Bob-Lo boat
That’s where I lost my virginity, no condom, though
That’s when paranoia hit me like when superstition does
Left my inhibitions I guess where my supervision was
Parties on the way to the island would be the livest, though
First time big bro hit the bottle was on the Bob-Lo boat
But neither one of us knew that we would both
Grow up and turn to alcoholics, though, the Bob-Lo boat

Hey, hey, hey, lil’ Craig, come here. Aye, hit this, nigga. Nigga, don’t worry ’bout what the fuck it is, just drink!

Yeah yeah, yeah
Some of my better times, I shared with you
I shared with you, yeah
Shit, all of my better days, I shared with you
I shared with you, shit
And now I gotta wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Shit, stuck inside a rat race (fuck)
Rat race (fuck, fuck)
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up again
Stuck inside this rat race (fuck)

Yeah, look
Twist the cap, lift the bottle back, swig it
Dig it, ten-inch rims on my mama’s Civic
Ten-inch woofers in the trunk, to be specific
They bump, rattle the license plate, plus the windows tinted
Don’t even give a fuck that it’s dented, bitch, I’m the man now
I’m rolling, driving it slow as if it’s stolen
Piling up bros like we was clothing on a dresser
Calling up hoes like we was Jodeci, let’s check her
Double D’s like double-deckers, I wanna sex her
But these keys don’t come with game on how to finesse her
Five semesters left until college, I’m under pressure
I’m not a real nigga ’til I undress her, I gotta ‘press her
This was my main concern back when concerns were lesser
Nowadays, I often yearn to press the
Backspace button or hit return but life is not no word processor
Most folks would burn the sess to burn the stress of
My real-life trauma plus fickle niggas thinking they done heard the best of
Jermaine Lamarr but that’s insane, it couldn’t be further left of
The truth is that my new shit slap, you never heard it better
Give me a sec, I murder sectors, prefer to let ya
See it rather than say it, but it spill out, I gotta chill out
Say “Fuck the world” and never pull out
We had no Bob-Lo boat but I could note
Those times is like a Bible quote
BC, before cell phones, the first time I would smoke
I was six years old, but that’s for another chapter
That’s for another story, to God be the glory
I made it out unscathed and now I sunbathe
With my son in Tanzanian sunrays thinking ’bout them days
Thinking ’bout them days

This is; 808-Ray
Nigga don't worry about what the fuck it is, just drink
Yeah! I don’t know what else to say
I can’t, I can’t think of nothin'
I’m stumped, here we go!
On your feet! Stand up! Everybody hands up!
Uh, man, I don't know man
Every time I go to think of something played out to say
You already said it

I ain't callin' names 'cause all of y'all the same
Plus I'm the king, all my past pain all done changed up
All these plains, all these lames, since the Slaughter's came up
'Cause they know their hands tied, feet ball and chained up
Niggas be quick to call me the new 50 Cent
Because of my relationship with Marshall
Used to make me a little partial, but here's the brain fuck
We the same, 'cause
I'm probably 'bout to fall out with a young buck
While I attempt to fuck the fuckin' game up
Bitch, splat! Only thing I fear in here is chit-chat
You are hearin' bars like your ear against a Kit Kat
Shady guys like the Navy, try us, wavey bye-bye
Maybe my Glock can turn your top to Baby's Maybach
My shit is parvo, literally sick
Trust me, nigga, it's ugly to kill; the thing is, the bigger I get
The more disgustin' and fuckin' disfigured it gets
Niggas expect me to go pop, oh, stop
Y'all about the Champagne, I'm about the toast, I
Only fuck with mailmen with heroin from Boca
Niggas that'll smoke you while you starin' in your postbox
Only incense he enlightens when he's thinkin'
While that sinks in, I got a Brinks ink pen
I'm back! Motherfucker, notice the flyness on the cover
Of the XXL, I'm back from the dead
Like Tobey Maguire from the Brothers
How y'all realer? If I said it, I did it
If I didn't, I seen it first-hand like a card dealer
Give up the throne: your lease up; I am the Mona Lisa
That decoded Da Vinci Code, you throwin' your piece up
Is a waste of fake like a phony B-cup
Makin' the mistake was like my only teacher
Wait 'til they get a load of me, 'cause—

I've got Guccis on my feet, diamonds on my neck
Diamonds on my wrist, bitches on my dick
But y'all already said that
Choppers in the trunk, models in the front
Bottles in the club, but I don't give a fuck
But y'all already said that

'Cause sometimes I feel like it's so hard for me
To come up with shit to say, ayy
I'm at a loss for words, 'cause y'all already said it all
I think I'm runnin' outta clichés
I'm gettin' writers block, psyche!

When I stand up in this booth, niggas notice it
Sittin' on the same boat that Noah built
Floatin' on the same water Moses split
Poetry in motion, but we sittin' on your grave site: overkill
Aren't you tired? Why are you so loud? Quiet
Real dudes move in silence, like a mute drivin' a new hybrid
You dudes is too excited
You a dude that'd try to sue a dude that's suicidal
You will just be another victim
I'm like a nickel of weed rolled in a doobie: I'm a little twisted
I roll like the end credits in movies, y'all just got scripted
Got y'all niggas' bitches bobbin' to this one when she wit' ya
When she with me, she bobbin', not vibin'
Tryna put her mind into the inside of my zipper
I'm a serpent with a purpose
Havin' problems? Not a problem
I've encountered, I have found elephants, lions, clowns
Will jump through hoops like they workin' for the circus
If the fire 'round the circle's right in front of them, fire rounds
Pun intended, gun extended, what are you marks askin'?
Car's Aston, started as a hard-top and I saw past it
Since I decided to start class, this all black, all glass
Panoramic roof been gettin' marked absent
I authorize my own all-access
Your bitch a whore, I'm a catch, she ball-catchin'
Her jaw's been broadcasted
All across the globe from the store to Japan
Her pussy need to be blocked and reported as spam
Interscope, I been this dope
Now sell it, my voicemail is full
Got bitches screamin' inside of envelopes
And they tryna mail ‘em to me
Tryna reach my phone, I don't know which one is harder:
Tryin' not to take your bitch or tryna get rid of my own

I've got Guccis on my feet, diamonds on my neck
Diamonds on my wrist, bitches on my dick
But y'all already said that
Choppers in the trunk, models in the front
Bottles in the club, but I don't give a fuck
But y'all already said that

'Cause sometimes I feel like it's so hard for me
To come up with shit to say, ayy
I'm at a loss for words, 'cause y'all already said it all
I think I'm runnin' outta clichés
I'm gettin' writers block, psyche!

Man, get the bozac!
We need to start bringin' that shit back (Mad flava!)
Man, fuck it, I'm 'bout to catch some wreck
(We in effect, money!)
Mad props to Royce for keepin' it real
On the strength, no diggity
I'm 'bout to go pull some hoes, get my mack on
Haters get the gas face!
I'm the verbal-spit Smith Wesson
I unload with sick spit
The quick wit could split a split-second
Bomb with a lit wick expression
You hear a tick tick then you testin'
My saliva and spit could split thread into fiber and bits
So trust me, I'm as live as it gets
Everybody claim they the best and they head the throne
Since B.I.G is gone, if you ask me, they "Dead Wrong"
My flow is hotter than the flash from the click
When the hammer slaps the bullet on the ass from the clip
You wind up in a room full of my dogs
I'll have you feeling like a fire hydrant in a room full of dogs
So come, come now, get pissed on, shitted on
Tough talk turns to, "Can't we all just get along"
You get blazed when the mic's off, shot when it's on
You probably ducked when they laid the gun shot in your song
My gun st-stutters when it speaks to you
Utter shit to repeat to you
Enough in the clip, to give a speech to you
Me and Premier, we kind of the same in ways
We both speak with our hands in dangerous ways
Rap now is a circus of clowns
A whole lot of lip from cliques I'd probably rap circles around
I'm the next best to reach a peak formerly known
As the best kept secret, I guess that I just leaked it

"Tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb"
"Boom, boom, bam, God-damn"
Royce 5'9
"Tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb"
"Boom, boom, bam, God-damn"
Royce 5'9

I'm a motherfuckin' star, I don't battle no mo'
I provide the gun clapping round of applause after your show
And we could go toe-to-toe 'cause they calling you hot
Stepping around all your punches like, "That's all you got?"
Everyday I'm meeting somebody and all of they peeps
Quick to shake a nigga's hand and show me all of they teeth
And these bitches, I be patting they asses
They be all dumb and googly-eyed looking at me, batting they lashes
Rappers think Detroit niggas not as down as them
Or since that I'm down with Slim that I sound like him
Quick to judge me and tell me that my hook might sell
And say faggot shit to me like I look like L
My advice: quit talking, it's over
I was knockin' niggas out when you was knocking sticks off of they shoulders
I got dirt done in my past, I know y'all sweat
I got regrets older than some of you so called vets
Niggas say I found God with the flow
Bring the police to the studio and bring the bomb squad to the show
Ain't a nigga touching mines
When you listen to my shit
You don't chew, you don't breathe
You don't miss a fucking line
Every time I spit, I tick to show you it's hot
Leave me in the deck too long, I blow up your box: boom

"Tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb"
"Boom, boom, bam, God-damn"
Royce 5'9
"Tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb"
"Boom, boom, bam, God-damn"
Royce 5'9
"Boom, boom, bam, God-damn"
Royce 5'9
"Boom, boom, bam, God-damn"
Royce 5'9
"Boom, boom, bam, God-damn"
Royce 5'9
You will not be able to stay home brotha
You will not be able to plug in, turn on and cop out
You will not be able to lose yourself on scag and skip out for beer during commercials
Because the revolution will not be televised

This right here for the number one
Number ones here with your number one
You ain't number one, just another one
Now everybody sayin' that they number one

Ring the alarm, the caterpillar keeps firing, ohh
We in the war, where butterflies keep dyin' (ahh)

I'm a product of Parker Lewis and Kubiak
If I didn't do this, where in the fuck would you be at?
See there's a difference between us, what I spit hit arenas
You a drip from my penis, I eat lions and sip hyenas
You number one when it come to slaughtering mics
I'm tryna be number one in my son and daughter life
Uhh, all you niggas my little rapper babies
Y'all my children, y'all bit my shit and contracted rabies
Don't you grade me next to these rappers, baby, that's degrading
My style got so many different facets
I switch into so many different passions
I'm skippin' class to be fascinatin'
My pen is like Big Ben, this shit's just a classic waiting

Now everybody sayin' that they number one
Kid think your number won't quit
Number one song, get your number one chick
Number one fly with your number one kick
When it's all done then your number gon' switch

Hold up, wait a minute
Guess what I'ma never do? Show so much respect to you
That I feel like we're friends, so now we no longer competitors
That could be the death of you
Never let someone who's not as smart as you
Gas you up and tell you somethin' you never knew
Always stay professional, you always gon' make revenue
Don't let people next to you that don't want the best for you
It's completely normal to hold on to a regret or two

Number one song, get your number one chick
Number one fly with your number one kick
When it's all done then your number gon' switch

Yeah, sold a quarter million records in my first week
And BET still don't wanna let me perform
Maybe it's 'cause my pigment, maybe I'm being ignant
Maybe it's all a figment of my imagination
And exaggeration exacerbates that I'm the illest, yes
How many are willing to kill us?
We the realest, that's why they feel us the best
But I don't give a fuck about this rap shit, not really though
Shittin' on a brother I should love, man, that's silly, yo
Fuck all this division and lyrical incision
It's time to unify cause hip-hop is beautiful, it's you and I
And it doesn't discriminate if you black or white
And you Christian or Muslim
It just love 'em and put nothin' above 'em
I just want to be remembered as a good person
Dispersin' a message of hope while the world worsen
And the media will still find a way
To turn us into clickbait and misquote
Wanna keep the peace, but if you do that
I'ma slit throats, sike, nah
"Logic's such a hypocrite", you can take a hike, nah
Right now, I'm here to talk about suicide and depression
Anxiety, mental health and all that other shit
You scared to mention
Yeah, I could talk about the millions I've amassed
But now just ain't the time or place
It's crazy how everyone so obsessed with my race
Cause I'm proud to be black, but matter fact
If it was flipped around and every time somebody asked me
What it was like to be a white rapper
"What's it like to be a white rapper, Logic?"
Oh and I was just like, just never talked about it like
"Man, it's just so great being a white rapper
White, white, white, white everything
White man—being white's so great—wow it's so great"
And then some brother was like, "Ayy, ain't yo daddy black?!"
And I was like "Oh shit!"
And the whole world be like "What, are you scared to be black?
Are you ashamed to be black?! Motherfucker, fuck you!
Fuck you, you piece of shit, mixed, biracial, fucking cunt"
(That's how they be)
Cole said fuck all this black and white, it's time to unite
Be who you are, identify as a star
Fuck all the jewelry and money inside of yo car
You still just a person and I'm still dispersin' these lyrics
Fuck the rap ego shit, just be a good person now that's the spirit
Shoutout to true emcees that love the culture
From Duckworth to Chano, Jermaine and Joey
And Aubrey and can't forget Bobby
To every emcee who knows that this is truly a way of life
And not just a hobby, uh, not just a hobby, uh
Not just a hobby, this is a way of life
Shout out to Bobby, the L-O-G-I-C, this shit a way of life
This shit a way of life, yeah
Look at you, no pleasure in creative thinking, because you don't think creatively anymore. The real joy of being a human being is to be able to use your mind in the manner that the Almighty God has designed the human mind to do

Tug of war and my mind's like a clash of the titans
Thoughts contrast so it's layers to my writin'
God fearin', but I'm Guy Fisher
Yeah, God hearin', but I'm gone fishin'
I'm an artist, drug dealer, foreign car keys
Drop jewels so these falcons like the Maltese
Birds in the trunk so these keys, now they homin'
Letters and numbers on the Coupe like it's Roman
Woo, all black like the omen
Kim said it, yup, BIG wrote it
So I'm feeling like a Greek God when I quote it
Lightyears ahead, but I was caught up in the moment
Moment of clarity, moment of silence
Burner on my waist, yet I'm saying stop the violence
Sitting on that white horse, look at prince valiant
Dad shakes his head cause the worst waste his talents
I philosophize for them Pitchfork scholars
Devil on my shoulder and the pitchfork follows
Poking at my problems, I know how to solve 'em
With a ski mask, automatic or revolver

A slave is one whose power and authority is ruled over by another and whose sphere of freedom is limited according to the wishes of a master. Your power and authority is ruled over by another and your sphere of freedom of activity is governed by the wishes of somebody else

Them niggas wanna see me runnin', they know I won't
They say misery loves company, no, I don't
Ain't got no time for you to try on no Manolo Blahniks
All I got time to do is go back in time and pose with the Unabomber
Just so I can go back in time a second time to photobomb it
I live by a code of demonic, Illuminati, Obama, Hovanomics
Hold up, hurdles in life, I hop in a Turbo and roll around 'em
I'm Doug E. Fresh in the flesh, I beat box
I boo-boo-du-du between the sheets to seek the G-Spot
I'm in bed with three naked ladies holding hands
I'm in bed with three major labels
And I ain't talkin' 'bout wearing clothing brands
Underground locomotive man
Putting on a global show that no promoter can
I philosophize with wise words from learned lessons
In my world mistakes turns to blessings
The hate turned to destiny
I'm saying Lord Jesus while the Lord's most gorgeous creatures take turns blessing me
I got your baby momma down on all fours
When drama comin', I'm all for it
If it ain't about the money please let this be your last question
You players can jump if you want, but you half-stepping like Paul George
I make the yay invisible in like a day or two
That's how the players do, my nigga, there's layers to it

First in science, first in technology, wealthiest country on Earth, most powerful country on Earth is twenty sixth in education. So you have all been taken and you don't even realize that you have been dumbed to the point where you are like sheep

Paranoid of poverty, hustle was the philosophy
I seen a kilo, I swear it became a part of me
Lie, cheat and steal, I had it mastered by my teens
Started hands on, a nigga still pulling strings
Hotel suites, straight selling nigga's dreams
Motel 6 as I let the beeper ring
Was a water boy, but balling always in my genes
Season ticket holder, nigga sitting with the team
Feds on the roof of the spreads in the juice
So suspicious of the cars, tuitions for the schools
Labeled a mastermind, I positioned every move
Shots fired, now the deposition from the crew
Smooth operation, but the money came in knots
Forty million there, I dare you tell me what I'm not
I own fifty homes and wanna get fifty more
Counting this fast money and fucking my bitches slow
Rozay
Yeah
I wanna share some shit with y'all
All truth, all truth

Uh, like I'm standing inside a Tabernacle
I promised not to lie in not one of these verses
I started out as a battle rapper
All I knew was Maxells, ADATs, DATs and gats
Uh, my name is Ryan Daniel Montgomery
Recovering alcoholic, I grew up on 9 Mile
Uh, I'm not a gangster, drug dealer or thug nigga
Just an MC who made a name with his rhyme style
Now, sometime around '95 I found my calling
And that all coincides with the time that I found my darling
Now later on in the story, I tell you her significance
But now let's talk about me, specifically, three brothers and one sister see
My daddy taught me consistency with his fucking patterns
Hallelujah I'm the son of a addict
My addiction was music, all I would do is go to the studio and The Shelter
And listen to Redman and Heltah Skeltah

Aye y'all remember that one joint from the Heltah Skeltah album called?
Sean Price be like, "I'm not sure any—" yeah, that was my shit
I used to bump that shit all, day!
By this time I knew I wanted to be an artist
I didn't want to be anything else
You know, but my mom had plans for me
She wanted me to go to school, so you know

Uh, to make mom's happy, I took some general courses in college
Took the bus until I got hella bored with that
Because the bus stop I had to walk to
Was right across from the first studio I ever recorded at
Now I would have to assume that it was either meant for me to be rapping
Or meant for me to be laughing at God's geographical humor
As soon as I stepped foot in the open-mic, it was like a reunion
I was a shoe-in
I met Kino there too and he asked me to manage me
And that was back in like, let me see
'97, my girl was pregnant, hurdles was prevalent
And it was therapeutic just for me to breathe into my mic
Started learning why the Lord put certain people in my life
And the way he started blessing me, uh
I guess before my inner demons got the best of me like sneezing was my vice
Needless to say that December 29th was the day I became a believer in fate

Okay now it's December 28th, my day has gone great
Kino booked me a show under contract to do that night
I got a call from my girl's people saying she's in labor
In the hospital right now, 9th floor
I get on the elevator, elevator stops on the 5th floor
Elevator opens up, my uncle's standing there crying
Now I'm caught off guard, I'm like, "What the fuck?"

My uncle standing there like, "Ryan, they that way"
I walk out, I see my momma and that entire side of my family
Looking like there's some kind of drama happenin'
I said "What happened?" They like "Granny's been in a bad accident
And it ain't looking good", I'm like "Man, what?"
I'm having a baby four floors up before I froze up
I'm trying to figure out why the Lord chose us
Or maybe chose me, to ride in this emotional rollercoaster
My momma said "The baby here yet?" I said "Maybe"
She said, "Maybe? Baby, go see"
I walk away feeling like a good father, the same time as a terrible son
Get to my girl she 5 centimeters dilated so I waited
She got to get to 'bout nine 'til it's that time
And meanwhile I'm more popular in this hospital than the doctors
Nurses watching, whispering like "That's the one right there
Who got a lady in labor on 9 and another lady dying on 5"

By this time I don't even fuckin' remember that I got a show
Somebody had to remind me, the doors was already open at the venue
I got emotions runnin' every which way
All the nurses and stuff is like, "We'll keep you posted about the baby
We'll keep you posted about your granny."
I didn't like seeing my mama like that, so I had to get out of there

Yeah, I hit the stage at 11:50, killed it
I got off at about midnight with about six types
Of different emotions floatin' around inside me
Hopeless, tryna find me, hopin' in time God'll guide me
In the future, just as I was about to leave out
I saw Kino talkin' to Marshall and then he introduced us
We talked about collaboratin' and how chasin' this rap thing is aggravatin'
But I'll get back, I got the family waitin'
I get to skatin'
As soon as I get to the hospital, they tell me that my granny didn't make it
She just died, I'm feelin' helpless, it hurt me
On the flip side, my little boy is healthy in the nursery
I picked him up, looked in his eyes for the first time and just cried
Ain't no denyin' this is the power of God
I said, "I love you, Granny" and looked to the sky
Like even though he just got here, goodbye

This is how the story goes
Powerful day (now you know) powerful day (now you know)
Most significant day in my life
I mean aside from meetin' my man Marshall
My son bein' born and my granny dying on the same day
My grandma didn't live anywhere near that hospital
I learned a lot this day
I learned that the universe has this way of balancing itself out
For me to lose such a beautiful soul in my granny
And gain such a beautiful soul with my first born son, little Royce
It showed me that God is real, God is real
And you know what they say: God giveth, God taketh away
I'm legendary, legen-legendary, I'm le-le-legendary

The theme song to my supplier, plays in the key of a ki, I'm like a messiah
Crossed with The Wire, rapping around the Boardwalk Empire
Who brought their Bibles? This the Christ chapter
I'm sick enough to take my life then take your life after
Don't take me light or play me light: we two of the same
God melted the Rubic's cube into fluid and threw it into my intuitive brain
I'm eating food for moving music in the gratuitous lane
Been through twice, now I'm running through until I'm through with the game!
You can find me under a black cloud: I'm a dark star
Only thing I hate worse than a mark, is a marked car
I climb mountains like Marvin Gaye, Tammy Terrell
You could put a face on my style; it'd be Sammy Cassell's
I switch the fire up like I am a tranny from Hell
What I got in my hand right now should remind you of Stanley Burrell
Cause it's the hammer, the cannon, you can dance with the shells
My pet peeves are granny panties and planning to fail
I'm a heavyweight; I'm catastrophic
When I set it like Farenheit 9/11, meditate 'til the levees break
I tar and feather featherweights until my 'fetti straight
The MAC-11'll clap your melon and give your ass spaghetti face
You ever looked inside some dying eyes?
You'll see surprise and realize there's no denying God
When was the last time that you heard that the "I" in "try"?
Ryan vibes like cyanide; I am proud
To say that I've evolved, there's only one "I" in defying odds
Small-time arrogance perishes every time to giant pride
Who y'all respect is probably cross-dressing
Your favorite MC can probably find himself, vibing to my Lost Sessions
I'm legendary

Now everybody wanna believe me
But they don't really know what's in my heart
This time around it's startin' to feel easy
My enemies starting to fall down
(I'm legendary, legen-legendary, le-le-legendary)
My enemies starting to fall down
(I'm legendary, leg-legendary)
Fall down (le-le-legendary, legendary, legendary)
I'm legendary

I got my noodles intact
You want support of Detroit rap, niggas can Google this gat
Cause we the reason why you eating, we put the food on the map
Right where the mitten is and you ain't do jack
Just who we kidding here? This here's a different year
So you shouldn't assume that I'm tryna measure up to you
When I tell you the ruler is back, in fact
As far as you new kids, what have you did?
I know that I've burnt some bridges in the past, but I'm happy to say that I built a new bridge
As far as killing I'm forever willing and ready
I will make my children's peanut butter and jelly sandwich with a machete
You marry the streets then we will kill at your wedding
Tell every guest at your reception they gon' get more than just hit with confetti
Now your bitch a believer
You know what you get when you mix a bumblebee with a lamb?
You get the 'Ghini I'm sitting in
Riding through Pittsburgh while I'm listening to Wiz Khalifa
Black and Yellow, the blunted joint: here's the reefer
One minute you tough, one minute you shook
I know, I learned a while ago, to hide power from you, I should just put it in a book
You illiterate parasites: I kill you every time
Throw a nigga' body around the room, have a nigga looking like Jamiroquai
And yes I, am a firm believer that the naked truth
Looks a hundred times better than the best-dressed lie
And why you niggas is hating?
I wonder is God really an atheist? He made me the same temperature as his nemesis Satan
Y'all need to repent cause y'all been imitating
A statue of me, to you is a statute of limitations
You backwards as me and a feminist dating
Let's tally the sales like Gladys and Patti LaBelle: I'm a big wig
My straw's in the hole of a volcano: I'm having a big swig

Now everybody wanna believe me
But they don't really know what's in my heart
This time around it's startin' to feel easy
My enemies starting to fall down
(I'm legendary, legen-legendary, le-le-legendary)
My enemies starting to fall down
(I'm legendary, leg-legendary)
Fall down (le-le-legendary, legendary, legendary)
I'm legendary
Royce talking

You couldn't fit Bizarre's body in my shoes
Niggas quick to talk, all hood 'til I pop up
Plus, you just act tough cause Suge got locked up
I am above y'all, when you droppin your raps to diss me
I only recognize the top of your hats
And I don't like Proof punk-ass, he think he tough

I ever catch you by yourself, I'mma fuck you up
Snatch your little cheap-ass chain and piece you up

Since Slim signed 50, I don't see your teeth as much
That's good, cause you got a grill like a fuckin truck!
DAMN HOMIE, it's history, over, hang it up
Go somewhere and hang up some 50 posters, PUNK
You speak too late, y'all prolly gon' go up to them awards
And get yo' ass whooped by B2K
I just wish Eminem would stop tellin' everybody he ain't speakin' to me
Like I'm one of his hoes or somethin'
How 'bout this, I ain't speakin to you, chump
And I'mma keep pickin on your weak ass crew
(You bitch!) Bizarre you a fat stutterin fuck
You a joke, I choke whoever buttered you up
I've been ridin by your house, you don't come out too much
You hidin, when I find you I'mma snatch you out of that truck
And tie your fat stankin ass to your couch and just

Nigga you can run or hide; I'll be on your porch
With a cheeseburger tryin to lure you outside!
Cause he's in it, Bizarre say G-g-g-g-g-g-unit
I bet you throw some extra "g's" in it
Just like a stutterin' fool can't reach intelligence
He sweats when he raps, cuz he got a speach impediment
(You bitch!) Porky's pig and Porky's tomb
About to dig his own grave with a fork and spoon
(You bitch!) Denaun and Swifty please
Give it a year, both y'all be rakin' 50's leaves
What do I know, that other nigga y'all got in your group
I don't even know his name, but he can shovel my snow
(You bitch!) Let's face it I gave it to y'all
My lil' sister got six puppies that's braver than y'all (barking sounds)
Niggas is startin' the beef I'm 'bout to end with the quickness
I'm 'bout to end this quicker than Bizarre can finish a biscuit
Quicker than quick shit, y'all ain't felt the half
Quicker than Eminem can pinch Elton's ass
Don't call me, I ain't ready to squash it yet
Kiss my ass! I don't wanna talk to Hex!
I am so sick I should be compared to cancer
Y'all thought y'all dudes don't swing like Fred G. Sanford
I be makin' motherfuckers scratch their heads when I rhyme
Y'all lil' niggas crack ya heads then rhyme, go play;
You lil punk ass niggas, y'all can scream and yell all you want
I feel like I'm battlin' Keenan & Kel
(You bitch!) None o' y'all can put in the call to Kino
Paul better call me, like he called Benzino
Matter o' fact, I might even do a song with Ray
Sign with Murder Inc. and hit you with a song a day
We gon' beat yo' ass DOWN (4x)

I don't even want you lil' punks to think I'm mad
Y'all lil' niggas are Ninja Turtles, you're nothing

What did you do, got on the phone and called him up
You don't wanna talk to Royce, but you talk to us
(You bitch!) Yo' crew some local hoes
I hit you harder than that white girl that broke your nose
You and Royce can squash this with one talk
Step around from your security and talk to that man
I understand you backin' yo' crew, but this my brother
Anythin' that happen to him, somethin' gonna happen to you
And I don't give a fuck for that, nigga, I'll do life
I advise you to stop; yo' money don't buy you stripes
Only thing that money brings is fake niggas and problems
Followed by niggas who hate fake niggas and rob 'em
But you niggas is WACK; Denaun I'mma stab you
So many times, I'mma feel bad when you collapse!
You niggas is so BITCH you make me sick to my stomach
Every beat that you ever made sound like it was missin' somethin'

So low
Door is closed
Trust is broke
Words got choked
In my throat
Can't let go
Of my high hopes
My high hopes
My high hopes
(Say what?)

Papa came home from another day of hard
Work and handed me his key, told me "Go look in the car"
So I went out there to look for what he asked me to get
I was checkin' all the seats but the only thing I saw
Was a bag of cocaine (Say what?)
Uh, Papa was too silent, he ain't never tell a lie
I went in to tell him 'bout it, he said "Oh, that must be Guy
He worked with me at the job", I said "Oh" and walked away
He said "Oh, before you go, make sure you don't tell your ma'
'Bout the, cocaine" (Say what?)
Uh, me and little homie, we was walkin' to the store
It was right there on the corner and we seen a guy that's homeless
He was wrapped up in a blanket, he was lookin' really cold
Then he asked us for some change and he asked us if we know
Who had the, cocaine (Say what?) Cocaine
I'm losin' my mind, trying to figure out
How did I inherit so much pain
I drink a lot of alcohol, problems with the law
Would I have done better or the same
If Daddy never tried cocaine? Uh
Daddy never tried cocaine
Cocaine, uh (Say what?)

In my throat
So my father's only next logical step was to go to rehab
Can't let go
And that's exactly what he did
Of my high hopes
He went to rehab and got completely clean
Hasn't done a drug
My high hopes
In over 20 years
He did that for himself but
My high hopes
He did that because he didn't want to lose us
Whew, strong man

Uh, now let's talk about how much I respect my pop
He's been through so much in life, we ain't never had a lot
We just had each other's back, that was really all we need
Pop, I love you unconditional and thanks for loving me
More than, cocaine
My father chose me over cocaine
Cocaine, uh
I'm proud to say that I'm an addict who inherits your pain

Trust is broke
Words got choked
In my throat
Yeah, I'm starting to have fun now, so you know

I got the keys, keys, keys
I got the keys, keys, keys
Y'all are the kings, kings, kings
I roll up to squeeze
Y'all are the kings, kings, kings
Well, I'm about to see, I'm about to see
I talk scrilla like a art dealer
I'm large money that's been augmented for the small printer
Homocide business got me side flipping like I'm cartwheeling
I'm Godzilla wearing Margiela in the mall inside of the Guitar Center
Got the boss mental
Got me off a little barking at the dog kennel
Keys open doors, I said keys open doors, squeeze open fours
Leave your boys leaking, leave your overlord lookin' like some old weave on the floor
Please don't ignore me, I'm going to war
Blowing weed in a foreign toy
My shooters killing anything I'm pointing towards
Anything I'm pointing towards
I would swing this mic when I'm rhyming, thought I better bring it
I’m what you’d get if Fetty Wap were to rob a marksman
With Robert Markman, a dead eye Genius
A Jedi demon, he sip promethazine, I bet I lean him
I made a million, I ain't sell out, I just got the hell out Neiman's
Nigga, my chips up, ask me "am I in my P-R-I", I stop you just so I could spell out Pringles
I'm in the strip club, I shell out singles
I'm the flowing boss sweeping semis, pick one
Head or tails, either way, you are about to let Akeem in
I came in here to grow the crime rate
Bodies on top of bodies on me
I got skeletons in my closet that could do the "Famous" video with Kanye
My status loony, nigga, I love my chrome
IMac and Uzi more than Donald Glover love that song "Bad and Boujee"
"Bad and Boujee," I'm a black addict mooly
With an attitude in a padded room full of savage ghoulies
Eratic goonies
I don't battle, I look at battle dudes like "Battle? Who, me?"
Fuck you niggas, I'm steady waiting, I fed him bake
You know that devil's food, them Betty Cakes
And I got something for them crooked cops too, let him pray
Turn his wedding day Freddie Gray
Let that machete behead him, set him straight
Let it devastate, let his soul levitate, let the levies break
I'm murderous, I got Reaganomics in my verbiage
I'm a wavy rhymer, a Mercedes rider
I'm a 89'er Cartier with diamonds
At the furrier, Saint Laurent sipping Merlot
You would never catch me boxing with the burner
Hundred in your mouth like Ted DiBiase did to Virgil
Rolling over these hurdles playing C Murder then I'm playing G Herbo
Gang of cash on me, keep the thumper with me since I became a sinner
Black youngster, I don't know if I'mma tip the waitress tonight
Or make it rain for dinner
I don't know if I'mma sign a deal or stay independent, it's not just a simple thing
Aston Martin topless while I'm weighing my options on the triple beams
Learning that life ain't about the expensive shit, it's about the simple things
Like a sexy side bitch with zipper lip, clit nipple rings
You can not stop what is already going
African bitch got her face on my lap
The blacker she is, the badder she is
I was called tarbaby growing and I'm feeling up to par
Whenever I see the police
I address them as top of the morning 'cause I feel above the law
Riding, do I look like I am supplying the drugs? Fuck raw
I am the plug, fuck raw
You niggas is about as much action as a buttoned-up bra
I'm taking everybody instrumental, going Ted Bundy on it
Out here cooking so much the original sound like it's Peg Bundy on it
I'm Christmas gifting, y'all wrapping shit
I fit the description of accidents in the axel of the bent
I have an immaculate acumen
You a splitting image of accidental flatulence
All it takes to be a gang banger on wax these days
Is the engineer that come in and patch you in
Yes, sir, I'm too charming to stress ya
I'm cool, calm, and collective
I'm electric, you Carmen Electra
If I catch ya you gone on the stretcher
Now question
How much protection does a vest and armor get ya?
Especially when you armed with weapons stepping in the wrong direction of armageddon
Uh, keys, keys, y'all got the keys, keys
Ride up and squeeze, squeeze
Y'all are the kings, kings, heh, well, I'm about to see
Trust the fucking shooter

Uh
We in here counting dead president heads
Up in the years, it’s been up in the mills of dead president heads and counting
They put pictures of dead president heads on green, long papers
Then went and put dead president heads on mountains
How we ain’t gon’ make it?
You know what

I went from women asking “what’s the scent of your fragrance?” to center of attention
To dinners in Vegas, then all the way to Japan racking up yen
Now I’m all the way back
And I’m acting like Dennis in Vegas, stacking up wins
I’m a young black boy, armed, dangerous
To those who want to come and try harm or change him
While they’re living in anguish, while I’m living in real nigga harmony
Energy around me blend together like falsettos, tenors, and bass
All intelligence is on God level
All memories formed in melodies from the 70s
And all hail to all dinners and plates
And all hail to the cartels, and we out on a yacht
And you know how we know that we are and you not?
Because y’all are looking at our sales
I’m a motherfucking one-man army
I’m more R than our, I put the 'R' in ourselves
Uh, I’m the one they can’t generalize
Every time I come through straight, their wave minimize
Why? It’s probably ‘cause I gun through they gay enterprise
Niggas get crowned quick these days
Street this, best this, king that, we ain’t seen that
All we see around your clique is squad cars
Niggas need to get crown vicked these days
Stop kicking it, you couldn’t fit in my old socks
Let alone my shoes
I’m not a street nigga, I’m just a chip off the old block
I ain’t rocked with an entourage since ‘07
Niggas dissed Marshall after they copy his whole reference
Like we won’t send an actual firing squad to their studio
That will Basquiat their whole session
A lot of niggas dope, but none concern me though
I got that Pac, Big L, Pun eternity flow
I got that blowing that weed, taking that last drag in
And tossed in the infirmary glow
I’ll hit your broad in the gall bladder with this bald dagger
Have her hollering “not the knife” ‘til she having an orgasm
And all of her juices is haul-assing down the thighs
God dropped me off in the drop with the crossroads with crossed toes and dotted eyes
I’m not alive, I wasn’t born, I got a ride
Uh, get your popcorn, idolize ‘cause I’ve arrived
This is Cam Newton throwing bullets with the band shooting
This is beat submission from Bas Rutten
This the  it's proven
Nigga, pay your dues, you’re past due here
This cash rules, you’re looking at the wrong paper, this bad news
Relax junior, you still think you’re in high school
But you not, but you will be looking at your last new year
Ha, boo-ya, bombs over Baghdad
Compliments since 7 Mile, Fenkell Ave, Cash and Poo Bear
With directions to just go blasting through there
I ain’t stressing ‘bout none of you poindexter responses
I ain’t tongue wrestling with no artist unless it’s Ashanti
Nigga this, God, Gandhi, Kevlar labcoat
Mixed together with leather bathrobes like Plies and Fonzi
Cool science, I’m around lions and giants
You there, Ryan’s here
No one can hear you crying where I’m at, the highest tier
One diss track could tear your whole act up like the Flatbush Zombies
Gripping the Mac truck with Travis Scott, hitting your Macbook
I’m not a pioneer, I’m the last of a dying prayer
Living in forever, ever, ever, ever, ever in laughter
And ever since that heffer put me on MediaTakeOut
I ain’t fucked a basic bitch since
I got sophisticated bitches coming to my place asking “is it safe to sit?”
I said, “only if you have to take a shit”
Country chick named Delores, I let her sit on this Mason dick
Rappers blew up and get to shouting out designers
I like to thank my notebook, it got me out of the binders
Blacks never had each other’s backs
Rappers saying “All Lives Matter”? Okay, now we’re actually spineless
I’m into psychology nowadays, she say she bad
I’ll probably brainwash her like Hollywood did Stacey Dash
A lot of guys out slanging for a belt buckle like Pootie Tang
Wada-Tah!
5’9” the illest MC of all time right now and all the time
Kneel right in front of me like feel sobriety, young'n, or fall in line
Uh, right now, I’m piranha dipping in waters of Flint with the Slaughters and Em
Come on in, dummy, the water’s fine
Sniff around, I smell just like money, I ain’t hard to find
I’m doing big things
This bitch asked me do I got at least 50 shades
Just the other day
I said, “come here, let me kick game
I got more than 50 shades and just grey is the colorway”
I gave my momma a pic of myself in a big frame
And a card that says “bitch, I’m Rick James” for Mother’s Day
Uh, I just thank the Lord and pray for more
I just lifted the skirt of the devil
I don’t really care how you're dress her
Nigga, I'm just out here to take your drawers
Make the winner fall on the track
Let nature take it's course
I'm a product of the old Death Row camp
I ain't a fan of his, he might want to be standin' clear
I come with the cannon, not the cameras
I ain't Shannon Briggs, but let's go champ
Let's slow dance
Kill you with the first and give you seven more, necromance
Best flow versus yo petrol rants, you gassin'
This that new black Bent, blue Aston
This that who dat against who askin, who ya again
'99 the Outsidaz told me I wouldn't last
I'm too arrogant
But here I am, two boys two girls two era's in
And they over there on pills and heroin
Forks in they careers so that's real embarrassin'
If I could just get you clean through my charities
I might just let you breathe through me vicariously
But then again, I might not cuz I don't write sparingly
I'm torn between get along, fight, and why can't we
Fuck the Stitches approach
If I have to show up, I'm slashin' your throat
Your arms are too O.G. Maco to box with O.G. Wacko the G.O.A.T
I'm not a factor, I'm the whole problem
Down to subtract for a fraction of folks
Your favorite artist a diva
I put leaves around the heads of non-believers like drawings of Ceasar
Wake me when the sleepers are done ignoring me, bruh
I'll be flying with a full tank of gas on ether
If you from the block, watch y'all sons
Watch y'all daughters, cuz I saw murder
Slaughter much as I saw hot sauce and hot dog water
I came a long way from wishin' under the stars
But I ain't come all of this way just to say I've come this far
Coppin' paintbrushes with black cards
There's no limit when it comes to this art
No need for twitter followers, I dodged prison
I'm the non-equivocal black and at large
Listenin' to a Timbaland track in a villa in Calabasas
I'm that same little Cringer and Battle Cat kid
Addict specialty pen and pad scenematics spazzin'
Fuckin' wit' a bitch about as bad as my spendin' habits
I got nowhere askin' can I have it
All the valuables I have in this world, I had to take it
Had to open King Tut's tomb up in my imagination
Had to separate fear from respect then admiration
Get rid of your fears
Time to remove doubts and
Think about it, there's two sculptors named Gutzon and Lincoln
Who carved dead president heads
Who got paid dead president heads by the president
To move a mountain
Contemporary art deco
We keep the shit rockin' like the dails of Art Basel
Stompin' through this hip-hop shit like it's our step show
We survive
We should have bar mitzvahs for these bars
We the gods
We should shoot bar missiles with these bars
Beat the odds, look at the car see the rides
Don't be surprised, just realize
We ain't runnin' for president
So, we ain't worth shit
Unless we alive
Whatever, whatever, whatever
Mr. Porter don't trust you, I'm gon' bust you, nigga
That thang pop, pop pop
Whatever, whatever, whatever
(If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you)
Whatever, whatever

This that "your career's over" flow, for real
This ain't four-wheelin', roll with coke, heroin, 'caine
Bone chilling, cold with no feelings
Bangin dope-dealin-Hov and No-Ceilings Wayne
Started out like Nas, shoot gun
Heavy is the head with the crown
Slaughterhouse, my mind's two tons
Hardest out like John Q's son
And everything you say greasy
And made up like a piece of cheesesteak
And everything I say come natural
In this thing of beauty, like Alicia Keys face
How can I be hated in the streets
When I'm on even on my off day
I'm creative when it's beef, while you throw salt
I'm your baby mama and them new salt bae
I'll assault they a la carte tray
Molotov through your restaurant window
Mr. Hyde, Dr. Jekyll, Nickel Nine, Ricky Grimes
I'm Sylvester Mindbender
I spark fours, that'll arch floors
That'll have whoever acting hardcore
Doing parkour, I'ma dog Porter
Brought the dog for, recording harsh thoughts for the art form
Taking me to your leader is like
Showing Chuck Norris where a glass door is
While I'm just tryna stay outta jail
Last war I stay strapped for it
Y'all can run while the gats blowing
And if I miss your ass, then I guess
You saved by the bell, like Zack Morris
I'm on bando time when I ride through cities
Before my time R.I.P. Bobby Krissy
Or Bobby, Whitney, flow K-Ci, JoJo
Let the Tech N9ne go KC, MO., bro
I don't stand my ground, I just demolish niggas
Simple you against me you ain't ridin' with me
Bitch not only do I kiss and tell
I'm Orlando Brown when I describe them titties
I'm the rubberband man, but I do more than count bands
Fuck sipping 40 ounces, I'm sober out here
Fucking hoes like 40-ounce Van
Nigga I'm Pusha T doing quiet numbers
Getting silent money, I'll retire from it
I don't dress loud, I throw the flyness on it
Let the labels talk and Desiigner mumble like Donald Trump
Throwing money hitting everybody and they auntie up
Trying to find someone to come perform for me 'fore I fuck the whole entire country up
I'm the first one gunnin', last one runnin'
Too enlightened for a check (yeah)
Any rapper that want it, I'm Wack 100
Invite 'em to a scrap (yeah)
I narrow down shit the Farrakhan way
You can find me anywhere the crime wave
I'm Schwarzenegger, you Sarah Conner
And your favorite rapper act like Eric Andre
Ryan's still alive, played nice 'cause the drama still flies
Even when you shoot your little Uzi vertical in broad day
Like you still tryna kill God
I'm French kissing with a "bitch you" mentality
Voodoo and como talle vous
While I'm hula hoopin' dollars for that snarly tooth
My future look like juju in a body suit
When you niggas gon' admit it?
That I'm better than the youngins
That I'm better than the legends
Never did I dumb it down or did I settle
I'm Rick the Ruler in every different measure
I ain't just the R, I'm every different letter
I can give your chick eleven inches if she let me get the leverage
I can be president of hip-hop which is let me switch endeavors
And I'm just having an open workout in Heaven
Tryna get me a good sweat
I'm Jae Millz looking up at the sky like, "Ayo B.I.G, am I good yet?"


When you a fiend for the rhythm and the beats just keep callin' ya
They keep callin' ya
They keep callin' ya

When it's hard to understand me 'cause my jaws keeps lockin'
My parents keep callin', the Lord keeps watchin'
I'm standing on the corner with my boys, beat boxin'
And anywhere I go, all of these whores be jockin'

The dogs keep barkin' at the top dog
They already lost it, nigga, it's a lost cause
I remember when I had to pawn all my jewelry
Was so embarrassed by the help that no one offered to me
Zoning off the bottle, we only taught to fight back
We only talk survival, walking home, we just might scrap
All we did was write raps, tryna get so drunk
Had to get my sight back, product of the old gun
Made some bad decisions so early on in the process
I had people out to get me, my album wasn't even out yet
I'm talking 'bout the self-proclaimed "King of Detroit"
I seen some people reaching they dreams, some people destroyed
I seen people die at the hands of the violence of man
Seen people shot out the sky, being fly as they can
Seen 'em split the pie up and Pam sniff her entire two grams
Slipping, now we in your crib to tie up your fam
'Cause it's hard to really focus when you're tryna stack for ya
Lawyers, with those in power tryna blackball ya
It's hard to find employers like accountants that's loyal
With those who told ya they adore tryna back-door ya
You ain't on-point though, one minute, you popping trunks
Next minute, you happy man, next minute, you sloppy drunk
Every January 1st, the ball keeps droppin'
And I'm just celebrating it at the mall, we shoppin'
Celebrating friendships, "Bro" this, "Cuz" that
"Fam" this, borrow that, loyal this, trust that
Comas after comas that were alcohol induced
If I ain't wake up from 'em, I won't ask what y'all would do

When it's hard to understand me 'cause my jaws keeps lockin'
My parents keep callin', the Lord keeps watchin'
I'm standing on the corner with my boys, beat boxin'
And anywhere I go, all of these whores be jockin'

I had to bite down, bite down
A nigga had to bite down, bite down
All I could do was bite down, bite down, down
Bite down, bite down, I had to

Hundred yard dash through the hood, talking money runs
Using that money counter, getting rid of them funny ones
You know the ones, too wrinkled to go in them slot machines
Throw 'em on the titty bar floor to lower a thot esteem
You could be the hottest thing and still have the wrong team
Sometimes to see the bigger picture, you need a wider screen
I got the arm out the black beatle, beating the drum
Mannequin challenging whole families, viva la drunk
It's Nickel Season, the fever's begun
I'm savage, even though my tat issa knife, I'm keeping a gun
Loaded cartridges, stolen cars with the Lowenharts
Rip the game apart and you are not worthy like Wayne & Garth
By now, my life's so righteous, I don't even sleep with groupies
I move like that nigga Spike Lee when he was Mookie
Back in high school, I really clowned
I said I'd do the right thing if Rosie let me ice cube them titties now
But this is realer than movie depictions
What you niggas know 'bout making a move in a beef and truly committin'?
It ain't no squashing it after you push a certain button
Make sure everything under your lip cut and your shirt is tucked in
Burning your beard away with Magic Shave
COs frisking your pregnant bitch, turning your kids away, thataway
That'll in a shallow grave, casualty of a cabaret
Daughter calling some wack nigga "daddy" at movie matinees
Even when we deal with Saturdays, my children still know that
I don't want another man's cheap-ass ways on my doormat
And anything I do from legal to illegal
I do this shit the ski mask way, like I'm Lil Kodak

When you a fiend for the rhythm and the beats just keep callin' ya
They keep callin' ya
They keep callin' ya
Yeah, we don't wanna do anything to scare your children
That's the last thing we wanna do
Dumb
Dumb!

I'm no longer a prospect
I'm what you call a veteran, a legend man, I'm a prophet (huh)
You ain't no artist, you're what I would call a concept
Made to inspire gossip like Shade Room or like Bossip
Welcome to the Grammy's where your likeness is used
For promos, hypeness and views, okay, I hope that you knowin'
That if you voted, you might as well've not voted for no one
They knew when they made that category where that trophy was goin’
All this industry shit is (dumb) there ain’t no middle class
Raise yo glass, here's to classism
Either you a rich ass nigga or you’s a bum, there ain’t no in between
Sinners sell they souls, angels sell they halos and they wings
I had dreams of fuckin’ a R&B chick
Then I found out that R&B chick already had a dick
Already slept with your favorite rapper, aren't we sick
You start as a artist and turn to alcoholicking quick
This shit is (dumb)
Man I wish I would let a nerd who work at Interscope
In a coat by Kenneth Cole, consult me about my image bro
I’m the best rapper out this bitch
Except the only catch is that I’m in this hoe

Oh (dumb)
They so dumb (so dumb)
And nothing that they do is new
They so dumb (so dumb, yeah yeah yeah)
Oh (dumb)
They so dumb (so dumb, so dumb)
They ain't foolin' me or you
They so dumb (they so dumb, so dumb)

Let's bring the punches back
You see them fake woke niggas that had to come to that, mm
I love promotin', elevation and a space that all my brothers at
And why I'm lyin'? I be turnt up to these mumble raps
Watch who you comin' at, don't be (dumb) uh
This where Confucius started thuggin' that, uh
This Metro Boomin' mixed with Thundercat, uh
That’s where my niggas gain they muscle at, uh
Somebody eatin' off your plate, how you gon' stomach that?
'Cause of that, all my niggas is (dumb) like how we get to this year?
Man I turn basic into intricate, I kill you with my simple shit
No tweetin' when we kickin' it, don't tell me what you finna get
Silly, you could drown without a membership
Watch who you swimmin' wit, it's ten of us ridin' up on the city bus
Sittin' here tryin' hit for the scripture like it's Leviticus
Tacklin' reality, prayin' that it don't injure us, uh
I love my niggas but it's really us
When we gon' notice that we so-?

Look at what you've done, messin' with my faith, yes
You think that I'm so dumb, no, I won't be the one (I won't)
Bullets from your tongue, shootin' 'round my way
Tryna kill me off for fun, no, I won't be the one
Look at what you've done, messin' with my faith, yes
You think that I'm so dumb, no, I won't be the one (I won't)
Bullets from your tongue, shootin' 'round my way
Tryna kill me off for fun, no, I won't be the one (dumb)
Nickel, tell 'em what it is
(This is a world premiere)

Look, I'm in a zone for reala
In a freezer with Medusa, I'm fucking a stone-cold killer
Your bitch vibing, I'm inside her and I tell your kids this:
Daddy's been doing more dick riding than Kari Wigton
I'm very venomous, you very innocent and
I will send a monster to your house, call him Harry Henderson
Oh my God, I was just in jail, then the
Devil caught pneumonia, and it made me sick as hell
You niggas counting me out can get the riches still
You're all in the Matrix, shoulda picked a different pill
You about to see how far that Paul Rosenberg will go
The height of my game is like DeMar DeRozan vertical
No one understands me, only one sicker than me is Em
I'm the new 'D' MC, it runs in the family

"Man why that nigga gotta bring Em name up all the time?
Man that nigga wouldn't even be rich without that nigga"
Shut up faggot!

I come to embarrass y'all rappers
I should run a marathon backwards
So I could see what second place look like
(Too many sick niggas, Nickel bring the remedy)
(Make it real clear)
I come to embarrass y'all rappers
I should run a marathon backwards
So I could see what second place look like
(You not ready for the raw deal, it's all real, kiss the ring, be gone!)

I'm the magnificent with the sensational style
My wedding with the streets got the cake with no vows
I'm arrogant as fuck, who cares? You suck
Rappers talking about "We the best" have been to Paris too much
Who hot? Who sick? Shit, I'm like a Theraflu slush
Y'all ain't fly, y'all fallin' slow with the parachute up-up
I'm a face-slapper, niggas sleeping on an outfit
Call us Taylor Gang 'cept we Wake and Bake rappers
Slaughter/Yelawolf responsible for haters' actions
Y'all on Gilligan's Island, find a greater Captain
Ha-ha, victory laugh
Even my photographer's happy, picture me mad
I feel well, your bitch sucked my dick, I nutted on the floor
Left her standing there crying over spilled milk

I come to embarrass y'all rappers
I should run a marathon backwards
So I could see what second place look like
(Too many sick niggas, Nickel bring the remedy)
(Make it real clear)
I come to embarrass y'all rappers
I should run a marathon backwards
So I could see what second place look like
(You not ready for the raw deal, it's all real, kiss the ring, be gone!)

My swing's like chains on a playground
I bust fly plus I'm about to put some wings on a Greyhound
My theory of you is: you lie and you drink beer
And I ain't hearing ya so you must be from Liberia
I wave bye like Hitler, 100-round Thumper
Bulletproof what? You gon' need an underground bunker
I aim where you should go
I put my whole life on the net, even my weapons
I am Bazooka Joe, ugh
We the shit, nigga eat a dick
We'll make him eat his words, we the stones, he the sticks
I'm going yelling Shady everywhere
Smacking niggas' bitches with they lipstick and they baby with they teddy bear
To you and your man: ain't gon' be no Talladega Night
I come to question y'all and y'all don't know what to do with your hands
Nickle Preme, killer team
At a different dealer every day like a fickle fiend

I come to embarrass y'all rappers
I should run a marathon backwards
So I could see what second place look like
(Too many sick niggas, Nickel bring the remedy)
(Make it real clear)
I come to embarrass y'all rappers
I should run a marathon backwards
So I could see what second place look like
(You not ready for the raw deal, it's all real, kiss the ring, be gone!)
Wait, wait, wait a minute
Wait a goddamn minute
Wait, wait, wait a minute
Wait one fucking minute
I'm looking at your year end list
You're choosing rappers you're friends with
Who be rapping what their friends did
Toolie ratchets and extensions
Wait, wait, wait a minute
We done already heard their best shit
We already got the message
They on a lean, molly, Percocet trip
Think I found what real success is
Running around here since "The Message"
Forty pounder full of death wish
Money counter full of blessings
I sent a cannonball right at the cannon barrel
Through your wall, closet, through your damn apparel
Through your grandma chair, through your granite countertop
And I ain't tryna stop it 'til you standing on the doorstep
Of the man upstairs, nigga, you're next
Wait a minute, nigga
I've been going crazy on these records way before Flex
This the bad half Shady vortex, armed in navy warfare
Y'all them Barnum Bailey boys
Best to back the fuck up or get smacked the fuck up eighty million different ways
If I say it's fuck the world then the world's getting fucked
Eighty million different ways, when I'm finished with it
Then the world's gon get the AIDS like some 1984 sex
This the traumatize your favorite rapper year
This the homicide related racketeer
All I'm tryna hear today is trap and drill
It's all downhill from here like Jack and Jill, wait
Wait, wait, wait a minute
Wait a motherfucking minute
I'm giving all my hoes an ultimatum, she my mascot
I'm just tryna motivate her, I'm just popping
She's just getting ass shot like a Soulja Boy home invader
I get a whole clip to all my haters
Just so I could go and get ex-o-nerated
Wait, wait, wait a minute
Wait a motherfucking minute
I watch you niggas go tool up
I'm Compton menace on school bus
It's documented, boy, prove what?
Been dropping gems since I grew up
I got to fill this void move, bruh
The target's been destroyed, boo ya
These nerds rapping for attention
For a word from Vlad or Akademik
Prefer to slap you over engine
I'm Murs rapping for the Guinness
Wait, wait, wait a minute
I know you heard I'm back in business
I'm going harder than Tha Carter X
I'm birds flapping independent
I'm tycooning through the pressure
I'm typhooning through this weather
I might do a nigga beat for 'em
Give it back to him a little PHresher
Got the cash holding on line two, Brink's truck noise on one
Casanova with the rifle, fuckboy, don't run
I'm live from it with the streams
Buying guns and getting beams
You guys coming with your teams
It's feeling like iFunny with the memes
I flip the blade like "say something"
Around dough like Rajon
Let you rip the stage then I come and rip the stage
Down more like Trey Songz
Category slaughter gang shit
Feel me, nigga, this is God hustle
Phantom or the 'Vette
Tammy Lahren, Charlamagne shit, the odd couple
Wait, wait, wait a minute
I'm prime away from fucking mating with her
I bend her over, stick her on the expensive car
Tyler fucking Creator with it
You a lame, you from Twitter fame
You had a chain, that's your nigga chain
Face down on your computer key sleep
Closest you gon' be to laying in your name
Body bag after body bag
Leave a trail laying in your lane
I'm Cold Chillin' on the record business
But I ain't saying I distribute Kane
Wait a motherfucking minute
You popping molly with the actors
I fucked the baddest of the white bitches
I'm Talib Kweli with the blackness
I'm most def with immigration
Ladies on top of ladies
I'm Mos Def with immigration
Babies on top of babies
Wait a motherfucking minute
I have tried in vain, never had success
So it seems my life is nothing but a mess
I have lost, my only friends
Now it seems I have to start again, merry go around

My life's been going around 'n' round since '95
Went from going somewhere to about to die
Went from calling my chick a chicken
Cause she look like she got poultry around her thighs
To calling your piece a chicken cause she got no teeth
And she got crow feet, around her eyes
How hard are y'all? I got a heart the size of Arkansas
Count to five, these birds gon' hit the ground and they ain't from out the sky
Went from having an outta-this-world-flow, to doing a video doing the coon dance
To watching' my good friend Eminem winning' a moonman
I remember cause I was in New York with all of my boys to start shit
Letting 'em stay with me, long story short, they tore up my corporate apartment
Went from being a kid addicted to basketball
To being an ignorant nigga addicted to alcohol
Round and round we go is how this movie would end
Self-proclaimed King of my city, not really just truly the King of losing a friend
Who woulda thought this dude in the park who's true to his art would lose
Or win just by giving his thoughts and views

I have tried in vain, never had success
So it seems my life is nothing but a mess
I have lost, my only friends
Now it seems I have to start again, merry go around

You would hear that Ryan's skilled might even hear Ryan kills
You will never hear Ryan Stills, here to put the "i" in ill
My mind is still like a merry-go-round spill
Like leaving only guns to my kids when I'm killed, I got an iron will
Intellect of Zion, I done went too high on pills
To triumph, to hiding from bills, to buying buildings
Then I went from writing for Dre to wondering if my head was on straight
On the sidelines feeling forgot about listening to "Forgot About Dre"
From there I went to about a bottle a day
Telling who we know "Get outta my face!" okay I know what Kino said about Dre
I look at Kino to this day like that was a stupid mistake
But if it wasn't for him doing that, what would I be doing today?
If it wasn't for Cashis saying that he gonna beat my ass
Then me and Em probably wouldn't be laughing 'bout us getting past it
If it wasn't for me being outcasted I woulda never been on the underground rapping with SLAUGHTERHOUSE!

I have tried in vain, never had success
So it seems my life is nothing but a mess
I have lost, my only friends
Now it seems I have to start again, merry go around
Reflections of your strong friend
You need to check up on your strong friend
Nobody ever checks up on your strong friend
Uh, strong friend

I remember 2003, out hear screaming, "We next"
I was grippin' that 300, Rock & Rye Lexus GS
I put rhinestones in my durag, I put on leather pants
I went to parties just for Bacardi, I tricked, I never danced
All my friends expect to be treated just as my next of kin
Eyebrows lift up if I'm out with them and let them spend
The question is, "How is y'all problems becoming my problems?
I'm already hiding all of my problems behind my pop' problems"
When I was nine, seen my father beat the shit out of my momma
I'm smilin' right now, I'm trying not to cry about it
Alcoholic, I just spent five thousand tryna buy bottles of Patron again
Now sing along with your strongest friend

Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide

You need to check up on your strong friend
The one with strength that's never gon' end
The one with sense, take care of several grown men
Pay they rent and then they trade on him, the Devil play to win
I remember I had Maia Campbell in my Mercedes Benz
You probably thought she gave in to the plot of Satan's sin
She got demons greater than, you and I
And this message is to Denaun and to Shady, you say we friends?
Well take care of Lyric, 80 and baby Quinn like they Hailie then
Well shit, it's my funeral, y'all should play all of my songs too
Hope my body look beautiful, while I lay in my strong suit
Rumors spread about me that ain't true, that's how the fake do
If I'm the strong friend, then what the fuck do that make you?!

Check up on your strong friend, uh

Philadelphia meet Detroit
Time to shut your mouth (where your money at?)
Now it's time to show these motherfuckers what's the fuss about (time to go!)
What you dealing with lyrically?
A couple lyricists who don't miss
Niggas ask if Black and Nickle get together for an album, what you gon' get?
You gon' get rap on steroids, rap on steroids
Niggas that's silencers on the nozzle
You won't feel the clap, you'll only hear the noise
Ya'll got these hoes pegged so wrong while you hotel checkin'
I gotta pay these hoes just to keep their clothes on like I'm Odell Beckham
I'm flyer than a hat on Elroy
I just took it back to the Jetsons
I with the static like I got a Crooked I
Near an open exit with a bad connection
Cause no matter where you go
You're fucked if this rubber grip roll back in your direction
What you lookin' at? That's for your protection
This that rap on steroids, nigga, that rap on steroids
I just spit more clairvoyant raps
Than it take to make you half paranoid
Clap a gun at any day or night
Stand over his body then pray to Christ
Like "you gave me life so I'm gon' throw you back one, dear lord"
I'mma throw back one like Fab on the 'Gram
Garage look like it's sponsored by Hasbro
Got the whole ave going HAM
Y'all don't know with what y'all are dealing
I'm on every block, my team bigger
Cause I rap anything I wanna got
The only thing I don't got is feelings
Nigga my mind so clear
Feels like every thought is visine drippin'
No I'm not a lean drinker, but over that Fetty Wap I lean niggas
This that....

Rap on steroids
Rap on steroids
Rap on steroids
Rap on steroids

Y'all ran into me on the wrong day
Fuck strong Jay, do gon' say
Just bear arms, you in harms way
You hear alarms, you in Bombay
No Baghdad, get the gas mask
Run break, do a mad-dash to that gun safe
You un-safe in the right place to get blast at
And that's anybody
I stay on that anabolic
I'm far from anatomically correct
Ho's call me that anaconda
Roll a sack of that Santa Barbara
Lead poisonin' in the damn water
Flint, Detroit, Ann Arbor
Philadelphia and Harlem
Roid rage y'all damn problem
Cemetery too damn crowded
I'ma go get the jack hammer
Go bury a body, don't worry 'bout it, don't worry 'bout it
Everybody know everybody
I'm be damned if I didn't hear about it
Thought trifle the assault rifle
Got a twin brother like Irv Gotti, I'm 
Probably back on steroids
Kinda like crack on steroids
Lou Ferrigno super negro
Gon' and pack your steroids
Nigga my memoir's Renoirs
Everything I do is fine art
Putting rappers in that pine box
When that Black and Nickel Nine spark it's a problem
All stemming from them steroids probably
Got them coming back to Philly like it's heroin callin'
American horror, this that Smith and Wesson revolver
And if, life's a bitch we gon' Rohypnol her
They call it....

Rap on steroids

Shady, I'm rappin' on
Steroids!
Right off the rip, nobody could fuck with me
I’m out of space, mind and body, my soul and so on
Mami I’m fly is an understatement, come to greatness

I’m on my own planet, I’ll do my own thing
Then turn around and pat myself on the back, for doing good
I don’t need nobody else, I’m gon' do it by myself
Say what you wanna say but stick to the facts, it’s all good

Right off the rip, nobody is quite like me
You gon' need a NASA spacecraft to sight me
If you don’t like me, bite me
I could give a fuck, less fighting excites me
Leaning on the moon with a patron fifth
Playing my own shit, and I sound terrific
I’m not cocky, I’m beyond that
It’s time to start another hobby, I’m beyond rap
Run and tell your baby daddy and your son Ray
I’m hot, I sunbathe on the sun, bae
I’m the one on the one way
Hands and pretty long legs from the runway
My nigga Nauny is a genius
You gon' need a ladder just to climb on my penis
Got two words for the rap game, fuck y'all

I’m on my own planet, I’ll do my own thing
Then turn around and pat myself on the back, for doing good
I don’t need nobody else, I’m gon' do it by myself
Say what you wanna say but stick to the facts, it’s all good

Right off the rip, you thought it was a wrap for me
Didn’t you? Go ahead and admit it hater
Cold as ice, I’m a living refrigerator
The reason hip hop’s breathing the defibrillator
I did a bid just for drunk driving
It’ll never happen again 'cause now I’m drunk flying
I’m an innovator, when I say I’m on Venus
I don’t mean that I’m dating the tennis player
I’m on Saturn where you don’t matter
Alone, I’m past the zone where your phone scatters
Hello? Can you hear me now?
You don’t got a fucking choice
I elbowed my way into everybody’s conversations
With rhyming, timing and patience, now I’m in space, bitch
I used to have to be on some "watch what I say" shit
But now you gotta take it

I’m on my own planet, I’ll do my own thing
Then turn around and pat myself on the back, for doing good
I don’t need nobody else, I’m gon' do it by myself
Say what you wanna say but stick to the facts, it’s all good

They say a closed mouth don’t get fed
I say a closed mouth don’t give head
On the flip side, know a closed fist don’t get bread
And if you swing it then you gon’ get lead
Boy I put ‘em in a panic, got ‘em all frantic
Overlook my antics, you’ll see that I’m a throwback
Hip hop Stan Smith, but it lessen my love
'Cause the so-called rulers ain't quite measuring up
Now let me give the chicks a message
Bitter exes'll tell you that the dick is precious
Three words, get over it
And if you speak mine, mention I could trip over it
Low key like my name too big for the bill
Betty White style, get it in, still
Plus I’m on the high you can’t fit in the pill
But I try anyway, we gon’ die anyway, ya heard

I’m on my own planet, I’ll do my own thing
Then turn around and pat myself on the back, for doing good
I don’t need nobody else, I’m gon' do it by myself
Say what you wanna say but stick to the facts, it’s all good
I got the summer on lock, and the winter too (winter too)
Let me show you what a winner do (winner do)
Stay stuntin' but you broke, why you frontin'? (why you frontin'?)
We the topic of discussion
Got the summer on lock (on lock), and the winter too (winter too)
Let me show you what a winner do (winner do)
Stay stuntin' but you broke, why you frontin'? (why you frontin'?)
We the topic of discussion, got the summer on lock

Nigga, I'm so far ahead of my time, I'm 'bout to start another life
You a target, I'll probably blast you twice
Alky rappin' with the passion of Christ
Curveball through the eye of the storm, I'm the calm 'fore disaster could strike
The rocks on that watch on that dial gon' shine loud
On you hustlers who out there in brownstones like the Huxtables
Y'all came to be euthanized, I can't be de-humanized
I ain't even human, I'm paying a communion wine
Cruisin' in that Wraith, dawg, like we came to offend haters
Shoot a nigga face off like his neighbor is Tim Taylor
Racketeerin' charge, tennis match in the yard
Y'all can finish that whack shit, then it's back to the gods
I'm in the Maybach right now tryna innovate
I'm too fly, don't try to give me my props, just give me space
Your favorite artist tryna party with Puff
I'm tryna fuck Cardi in a pair of Cartier buffs, what?

I got the summer on lock, and the winter too (winter too)
Let me show you you what a winner do (winner do)
Stay stuntin' but you broke, why you frontin'? (why you frontin'?)
We the topic of discussion
Got the summer on lock (on lock), and the winter too (winter too)
Let me show you what a winner do (winner do)
Stay stuntin' but you broke, why you frontin'? (why you frontin'?)
We the topic of discussion, got the summer on lock

HA-HAAAEEH!
Uh, it's fly season, my season
As long as I don't lose, it's all cool if I die even (cool)
Yeah, we the niggas that they talking 'bout (us)
Yeah, y'all the niggas that they chalkin' out
Yeah, I just let 'em go, I don't force 'em out
Supreme Court starin' at my man as they walk him out
The time that he lookin' at is crucial
I can see the pain translated through his pupils
Turn yourself in, it's even worse when they scoop you
See the Jake, don't hit the brake, just go to neutral
Barbeques, white yacht parties, that's what he used to
Pool halls, clubs and cribs, that's what he shoot through
Work out, get your number on, Akh (work out)
Say your prayers, get your slumber on, Akh (aha)
They ain't give you life so your number gon' pop
You best believe 'til the day you come home

I got the summer on lock (our-a sun shine all day long)
Tell 'em soul hustle all day long
Our-a sun shine all day long
All-all-all day long (ah, stop frontin', nigga, hah)
I got the summer on lock

Grind all winter, shine all summer
Life's a bitch and I'm tryna keep you slime balls from her
Any leaks, we gon' fix it, none of mine call plumbers
Nina to your chest player like nine y'all number
We Rondo niggas, real recognize real, you John Doe nigga
I made a closet out of a condo, nigga
See that's flyest nigga living shit, look over the river shit
She say I'm a asshole, how, when I don't give a shit?
It's play money, my son think the foreign a toy
That's why the family gon' ball like Lavar and his boys
I realize they wanna backstab me, then turn knife
You ain't got a hunnid 'till you got two hunnid, learn life
Respect ain't earned twice, once you lose it, it's gone
And it's lame when your money right but you using it wrong
Shout to niggas coming home this summer, the juice back
Screaming OJ shootin' craps, brought the tre deuce back, yeah

I got the summer on lock, and the winter too (winter too)
Let me show you you what a winner do (winner do)
Stay stunting but you broke, why you fronting? (why you frontin'?)
We the topic of discussion
Got the summer on lock (our-a sun shine all day long)
Tell 'em soul hustle all day long
Our-a sun shine all day long
All-all-all day long
I got the summer on lock
Everything is hard, hard, hard
I mean life is hard, bills is hard
Shit, it’s all hard (hard, hard, hard)
Got to get that out your mind
I want to think that hard, be real with yourself. College ain’t for you
In fact, I want you to take up a trade
You know, become a carpenter
Did you know Jesus was a carpenter?
She don’t want you. Getting in that girl’s drawers is hard
Remember that, boy, hard
Good luck, baby

Teacher, Teacher I don’t understand what you even wanna talk for
Unless an interpreter’s gon' come up there and talk for me
Because we don’t speak the same language, you say shit like “take up a trade and your thoughts bore me”
You don’t teach me nothing, you just talk towards me
I’m gon' need your assessment and fast
Look around you, do I look anything like the rest of your class?
Can’t you see that I’m special?
I don’t act like these fucking crumb snatchers
I don’t even breathe like ‘em
I was born with my lungs collapsing
I walked right up to the drug dealer in my class and asked him
“How did you get such a bad bitch?”
He said “it was hard and the best ones are the hardest to get”
And I went on to see the world, and he went on and started the trick
And now when I see his girl, she be on my dick

I guess fucking the baddest bitches around wasn’t hard as I thought
Man, what the fuck was I thinking? (Get Money)
Jewelry and cars (cars, cars, cars)
Achieving the highest level of success ain’t as hard as I thought (top the world)
What the fuck was I thinking? (I was drunk)
I was drunk or I was lost (You was lost) (Yeah)
My people said it would be hard (Hard, Hard)
My teacher said it would be hard (Hard, Hard) (It’s gon’ be hard)
What the fuck was she thinking?
Why did I listen to y'all?
What the fuck was I thinking?

My finest hour is here, this is what I see in my prayers
This is me, though I’m facing all of my fears
Making all my enemies look in the mirror
And see the meme of the Jordan face with all of the tears
What most of you analysts ignore, it’s my explosive animal allure
I went away to get in the way of my wife planning a divorce
Handled it and came back more talented than all these rappers
Though I’m DiCaprio, all they have on me is the awards
I’m a Steinway grand piano, they’re Casios, I will kindly pass them the torch
The day that one of them are able to hold a candle to my corpse
I’ll put a hand on your whore, even if she ain’t my type
And this song is inspired by Broadway play called Hamilton I saw that changed my life
Right away, so my next move is to either screenwrite a movie or write a play

I said fucking the baddest bitches around wasn’t hard as I thought
Man, what the fuck was I thinking? (Get Money)
Jewelry and cars (cars, cars, cars)
Achieving the highest level of success ain’t as hard as I thought (top the world)
What the fuck was I thinking? (I was drunk)
I was drunk or I was lost (You was lost) (Yeah)
My people said it would be hard (Hard, Hard)
My teacher said it would be hard (Hard, Hard) (It’s gon’ be hard)
What the fuck was she thinking?
Why did I listen to y'all?

I’m looking like the black Bond in Africa
Hotel room look like a beautiful crime scene, in fact it’s a
Spectacular Halle Berry, Vivica massacre
Left behind by a serial bachelor
Fall back, y’all, I really don’t fall back enough
You’re not gon’ not sound soft to us
The shotgun will throw a box of black balls at ya like Count Chocula
That last line, I was just on my Pharoahe Monch
Rappers, kneel before me like I’m trying to prepare a punt
I’ll cut your body up and put it in two different cars
Put it in the river, have you swimming in a pair of trunks
Momma asking when I’m coming to the church
My little brother asking for the Aston
I threw the keys to him like I’m fronting up some work (Ha, good looking, Nickle)
I used to not be a trendy guy
Now I probably got more pairs of Balmain jeans than Wale and Envy got
Ah, somebody pinch me
Pardon me

Teacher, teacher, I’m so sorry I’m late
I’m Lyric Montgomery’s father, I’m here for Career Day
(Hi, Mr. Montgomery)
Can I talk to the kids?
Hello, children, how was your day?
I’m Royce Da 5’9”, and over the years
I’ve been blackballed
I’ve been in jail
I’ve seen lives turned
But guess what I’ve learned?

I learned that fucking the baddest bitches around wasn’t hard as I thought
Man, what the fuck was I thinking? (Get Money)
Jewelry and cars (cars, cars, cars)
Achieving the highest level of success ain’t as hard as I thought (top the world)
What the fuck was I thinking? (I was drunk)
I was drunk and I was lost

And you know what else
Everybody asking me just because I'm a lyricist in this business
How come I haven't gone broke yet?
I tell 'em it's cause I'm the flyest backpacker ever
I'm flyer than Mos Def in a Trump tower surrounded by four chefs
Fixing him some salmon croquettes with Kendrick, Cole and Kweli
In their Jidenna clothes, try me, you and your crew will bleed
Y'all bums ain't shot for the stars since New Years Eve
Nothing was given to me
I had to go upside heads just to get upside hills
Never over the hill though, so I don't strike when the iron is hot
I strike whenever the fuck I feel
I eat what the fuck I kill
I got this way from not being allowed to eat dinner
If you knew how much I've lost, you'd have no problem with me winning
How many times could I be reinvented?
Money is the deadlier of the five venoms, in my denim
Definitively got a wad in 'em, garages with cars in 'em
Hanging out in bars to have menages with bartenders
God was an artist and Jesus was a carpenter
They put me together like an easel in the darkness of hell
And lost it and left me some loose screws, but
These are the nails to your coffin
These are the folk tales of a starving artist
Battling demons through his notepad like Adam and Eve eating kale in the garden
Flying private away from all charges
You want what for Christmas?! Hell no
What you mean 'this is all we got'?
That's it

It's Christmas time in the Montgomery home
Daddy's actin' all crazy again
Momma got herself a bloody nose
Daddy slapped her in the face again
Why they always gotta fight so much? Damn, Momma face swole
Me and my bros in a panic state
If that's the case yo, I can't just stay around this
Everything was fine, we just had dinner, we got all the He-Mans
Battle Cat, Adam and Cringer, even Castle Greyskull and Snake Mountain
Now we sit and listen to y'all argue about how y'all planned this day
And y'all just admitted to us Santa fake so Kid Vishis just ran away poutin'
Now I gotta go and console him, he wasn't nothin' but a spoiled little boy then
Little naive with an innocent cry, all he ever wanted to do was fit in with us
And y'all bought him a pair of fake Timberlands and put 'em in a real Timberland box
I never forget them boots, they was called Rugged Outbacks
Momma went and found them at Payless and made us promise not to say nothin'
Then Pop came in like he ain't know nothin' about it
Like, "Judy you gon' send that boy out in public like that?"
"He'll be just fine, these kids ain't 'bout to be
Looking down at his feet for no tree", and she really meant that
Meanwhile, this little arrogant nigga called himself stuntin' on me and Greg with him
Talkin' about, "Where your Timbs at?"
But he was too young to detect sarcasm so we was like, "Nigga, where yo' Timbs at?"

It's Thanksgiving in the Montgomery home
Greg just came in here drunk again
Now momma tryna cover for him
She afraid my daddy gon' punch him again
Why you gotta get drunk so much? Damn!
I wish you would just stay where you was at
Instead of coming home all rude and disrespectin' all our father's rules and shit, man
The mood done switched me and Vishis playing Connect Four
Our favorite movie just came on the tube and it's ironic it's "Bloodsport"
And I'm looking at Frank Dux and shit, thinkin' you should split
Before Daddy come down these stairs of this basement and see you wasted
But he just cut me off like, "That nigga ain't gon' do shit"
But the truth is this, he couldn't whoop my dad even if he was sober
I know cause he tried once
Ended up unconscious, a broke arm and a tooth was chipped
My big bro got a lot of emotional problems, he feel that we was all abused as kids
He saw momma get dragged down all kinds of stairs like a ragdoll when he was two
And this is back when Daddy used to sniff cocaine, poor thang
He had to be subjected to this when he gets drunk, he gets to losing it
He gets the illusion that he gon' protect us all from the Big Bad Wolf
Stand up to him and prove some shit
But all he really doing is stressing mom out
Got her goin', "Boy, you know your daddy up there asleep
The food is ready, why don't you stop
Making all this noise and let him stay 'sleep?"

The turkey's done in the Montgomery home
Dad has just been awakened again (uh-oh)
Greg is making all kinds of noise
Daddy's on his way angry again
"Who is that making all that God damn noise?" (not me)
"Greggy, get up here! You been out there drinking again?
What the fuck I tell you about coming in my house with this disrespectful shit?
Nigga where the fuck you done been?"
I'm thinking to myself "Greg please don't say nothin' stupid, man"
Every time my daddy in his drawers and he standing in the hallway
Mad at somebody, I swear to God he got the same strength as Superman
My brother turned around and just walks in the kitchen
Without even givin' an answer with his back to him like, "I ain't gotta talk to you nigga"
"Nigga, you don't hear me talking to you?"
Next thing my brother did is something that when it comes to my father is something you just don't do
He looked him right in his eyes and he asked him
"What the fuck is you gon' do?" (Mm, mm, mm)
My father hit him so hard his body hit the stove
The oven door hit the fucking floor
The turkey fell out the oven whole and landed near the stairs
Now Daddy standing over Greg
Talkin' 'bout, "Nigga, you ain't hurt! Get up, get up!"
And here come Vish' talkin' 'bout, "Dad, I don't think he gon' get up"
Then momma went damn near hysterical
She called the police, the police came
Neighbors is all in the street
Watching the cops takin' my father out in handcuffs
Damn, man that shit was real embarassing
To all my friends I grew up with, who grew up fatherless
I know through me you live vicariously
I want you to know that we ain't know better than you and yours
We all needed therapy
We care about each other more
Than we care about if anybody understands us
What I'm tryin' say is "Fuck you!"
And Happy Holidays from the Montgomery family

Every man reaches that point in life
Where he don't want to make excuses no more more
Life took me on a rollercoaster ride
I've been up, I've been down, all the ribbons and my daddy game
Took me on highs
Turned around and then took me on lows (that's how the story goes)
Ohh, then I think about it
I use that shit as fuel
Then I changed it into power, now can't you feel it?
Can't you feel it?
That I'm a grown man with power, yeah, let me hear you say "yeah"
If you was raised in a strict home like me, felt alone like me
And it gave you power, ooohh
You can do it too, just look at me
See I'm a grown man with power, yeah, everybody say "yeah"
If you don't know the meaning of abusive
You've been through so much ain't nothing nobody can do to you
Now can't you feel it? I'm a runaway
This is how I became, a grown man with power
Ooohh, you can do it too, if I can do it
Use this power, I was a runaway, I was a runaway
There ain't nothing none of you can do to me, do to me

When you were a child growing up with Grandad and Granny
Did you really feel like Grandad was a good father to you?
Absolutely, absolutely
All my friend's daddies was walking out on them left and right
Y'know he never left us, he was always there for us
Y'know there were a lot of things that happened that I didn't understand
Maybe I might not have answered the question the same way when I was a teenager
But I understand and appreciate him so much more now as a man
Y'know 'cause he taught me respect and discipline
And consequences for your acts, so yeah, of course
Do you think his approach as a father
Really shaped the type of father that you are today
Or do you in some ways think it had negatives to it
And if so, what kind of negative traits
Do you try to avoid having as a father right now, to me?
(When you have your own, you'll understand)
The separation of talent and skill is one of the greatest misunderstood concepts for people who are trying to excel, who have dreams, that want to do things. Talent you have naturally. Skill is only developed by hours and hours and hours of beating on your craft


I've been killing microphones, killing microphones
I've been killing microphones, killing microphones
Nigga, I've been killing microphones, killing microphones
Killing microphones, killing microphones

I been like the zone
When you talk to me minimize your tone
Take some of that bass out your voice
Don't go and put your Energizer on
With this beat I'm going all the way
I don't mean to the end of night, come on
I mean I'mma take it to the grave, untilI end your life it's on
I'm talking about cracker-jacking these niggas
'Til their whole enterprise is gone
I'm talking about clapping at these niggas
With some shit that's gonna feminize you strong
I'm talking about tenderize the bone
I ain't talking about weird science though
When I say that my ceiling is probably gone
I'm talking about villainizing your home
Nigga, I been in like the zone
I'm looking like Rambo in this bitch
But nigga, I ain't feeling like Stallone
Feel more like I'm in a heist alone
Look, I don't like to aim my shit at any artist
When I'm writing I'm just generalizing
How am I gon' take a shot at something
I can't even fucking identify with?
I'm feeling like the long days away from feeling my Patrón
Used to have the coldest bitches waiting for me
Chilling by the phone
Used to do donuts on the grass
Now I'm just feeling like a drone
'Cause even though I'm sitting high somewhere
I'm still spinning by your home, bitch


I've been killing microphones, bitch, killing microphones, bitch
I've been killing microphones, killing microphones
Nigga, I've been killing microphones, killing microphones
Killing microphones, killing microphones

This a new life, who this? This a new phone, who this?
I'm in a new zone, who this? This ain't no Redbone and who this
I'm sorry, my top is unavailable right now
My roof gone, who this?
Nigga, my taste amazin, my chick look like the waitress from Hooters
And she about to fix me dinner
She independent, but she into niggas that's big spenders
And I'm into fitting this dick in her
And she into fitness like Brittany Renner
I used to chase the liquor with the Guinness
Move-making, nigga, with the business
With the winners in the bed with two majors
I still wake up feeling independent
I'm a savage, on top of that I'm a reckless product of D&D
Stop critiquing me, my detractors
Just couldn't sell a record to the DMV
I'm somebody, ain't nobody better than
My precise knowledge and intelligence
Well advanced, I swipe a knife across your white collar like a cheddar scam
I put your lights out like Edison
Ain't nobody out there ready for him
My blood type B positive, your type O like the credits wrong
I'm immune to all medic-on, blue Ferrari head is gone
Went from palladiums to colosseum stadiums
You perform in the Reddit forum
I spot a bitch nigga like Cyclops on Santa Monica
Got a model blowing my mind
My new Monica is blowing my harmonica
The car odometer is on the bottom
Of all the numbers like you dial star pound
Or put the car around white walls
Call 'em fire marshalls to come and shut the party down
I'm the leader of CMB, doing 52 over speed bumps
In front of your table with TMZ doin interviews while you eat lunch
I deal with mics real Kendrick-like, I'll kill a mic
Cash rules everything around me until I die
Looking right into the vanilla sky
I'm funny acting "who this?"
You owe me money, run me that or do this
Get a running start, jump into a hole, take a hole in that beluga
I act like them older cats with moola
Dragging motorcycles past the light
With Kodiak on that Patrón, I'm hot and on cognac, I'm cooler
And I'mma show no reaction to your rollie flashing like my zodiac a jeweler
Ain't nothing but a dead something, I be headhunting, yeah, I'm going for that medulla
Boo-yah, don't be acting foolish
Baby, this a new phone, you yapping "who this?"
Maybe everything I'm gon' say from here on then is gon' be on the behalf of "who this?"
(Hello) This a new life, who this?
I'm on a roll like two dice moving
I'm on a boat in Dubai fooling
On the moped flute-by shooting
I'm an unapologetic work in progress
Product of a hard-working dedicated father with shortcomings
Praying all his sons make it farther
People say that it make you softer to raise a daughter, but it made me harder
Smarter with the way I make dollars just to make sure she stay a baby baller
The way I zone is like the AC on
I play like KC and KG, you can't even cage me
I be using Windows like I'm on a HP
Just look around, I don't own a thing that ain't in HD
I ain't interested in the crown that don't belong to Wayne, Shady or Jay Z
That's a opposite
You don't like your life, how about death?
You don't like to fight, how about sex?
You don't like the kind of car you drive, okay, how about Bow Wow's jet?
I got the kind of flow that destroy the place though
How about you take your shot at Rihanna like I did when I said "hi"?
Or how about with Soulja Draco?
How about I come through and paint the floor with your whole crew?
How about the coroner come through and tell you go get Maaco
How about I don't give a fuck about burning bridges?
How about I walk through the fire 'cause I'm hot and I got the golden gate flow?
How about I box?
How about like Argyle
I sock niggas and give 'em disease like a irock
How about I hop out the Maybach and challenge every living emcee?
Shoot 
Trust the fuckin' shooter

Being feared goes farther than any part of me having respect does
So I play to the tune of my own eardrum
While I'm out on my quest, love
I don't speak on behalf of myself, but my impeccable rep does
Christmas morning I remember waking up wishin' I could just go to sleep
Cause we only got like two toys a piece
I ask my pops did he do more for me?
He said "yes, I got you clothes and heat
And let you keep a whole two rows of teeth"
Ha, I'm royalty
I took whoopings, I took losses, but no defeats
Been dropped, and been shelved with no release
Been in jail, no commissary or relief
But God looks over me like a cross and rosary
Rifle in hand, I let niggas have it, I won't hesitate
Writes on the cans in the cabinet "section eight"
My son got on them three-fifty boots Kanye West is dressed in bape
Askin' me questions 'bout gettin' to second base
Uhh, wifey textin' SMH, house phone ringin' off the hook
Conference calls from record labels, guess I'm late
But, my other son's autistic, he wants my attention
This might just be my defining moment, let them wait

It's my time now, nigga; let them wait
Pick up the phone, tell 'em hold; let them wait
Old friends comin' to they senses tryna' reconcile
After I fell out with them, well fuck them niggas; let them wait

Wait, I'm here for that green, for that mula
You scheme, I see right through ya
I'm regal like a Akeem, father King of Zamunda
One thing's for sure I think they do know
That me, and Porter, and Jake Uno
We don't play no games, no, we play sumo
We attempt to flatten into action
With all these average, flacid defenseless rappers
I have no problem killing like sent assassins
They temper's bad when my temper's graphic
They hide or they fly while I'm high and flyer
I'm intergalactic, I've been spectacular
Flippin' like I invented spatulas, my lyrics is futuristic
I'm in here with my vintage ratchet with prints and scratches
My mental action-ly incapacitates fast as my passion
And pen surpasses my Aston
And leave a skid road in the street like I'm into smackin'
I fill my engine with acid
With my finger wrapped around a hair-trigger that resembles lashes
I get into bitches quick and then I get distracted
I'm like the stock market, just like that, my interest crashes
Like a cymbal, my symbol should be expensive glasses
She with me, she a afro-centric nympho chick with a ass did
She callin' me back-to-back for a second date
While my ex is callin' for make-up-dick -- let them wait
Money all over the ground like Scotty from New Jack City, I weapon wave
Everybody, step away
They said that we should go our separate ways, in high school Now they wanna jump the line in my shows -- let them wait
My whole life, they pressured me -- let them wait
You rushin' me you rushin' excellence -- let them wait
Police in my rear-view mirror with they sirens on
But I'ma call my lawyer first 'fore I pull over -- let them wait

It's my time now, nigga, let them wait
Pick up the phone, tell them hold, let them wait
Old friends comin' to they senses tryna' reconcile
After I fell out with them, well fuck them niggas; let them wait
Yeah
Yeah
808 Mafia

I've been had the moves (been had the moves)
I got the moves since I got my studio (I got my studio)
I got confused (Hella confused)
I can't figure out for the life of me how I can lose
(how can I lose?)
How I can lose? (how can I lose?)
But I've been had moves (I got the moves)

I got I Decided on pre order, my lil homie just went gold
I hock a loogie on a reporter, Detroit is on Pete Rose
That's Armstrong on steroids, gated up no wing toes
My phones blowing up so much a nigga may end up like Cee-Lo
I bounce back like the fattest ass you can have attached to the fattest hips and anything after this shall be considered cataclysmic
Countin' packs like a statisician
Emphatic charisma
Savage enigma
I have a religion to handle your rhythm like cannibalism
The camera rollin' and it's time to flow
I don't know
I just go carnival
I'm from Motown you know
I can just line up the hollow tips inside the clip
And I can just go down the road
And knock 'em down like some dominoes
After you already out then I'm dropping some more like you 2Pac and the commandos
Watching my comments like papparazi watching Sasha Obama grow
I got Elijah Mohammed glow
I got the dough these rappers claim they got at the house in my drawer in the envelope
My focus phenomenal
My temperature so hot and cold I broke the thermometer
Guarantee I will kill the flow
This remind me of LaLa Anthony ass in that New Edition movie
Niggas tryin' to cover it up and make her look old
Guarantee I'mma still steal the show
I been had the moves
I remember these bitches was just a dream
Actresses and models I used to only see on television
Now they be climbin' out of my television lookin' at me to get the ring
I remember all I used to be around is dudes that used to try to just kill by me
Choppin' and conceal bodies
Used to clean up the bloody mess up in front of me
I had to holla at a tube
I had to still deal with that field sobriety
Had to do a double take at the dirty mop when he was finished
Looked like Lil Yachty
Nigga, I went to jail for the whole year
I got out and I did the same thing you wack ass rappers do when y'all got your little show here
I came right out to booze/boo's
Straight right out the news
Right off the cover of a magazine
Had the magazine with me at the club showing people like "Look at this and please try not to drool"
I fuck a Stacy thick ass for all the days she used to make me work
And Tracy slick ass but not before I fuck April first
Translation I'm bout to fool
Y'all countin' me out well I got you
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, here I count for you
Biiitch

Last time took an 'L', now it's time to bounce back
(I been had the moves)
I was broke as hell, now it's time to bounce back
(I got the moves)
Every time I fail I got up and bounced back
(I been had the moves)
And nothing y'all can tell me about that bounce back


I’m doing this cause this what God want me to do
These lyrics is ordained by the Lord
You gon' get these bars
For free

It’s bad half and finally famous
The weapon’s Iranian
Y’all niggas is Pomeranian
My damie y’all Pootie Tang
Nigga I’m Damien
Shots drop from out of my cranium
My mind is Lebron drainin’ em
Five finger ring titanium
Already in your top 5
Now my dingaling now dangling
I’m flyer than Tom Chambers on the first NBA Live
Double pumping from the three point NBA line
On that war page with that 24 gauge
But when I double pump it I’m prime Chamberlain
Every track on the record got a background message
“We don’t back down ever!”
I’m putting the autobiographical book out with the Book of Ryan
I just let my bitch in LA read, now that sounds epic
My mind carries words
You couldn’t walk a mile in my patent leather Larry Bird black con weapons
I hope you know theres more fish that’s in the sea
I stole ya ho, we been kissing like we been sitting in a tree
And these ho’s in Detroit be trickin’ sooo much
They can completely gooo up a magician’s sleeve
You’re totally awesome
While I pour 40’s on corners for those we lost
My soul suffers from holy exhaustion
Trippin’ on opium just to cope with openin’ coffins
The devil sittin’ close enough to me to quote me an offer
Keep the union in unison like the Soviet’s marching
We goin’ iron for iron like a trophy in golfing
My nigga, better yet, I feel like the only man who can understand me is Sloth from The Goonies
Cause he retarded as fuck, on a boat with a treasure chest
That makes perfectly good sense
That’s exactly how my career went
Like a fuckin’ experiment
I got a lot on my mind that I gotta deal with
First of all, my favorite uncle died and favorite auntie died
I missed both of they funerals fuckin’ around with rappers
So every day and every night my conscience cries
I’m stressed out because my moms be tired, pops be workin’
And Lord knows I done threw enough dollars on the floor in the past for moms to retire
That’s why I be in the lab and my mind be wired
Trying to figure it out fast before my time expires
Man, but it’s this one thing that always on my fucking mind and it haunts me constantly guys
And that’s why in the fuck have I not at least tried to get in between Ashanti’s thighs
I’m feeling like a straight sucker I faced the vibration
My sober, righteous life only got a place for my lady
But maybe I can ask my lady for permission
She can give me a hall pass like Jason Sudeikis
This audio porn I’m giving with a bit of sense
A mind fuck if you will
I’m from Detroit but if I send you to the store with a large bill for some little shit
Bitch, I was born by a river in a little tent
Now I just ride with six vehicles with an ill tint
I’m cut from the kind of cloth that’ll never go outta style
With or without the internet my shit’ll still trend
That’s why I’m still standing with everything I came with
Cool as a Jacuzzi everything in me is built in
Nah, I don’t borrow I’d rather discuss loaning
I’m ready to go to war with whoever the fuck want it
Y’all weigh your respect against your release date
I’m just an artist dog I don’t know how to be fake
I don’t want no problems dog
I don’t wanna be apart of nothing with lies involved
I don’t want no phone that receives a thousand calls
I don’t need to be around a thousand smiling broads
With they hands out
Probably couldn’t survive without em all
But they can’t vouch for who the next sucker
(Ryan) Never would have made it
Now I'm glad I make it out
It's God speed
It's God, yeah
It's God speed
It's God, ahhhh

Uh, this is just how I zone when Porter spaz
I was born at a quarter past
I was the color purple, Mom and Pop took me home in a Crown Royale bag
Now I'm the hottest nigga that you know with the coldest intentions
Uh, all I know is this flow and this pencil
The Lord is my shepherd, the Devil's my Doberman Pinscher
The industry said I had to be an alcoholic
Who be havin' threesomes, be doin' acid and havin' seizures
Wish I could go back to my old school and slap the teachers
All I had to do to blow up was an album packed with features?
I don't relate to common folk, they focus on the comments so
I'ma go roll a Testarossa down the coast of Monaco
Lo and behold, your honorable
Niggas is sheep, niggas is sleep, 'bout as woke as a dinosaur
My connect'll give you a whole kilo of coke so he can go Geronimo
He should receive a trophy for bein' the holy Jesus of flows
He the G.O.A.T., baaah
That should be my, taaaag
I'm from the streets where the odds are not even
Robbery, thievin', ballers, debauchery, schemin'
Allah and Jesus, it's hard to believe I'm a product of Eve
In the garden of Eden, speakin', how targeted we been?
Rihanna stalker, I'm parked in her DMs
Shark in the deep end, put the paws on you, I soften your defense
Hit your pause button, halt your critiquin'
Talk is cheap, the more you niggas talk it, it cheapens
And all I see is prayer 'round the streets today
I'm about a freak away from havin' Issa Rae eatin' out LisaRaye
Any artist out that you see is great, tell 'em I said bring his ass
Better bring his A, let his single play
We don't care what you sing, hit you in the face with the butt of the gun
You leak and get your street cred and a few streams
Pop go the weasel, nigga
Fiva Nina, I'm the illest, you got pop culture fever, nigga
All I know is Big and Pac quotes, pop toast and squeezin' triggers, speedin' tickets
Now I'm pullin' cops over, give them niggas season tickets
Teesha used to shoot me down vicious, now she the missus
She turned me to a family guy quicker than Peter Griffin
I told myself when I was 14 that she the one
Now a nigga probably got more seeds than Peter Gunz
Now I go out to get my groceries in two-seaters
Used to roll the old school, four speakers and two tweeters
Ridin' with nothing but raw quarterpacks and duffels
Ryan writes heaters
Y'all niggas is cut like one them "Get Rich or Die Tryin'" wife-beaters
Me? I'm just all shoulder straps and muscle
If you a hater, let's do it, I whip you now then whip on your boy later
Them whippins'll go around like a tornado
I get rid of more yayo
I don't do Rodeo or ales, I do the Floyd May-o's
So many men shopping the women's section, it ain't no ladies left
These niggas crazy? Yes
They playin' crazy like the Chappelle sketch, Wayne Brady ep
I'm what you get when Freeway Rick and Cocaine 80's met
Bringin' bars back to the streets like Jay and Nas beef
Broadcastin' "Ether" in HD at God speed
Security, yeah, yeah
Security

Let me tell y’all a story about somebody I feel was a gangsta
And that’s the very same reason he ain’t here with me no more

He marched around the corner like a soldier
But not to get no on-the-mic exposure
To question me, I guess he checking me
I’m feeling like I’m looking at my own self in the face
As deaths destiny awaits us both wearing vests’s
Us both stressed from the same pressures
Us both fucking train-wreck reckless
Guns whip out, he had a .9, I had a .40
I remember a point in time where he had mine
I had his shorty and I could cry telling this story
If you can visualize a downtown crowded street, somebody was eating
And saw P pull out his piece and decided to reach (Security)

Police rolled up on like "Police freeze!!" (Security)
Cuffed us up like nothing (Security, yeah, yeah)
Asked us what we got guns for, we told ‘em it’s for (Security)
(Proof, this one’s for you, I love you Doody)


He marched up out his house like a soldier
Decided to titty-bar it
A lot of alcohol consumption and drug use
While out with the city’s hardest, niggas
Throwing money up with black face, flicking photos
The only thing he was missing was my nigga Dolo
He decided to leave them and go to an after-hour
After the 4-hour, he act crazier than Scarface after snorting powder
He get into it with this dude, point his piece at him
They say he shot him, problem is, I don’t believe that
And on the real I, only know shots flew
And when the smoke cleared they say he got killed by (Security)

Shot my nigga like that, that (Security)
Probably shoulda watched his back (Security, yeah, yeah)
It’s fucked up, right? (Security)
(Proof, this one’s for you, I love you Dudey)


I know y’all seen Beef III
And it probably made you think that I ain’t like Shady
The truth is, I was at Proof's funeral
Crying like a baby, I was sitting in the back row
With Vishis, wishing I can go up to Marshall
Denaun, Swifty, Obie, Bizarre, Paul and Von
And say something positive, after all the negative shit
That we been through, thinking we’d talk one day
If it was meant to reservations ’bout walking up there
And getting in the way, it’s probably better off to just pray
Thinking my niggas a Don, it was my first time
At an over 1000 people funeral with (Security)

R.I.P (Security)
We love you, P (Security, yeah, yeah)
R.I.P (Security)
(Proof, this one’s for you, I love you Dudey)
Oh yes
This one's for those of you just ain't woke yet, hotep
You rich but you broke nigga just don't know yet, hotep
These rappers ain't woke yet, security back 'em, hotep
Hotep, come to Detroit with that, oh yes, that's a toe tag
Might as well have Mayweather back ya at a Black's match-up, protest
That's that "Write a check you can't cash," I might have to collect
That's that yo ass is bleeding, that's that Kotex
I massacre your whole rap allegiance, oh yes
This one's for little bro who big bro ain't come back from the store yet
Hotep, I'm here for blessings sent my direction, no less
This one's for those who don't know they pops not invincible yet
Trick bitches hoes that don't know just how nasty they are
They out here wearin' the same tongue ring they ain't change from ten dicks ago yet
Hopefully that scope on that AR don't take my focus
To places where I put fakers in comas longer than daytime soapas
Any calendar day I'll Halloween like late October
I'll bury these niggas up under the Devil's playground, playtime's over
Your bitch fine, dawg, I can't deny it
She tryna be my wife on the side, I ain't invited
I just, step over the ring and hit the bitch like Andre the Giant
Papa used to beat on me often for not being perfect
Thots used to call me tar baby, cops taught me that I'd be worthless
Mama gave birth to only one dark child like Rodney Jerkins
That taught me to focus on what's inside y'all and not the surface
I know my streets, I know my sounds
Y'all know my beats, how I get down
I take my steps, and leaps and bounds
Nigga it's hip hop

Yeah, yeah, we started from nothing a couple MCs
Beat-boxin', the crowd in the lunch room
Me and Preem, both names go together
Like they ain't supposed to be separate like D&D
I said it before, I rep in records beats
At the HeadQCourterz, rest in peace
Nigga I'mma hold shotty, and knock you out
And I ain't gotta know karate like Afu-Ra
It's hip hop, strong or not
This is rap basketball, stats all you got
Long as you hot, and your flow can hold up
To knowing that all of your short goals is long shots!
Ninety percent of you niggas ain't hard
Here just to get a rep, you not Gang Starrs
The finest flow will amaze
Rap without me is The Source minus the quotable page

Hip hop is everything around you
No competition
Back to the voice of today
It's real in the field
What's realer than hip hop?
I know my streets, I know my sound
Y'all know my beats, how I get down
I take my steps, and leaps and bounds, nigga it's hip hop

Rhythmically come on with it, I'm long-winded
I will diss you from long distances
You will not get the chance like Choppa
Ness and Dylan to disrespect, who you don't listen to
Egg in the skillet brain, nigga, this is you
Smarten up, every person in the Earth
Be hardened up but the only target is us
It's hip hop, cars and trucks
I be dreaming about shit like having a hard time swinging
On a nigga or squeezing a trigger or falling
If I land I won't wake up
My six shot model, ya crew
I'm leavin' ya momma faces blue like a Hpnotiq bottle
They feel you the realer you spit, this killer shit is hearin' us
Healin' you if you ill or you sick mentally, it's

Hip hop is everything around you
Gotta be something for me to write this
Back to the voice of today
No talent rappers
What's realer than hip hop?
I know my streets, I know my sounds
Y'all know my beats, how I get down
I take my steps, and leaps and bounds
Nigga it's hip hop!

More venom, 5’9” is like a G5
Illest lyrics is stored in him
Chorus is killing, any warrior feeling
That I ain't God - Lord willing
Trust me after I crush ya building
You will just hush, you won't restore the village
We look toward with killing, real
Though this album is mor-bidly feeling to steel
Hip hop! Fuck your feelings
More rappers dying, much more killing
It's no feeling realer than gambling ya life
Everyday, and waking up to more dealings
Fourteen killings compared to offshore millions
Equals I got a lot more villians
You know that you easily lose, you be on MTV News
For the first time, because you died over

Hip hop is everything around you
Come alive y'all
Back to the voice of today
It's all in the game
What's realer than hip hop?
I know my streets, I know my sounds
Y'all know my beats, how I get down
I take my steps, and leaps and bounds
Nigga it's hip hop!
(Hold up!)
Presenting to you, the President of the United States
The bullet being lodged an inch away from his heart, Reagan is launched into the operating room, and tells his doctors, ‘I hope you’re all Republicans.’

Cash rules everything around me
I ain’t claiming I’m street
I’m just saying everything that surrounds me is concrete
In the bubble-eyed ride all because I bubble like Don P
Right beside me’s a dime piece, college girl looking ‘bout as good as I sleep
That’s cause I keep it low, the opposite of high key
Y’all niggas got the wrong idea ‘bout what’s really going on, out here
Y’all weird, I see, they told you, ‘Keep your ears to the streets’
Y’all niggas laying down and y’all ears out here in these streets
I guess you took it literal
Guess the only code you live by’s forget-it-code
Uh, if I should get my own guilty verdict
May the next man learn from it, then flourish
You could put it on the news, you could put my face on the front of a shirt, then the latest video, then blur it
Y’all niggas fucking with the next nigga, bitch
Mostly attracted to her cause she the next nigga bitch
One of my niggas made a name for killing niggas
Now he on the slayin' spree for Dilla niggas, I call it the nigga nitch
Life is set up for you to dig a ditch
God is looking down on all, being carried by the crisp pallbearers
Like, just ball, player
You ain’t even gotta pull a trigger, you can still assist
Imma keep it real as this

Got to know when to row from the madness
Got to know when to give these niggas passes
Got to know when to hold ‘em and when to fold ‘em
Got to know when to beats niggas asses
Got to know when the money ain’t good money
Got to know when somebody ain’t good for ya’
Got to know when to open and when to close
When being silent exposes, and when it’s golden
Got to know all the got to knows
Got to know all the got to knows

God made us niggas, then made us all breakable
Then gave us all decision making that’ll make or break a nigga
People tryna blaze with you, just so they can lace a nigga
All because of public sensationalism
With brothers with faces that people see and can relate to
When the place where the foundation of eating’s
Higher population is based on popularity
Gotta be careful where you place your wisdom
All it takes is just one conversation where you unbeknownst to the fact you’re talking to an abomination
At the wrong place, at the wrong time, with the wrong crime taking place
That’ll put you away for a long grind, where it’s locked
Where it’s not safe unless you know them combinations
Yeah, it’s just a way a man to be taken by the same thing that took his brother
We don’t learn from each other, we learn to look the other
Way when one of us in trouble
That karma looking to catch you, it’s patient
It’ll wait till you think you would love to come get you
Cause  it know that women been the downfall of men ever since pussy was discovered
Dearly beloved, you soul searching for nothing
Just follow the instincts the lord versed you with, historically
That feeling that you get in your gut been getting ignored more than that poor person
Who’s living under the gun in this cold, cold world that we live in
That’s under the imminent control of the consumer and indigenous war merchants
More religion and more churches, doctors, more nurses
Cause it’s the American way to make anything that’ll finish you or drop you, for purchase
Who said I couldn’t buy my way into heaven?
All I need is a bottle, a couple dollars, a couple people that’ll keep me company
And who love misery as much as me
You got to know your pedigree, got to be yourself at all times
Your true self at all times ain’t gon hesitate to let you know when you should let it be
A lot of these brothers done died tryna follow their pride
Gotta know the alert signs, them butterflies as reliable as your first mind, genetically

Got to know when to row from the madness
Got to know when to give these niggas passes
Got to know when to hold ‘em and when to fold ‘em
Got to know when to beats niggas asses
Got to know when the money ain’t good
Got to know when somebody ain’t good for ya’
Got to know when to open and when to close
When being silent exposes, and when it’s golden
Got to know all I got to know
Got to know all I got to know
Yeah, now you see what the Lord doin'
Rippin' pages out the book, I had to make the story fluent
Thanks to Marshall, I'm sober doin' what I enjoy doin'
I'm puttin Chavis Chandler on, had to at least pay it forward to him
Yeah, every other day another star is born
And that's to freshen the decayin' of the art form
Fuck with my commas, shit will be quick
Got what's in my pocket out of the dirt, filthy rich
I stuck to my promise to momma, stay focused
Double entendre, I'm tryna vocally smoke you, you will be missed
The hocus, the pocus, magician doing tricks in his miserable business
Who spit, loyalty, forgiveness through biblical scripts
Of morals and wisdom, paintin' pictures of this
Historical war of attrition who's just, the dopest, the wokest
I'm five years sober
Trauma from my childhood constantly haunts me 'til I finally cry tears over
Sharp as a gauntlet, with thoughts of my side chick in high heels
Cause I didn't want her, I needed her, though I didn't want her
I'm hot as July, no lie, I wouldn't lie in a sauna
Invest in the truth, don't expect me to buy into moments
They done took the charts over so now y'all scared of them shook niggas?
Jamal Crawford couldn't crossover and sell me them Wolf tickets

Uhh, "Best Rapper Alive" broadcasts in five
Four, three, two, one

I’m fly as a dive in the sky in a harness
Anyone alive sleepin' on me can die in pajamas
Police call me a threat to society, though I am a promise
I am a one-of-one like I’d say a Isaiah Thomas
You can’t fathom thinking deep enough to sink the abyss
You think you Pac, I’m thinkin' of sinkin' your Demetrius Shipp
Only thing that I can’t fathom is why the preacher is rich
How to think in the moderation and turn a drink to a sip
I'm private when I fly, I ball out like 'Bron do
You in the game but you sit and coach like Tyronn Lue
Me and my soldiers, we just out here mobbin' like old Italians
I'm snatching your homie's necklace to rock it with your medallion
Over these groceries, I’m toe-to-toe with your whole battalion
I hit you with four from this .44 like Hova album
I take lives like banned contracepts
All the contraband I collect is Iran contra-esque
Respect the mantra or die at the hands of consciousness
Run up and get left ran down to death on your damn conscious steps
The booze already made me lose, I can't go out like I’m Amy Winehouse
The Lord graciously still kept me here in a place to be
On the corner like baby Blue standin' in timeout
Looking real spiritually aware, pair of Pumas on
Looking like I’m aboard a Lear, headed to uniform
I’m so lyrically rare, I spearheaded the unicorn

I was born a bold one, sugar-coated on
The way I'm livin' put me in a great position now
Every time they hear me, they say, "Ain't nobody did this, nah"
And if they don't, they shit been off, just listen to the diction in this lyricism
I won't break a fool, they don't want me to blow
But every single show, they hand out like I owe 'em
Already paid my dues and wordings, uh
But if I said it then they still won't know, so I won't waste my time on you
And speakin' on the level that ya never on, the way they hatin' so incredible
My writings on the wall, to you, it's so illegible
I'm invincible, you're sleepin' on me, I'ma stay woke
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
We holla at 'em like

These niggas talkin' bout they walk, talk, and think bossy
I'm in the Trump Tower shower washin' ink off me
Two ugly bitches in my bed, moochin' drinks off me
My mini bar's empty, but that's just how I'm livin'
I'm in the presidential suite with two freaks
I call 'em my Kennedy Fried Chickens "Aww, yeah, I'm back, bitches"
But this is, kinda like my wilder style, vicious
Say when I'm sippin', I turn into Shallow Hal
I must have been high or somethin' cause I could of swore
That one of these bitches told me to buy her somethin'
I told her "I got a present for you right here"
(What?) "Actually it's not a present, it's my penis"
I'm feelin' plastered, so what they fat women
I feel like I have to bite the Apple like the Mac emblem
One of the bitches like, "Oh, I love you so much
I love Slaughterhouse, I love Joey, Joell, Crooked, all you guys"
Shut up "I don't like it when you talk" (What?)
"Cause that just means you're not suckin' my cock"
Bitch I'm on everything, I don't know what you just had
I'm 'bout to slip and fall and head butt your ass like Superbad
One of 'em started suckin' me super fast, the other one
I gave Arabian Goggles, they flier than alien model, for now
These bitches givin' me brains until I'm out of mines
That's when I had an epiphany like (Stop!) Vagina time

"Vagina" (What?) "Vagina" (What?)
"I wanna have sex with your vagina"
"Vagina" (What?) "Vagina" (What?)
"E=MC Vagina" (Come on)

(We holla at 'em like) I swear these little punks be wildin'
Claimin' they only fuck bad bitches, chopper stylin'
I be swimmin' in trash bitches goin' dumpster divin'
I met a bitch on the street, she said she want a nigga that's deep
I'm deep, I said "I'm the Indian Jones of explorin' crotch
I'm the Shakespeare of enormous cock"
I told her I got an 'oh so flow mean', rope-a-dope? Nope
I got a Poconos swing, little bitch riddle me this (Come on)
"What's the difference between a girl's mouth and a girl's vagina?"
(What?) "There is none, I want my penis to inside both of those things"
I know you gazin' at the words I text
I ain't a virgin, your wife ain't the first bird I pecked
She ain't per-fect, she per-plexed, she can't quite think
Your baby girl ain't right like birth defects
My religion is God body gynecology
I work with sex, feelin' no pain like Percocets
Sellin' syrup and wet in church and sweat
You herb niggas got me twisted like cursive text
Nigga I cling to her, I'll give her hella smoke
I'll sing to her, I'll tell her hella jokes like
"Why did my penis cross the road?"
(What?) "To get to the other vagina"

"Vagina" (What?) "Vagina" (What?)
"I wanna have sex with your vagina"
"Vagina" (What?) "Vagina" (What?)
"2 + 2 = Vagina" (Come on)
We holla at 'em like

"My dick is like an airplane, it gives girls orgasms
I'm the Wayne Gretzky of sexual stuff
I'm the, Hulk Hogan of slammin' muff
Love is for girls and gays (What?)
If you wanna be with me it goes one of two ways
Either you have sex with me, or you have sex with me
Girls love my sex, I'm a good sex man
Cause my sex is the best, I'm like Jean Claude Van Damme
But instead of fight people, I have sex with them"
(Let us pray)
Dear Heavenly Father, thank You for watching over us today. I pray for the sick and  and for those who have lost loved ones. Lord, I pray for the homeless. Lord, I pray for our soldiers and their families. I pray for everyone here today...

God taketh away, and God giveth
The clock's tickin' away as the plot thickens today
Cause I'm sippin' hard liquor
We couldn't suffer the same amount of losses
Cause my supply's bigger
Don't associate me with nothin' but that dopest child star shit
That Lindsey Lo', that Todd Bridges
Hit your block with a tickin' bomb that'll
Leave the competition in hospital
I'm the product of foolish pride
I'm a speeding bullet who responds to the pull of God's trigger
Jumpin' out the barrel, like "Excuse me, Nas. Move aside, Jigga"
I'm hard as proving ground bricks
Groundbreaking each time I spit words and they hit the street
You don't like the game, you can google my dick, bitch

And that goes to everybody
I pray for foes, I pray for hoes
I pray for everybody
But you can pray for them
If you gon' pray for somebody, pray for them

Don't pray for me, pray for Paris
Pray for Nigeria, pray for peace
Pray for your marriage
Pray your horse don't sway far away from your carriage
Why you put all of your eggs in one basket?
Blowin' dumb cash on Wraiths and karats
Your daughter ain't an heiress, I hope she's taken care of
More importantly, I hope this gun in your face don't end up in your mouth
I'll make you taste the terror of the kickback of this gat that could break the barrel
More court cases, hate betrayal
If I approach thee, boy, please take me serious
Cause if I say that I shall, then I shall proceed
I don't cry wolf cause I don't enjoy wasting tears any more than I enjoy wasting shells
I looked at the state of my health and asked the reverend 'bout it
I didn't just pray for myself, I prayed for everybody

But you can pray for them
They need you more than me, pray for them
Pray for everybody

Look around, look around, look around, look around
Pray for everybody, tell me exactly what you're seeing
I'm seeing children being murdered by police and then acquitted on all charges
It's like they're all targets, pray for them
Pray for everybody

Live from the gutter, my father's a drugger
The block is my mother, 2Pac got it on lock in my suburb
I got dope double-wrapped up in bubble wrap on top of my cupboard
Old ladies watching from shutters
Tellin' all the children keep watching out for us
Bad influences, we the gumbo that you see inside the pot
Swimming 'round in all the saddest, truest shit
Addict in the coolest whip
Riding 'round my city lookin' for the baddest newest bitch
Hammer in my stash, feeling too legit
90 on the dash, slammin' on the gas
Passenger mad, saying that the break pedal do exist
I'm saying "I'm late man, I got school to skip"
Introduce me to your chick, I turn this shit to a Skip to My Lou assist
I don't talk too much shit, I discuss shit by throwing hands
I'm a sucker for hoes in yoga pants
Tell my queen I'm in this shit, like kissing and holding hands
I keep my flings on the other end of a string with swollen glands
I'm a player, I've been to every hotel and every lobby
Every time I pray, I send up a prayer for everybody

Don't pray for me, nigga
Pray for them
You gon' pray for somebody?
Pray for them

Don't pray for me, pray for respect
Pray to get something different from rich and away from your debt
Nigga, I'm straight to cassette
Y'all digital, y'all about as physical as finger under some balls, coughin' while taking a test
Too many artists get mistaken with best
Cause they on the charts, you sleepin' on me, I'll come and wake you to death
While I pray against all the violence and shootin'
ISIS got Obama sittin' down with Vladimir Putin
I saw a child online ask his father "Why did they do this?"
His father then replied to him, "We gotta fight 'em with flowers growing out the ground"
I look at violence the same way I look at slavery
It's never ending in light of abolishment
These are my finest hours, then
I pray for everybody

Look around, look around, look around, look around
Pray for everybody, tell me exactly what you're seeing
I'm seeing children being murdered by police and then acquitted on all charges
It's like they're all targets, pray for them

(Let us pray)
Lord, please keep Your arms around us, and protect us from harm and danger. In your son Jesus' name, amen. (Amen!)
I'm ridin' with the K solo, I'm spellbound
Used to ride with Delilah and Nicole in the Fairmount
I'm who incite the riot, you the guy at the staredown
I worked at Taco Bell, now I just fire the shell rounds
Now somewhere in the air lies the truth like a thunderstorm
I terrorize the youth as if I'm gunnin' for 'em
I could've jogged here, I marathon the booth and let it run its course
The R's here I'm paralyzin' you like the underscore
Your riders couldn't impress my chauffeurs
Your favorite artist couldn't benchpress my notebook
I transcend like Wu-Tang, the R era's cash rules
Now I'm just dead nice, the pallbearer of bad news
Shouts to all my niggas out there in the locks of crime
Remember they can lock your body but can't lock your mind
You lack triumph when you stop the grind
You rappers Blac Chyna, went and got your bread and went and got behind
Gun professor, I'll punch whoever
Come here lookin' like Conor McGregor
Leave this bitch lookin' like Uncle Fester
Question, are we bitter rivals?
'Cause we can shoot the Ks or the fade
'Til both of our arms get vitiligo
I stay in my prime, y'all niggas just sippin' on scotch
I stayed with my nine, y'all niggas just live with your pops
I sit in the original lyrical pivotal spot
Even though I changed with the time like digital clocks
Either goin' straight for the kill
Gun-slingin' or I'm goin' straight up Jada and Will, I come swingin'
I write for B.I.G. and 2Pac
I'm rollin' like the prices on the coupe dropped
I'm dolo like a sniper's on the rooftop
I'm sicker though, I'm feelin' like the flu shot
I shit on every artist on the charts and leave a diaper on the jukebox
My mind's like the Japan bullet train, it floats in cycles
Rhyme full of pain, spoken right out the smokin' rifle
They wanna see me tweetin', "Yo man, who need a feature?"
I'd rather squeeze until the Colt jam like Lisa Lisa
I'm 5'9" givin' niggas them 6'9" fears
We can battle like them Grind Time kids
How about this, how about I take your wifey on tour with me
And never give her back, same way my nigga Big Sean did
I go hard 'til 2088, my father was crazy like Hailie Jade
StillI I was born a Saint like Baby Ye
I prayed hard and only God I fear
You just plain playin' God, lookin' like James Harden without his beard
These niggas hoes, man it's sickening
They only goals is get some golds and bitches and
Get on the 'Gram wearin' a Roc Nation hat
But anybody who's anybody knows
The closest they ever came to seeing HOV was....
But anybody who's anybody knows
The closest they ever came to seeing HOV was bein' witnesses
So run along with your little microwave hits
All you niggas is my light work like the day shift

Yeah, right now I'm finally respected
Until the day that I'm finally neglected
And I'm fallin', I'm callin' all kinds of pyrotechnical fires in the sky over Heaven
During my final eclectic spiral I die, right on the steps
As if I don't accept it
If it ain't green, I don't see it, I'm color-blind
With my eye on the exit, with my other eye on the double line
On the essence and any other kind of successes of the grind
Dominoes with destiny I'll forever be fuckin' fly
I'm fired with flows, top five and you know
I'm happy at platinum but I was happier
Back when 500 thousand was sold
My proudest accomplishment now
Was when I got quiet to get sober
And silence is gold
I let my whole story fly at no cost to the people
While I'm talkin' to Joe, no Budden
I'm talkin' Joe Walsh from the Eagles
No stuntin', we just wrote somethin'
My demise was s'posed to be weeks ago, keep your smoke comin'
I'm over here with 500 styles like a savant
You wanna see me washed, 500 pounds like I'm Avant
Hair dyed and all fried up like Yung Joc or Jaheim
Only way I'm goin' out is gunshots or sirens
We make paper, you party, we play Vegas
Nothin' but sirens surroundin' me when we play wagers
I'm fuckin' the bitch of my dreams and we they favorite
My BMWi green like DeRay Davis
I be givin' bitches orders like they mothafuckin' grandpa
Trappin' is for rappers, I be grindin' like the dancehall
I don't know astrology, I just know I'm a Cancer male
Eatin' south of France, he who doubts the man can't prevail
Back when Guru used to manifest the rhyme
I was known for nothin' less than just a candidate for crime
In and out of Ibiza, spendin' power, a Visa
Standin' the test of time like the Leaning Tower of Pisa
In my D-zone so the bitches gon' sweat it
Got the same piece of chrome Sweets loaned Bishop on credit
Got the Glock Craig used to help out Smokey and Day-Day with
The 38 Mad Dog used to pop JJ with

Everybody comin' with their hit record, big record
This gon' play in the clubs, radio, chick record
Either that or they come with a diss record
I come from where you don't disrespect none of your successors
I don't fuck hoes that I can't leave in less than six seconds
"Who the best?" is a horrible rhetorical sick question
You guessed it, I'm throwin' bullets at you, but you ain't about to go for long
I'll pull the .44 and let it bang like Post Malone
Might as well get ready for your tomb, you play me
Tell your wife she gon' be solo soon like Swae Lee
Quarter pills, recoupin' the deal worth a quarter mil'
All I'm tryna do is stay Black and get out like Jordan Peele
Everybody do it for the accolades, I'm tired of them
I ain't cared about Grammys since Jay boycotted them
Spent my first advance at Manny's followin' Pharrell and them
Used to ask bitches for ass, now I'm just tellin' them
If I get anymore fly, I'ma need my own space suit
Got these hoes gettin' naked like they high off K2
All I need is five minutes, every style get augmented
Well-endowed, in God's image, never smiled, Kawhi Leonard
These pellets of pedophiles comin' out this arm, bro
They touchy, trust me, Dudley, Arnold
My show start at 12 and it sold out by 11
Rappers blow up, then they debut their whole album on Ellen

Ain't nobody fresher than him, that dealt with more pressure than him
Never dealt with niggas whose image is skinny stretchy denim
Just remember everyone who with me winners
Everyone who with you dinner
Bitches switchin' quick as Bruce and Krissy Jenner
Chrome rims on the whip, just to shine on niggas
Black tires, the lip white, Tyrone Biggums
We givin' out turkeys on Thanksgiving like Nino with us
We even passin' out TVs like Wendy Williams
All I know is that I'm the wild child
Y'all don't want no smoke with these bars
All y'all niggas know is y'all SoundCloud
Let's hypothetically say I'm pissed
I would definitely AR grip, I would definitely spray off quick
Y'all expectin' me to hesitate to shoot this bitch
Then y'all are definitely in the playoffs with JR Smith
I'll definitely put my hand in your pockets but not the way you want
I'll put your whole family in boxes like y'all the Brady Bunch
I go bananas, too miraculous to react to mortal mammals
Cookin' crack in my new velour pajamas
Gettin' back to my roots rap where I store them hammers
Lore the grammar, my IQs my actual quarter-panel
My IP address is my dresser drawer
I ain't stressin' unless it's war, I ain't session, less is more
I bet you you'll die less of my iron's legend for regrettin' gore
Ghost whiter than the driven snow and it's headed north
Lookin' like it's four of the seven dwarfs, flows and metaphors
Bury skulls all over the globe like a Stegosaurus
Why these niggas gettin' their hair dyed and their nails polished?
I'm like Biggie and Pac trapped inside of Big L's body
I don't relate to common folk, they focus on the comments
So I'ma go roll a Testarossa down the coast of Monaco
Lo and behold your honorable, niggas is sheep
Niggas asleep, 'bout as woke as a dinosaur
My connect'll give you a whole kilo of coke
So he can go Geronimo
He should receive a trophy for bein' the Holy
Jesus of flows, he the GOAT
Baaaaaah, that should be my tag
I'm from the streets where the odds are not even
Robbery themin', ball, it's debauchery schemin'
Allah and Jesus, it's hard to believe
I'm a product of Eve in the Garden of Eden
Thinkin' how targeted we've been
Rihanna's stalker, I'm parked in her DMs
Shark in the deep end
Put these paws on you, I'll soften your defense
Hit your pause button, halt your critiquin'
Talk is cheap, the more I hear you talkin', it cheapens
And all I see is prey 'round the streets today
I'm 'bout a freak away from havin' Issa Rae eatin' out Lisa Raye
Any artist out that you see is great
Tell him I said bring his ass, better bring his A
Let his single play
We don't care what you sing
Hit you in your face with the butt of the gun
You leak and give your street credit a few streams
Pop go to weasel nigga fever nigga I'm the illest
You got pop culture fever, nigga
All I know is B.I.G. and Pac quotes
Pop toaster, squeeze the triggers, season tickets
Now I pull the cops over, give them niggas season tickets
Wifey used to shoot me down vicious, now she the missus
She turned me to a family guy quicker than Peter Griffin
I told myself when I was 14 that she the one
Now a nigga prolly got more seeds than Peter Gunz
Now a nigga grow up, my groceries in two-seaters
Used to roll the old-school, four speakers and two tweeters
Ridin' with nothin' but raw, quarter packs in duffles
Ryan writes heaters
Y'all niggas is cut like one of them Get Rich or Die Trying wife beaters
Me, I'm just all shoulder straps and muscle
If you're a hater, let's do it
I'll whip you now then I'll whip on your boy later
Them whippings'll go around like a tornado
I get rid of more yayo
I don't do Rodeo or ayos, I do the Floyd May-o
So many men shoppin' in women's section it ain't no ladies left
You niggas crazy, yes
You playin' crazy like the Chappelle sketch, Wayne Brady ep
I'm what you get when Freeway Rick and Cocaine '80s met
I'm bringin' bars back to the street like Jay and Nas beef
Broadcastin' Ether in HD at godspeed

PRhyme available 3/16
Since '99 I've been dope in this, focusin, unfocusin'
Sure as the sun floats and sure as the sun smokin'
I was the gun totingest, my cuz told me
Don't get demoted, keep it close to your digits
You know you get it, you let yaself get too close to 'em chickens
I said, "I disagree," then I let Superhead lick on me
Strokin' the kitten of Kat Stacks, 'bout to turn around
And write a book about both of them bitches
Next stop, to the top, I done went from A to X,Y
Almost at Z, chillin' at a rest stop
My new bitch, call her my PS3, you?
Your bitch pussy, call it my Xbox
Me, I'm the rhyme ruler, me and Denaun together
Deadly as Nas in his prime, you 'bout deadly as a benign tumor
Since '92, been a highly touted retarded truth
Prolly 'bout to Eli Porter-potty somebody booth
Never sellin my soul, I'm sellin' my skills
I'm on Rap's Radar now, Elliott Wilson
Painter of the underground canvas, even though
I can't freelance no more, the underground's famished
Before I settle for less then average, I'll swallow a watermelon
Follow it with a Double-Down sandwich
I swear that God told me
Slaughterhouse would be the second time around for me
All eyes on me, I know I'm not the greatest, I go hard
Your boombox is now invaded, Bogart, ha!
Look at me today, 8 years ago
I was popular for being hated, Solar!
Nickel Nine's the ruler, God combined with Buddha
Gifted oblongata, prized medulla
Each line's like a computer bomb designed by MacGyver
That only can be detonated by a MacGruber
I'm thinking if I ain't binge-drinkin' then I ain't livin'
Somebody told me I'm prolly dyin', but I ain't listen
By the time it could harm me I'll prolly die by a trigger
So I'm only goin' cold turkey, right after Thanksgivin'
I paint pictures between blank scriptures
Now just how contradictory is it that I pray?
The name's Royce and I be poppin' so much pussy
Dwight Howard look at me sideways
And while the bitches try to grab all on my dick
I can't even get my own nigga to rap on my shit
You form a clique, it should be sacred, I shouldn't say shit
Cause the Truth Hurts, like the bitch that Dre ditched
Nobody loves my niggas like me
Sober or wasted, for you there's no replacement
I swear that God told me
Slaughterhouse would be the second time around for me
All eyes on me!
Dramatic video of a Detroit gas station shooting leads to the arrest of two people, including the woman seen opening fire
Simon Shaykhet is live downtown to...

I'm barbaric to the fuck tards
I don't compare to the subpar
I'm here to see to it the mourning show
It's your funeral for your mom, plus your pa
I'm on the Russ Parr thus far, to us stars
This is just us rock, use a nigga guts for the guitars (put it on)
They getting bodied by an old nigga
Tell them nigga's their baby mamas tryin' to roll with us
I send it back, 'til you mentally raped
Trying to cut carbs, doing the butt to DeBarge
Fly nigga mayday, tryna touch Mars
Tryna get a payday like a nut bar
Tryna get my own island, fuck cars
I'm without a bus card, living in demise
The record label pimpin' him, cause the raps he be givin' 'em
He can actually deliver them and make a
Motherfuckin' ribbon in the sky
I guess I'm just a specimen with the literacy, special ability
I'm characteristically raised, for everything still paid for
Embarrassed niggas like Kimbo with the steel cage flow
No time to take it in, yet, I'm still thankful
I don't discriminate, I take it in pesos
Tryna to close my curtain, I was in Capers
Now I'm insured by the street, now my stint paid for
Stickin with the papers
Sticking to any shit that I say, bro
This is the Vince Staples
I clearly only target the bosses
Whenever we arrive at your office
I definitely body your authors
I'm Martin Shkreli, everybody audit the auction
About it and cautious, a product of losses
Living modest, dealing with problems
That the cars in his closet is costing
Niggas hearts turn into jelly the second that they have to part with their celly
Live life behind real bars
They don't know what it feels like to have a real fight
At night in the dark with your celly
Never take advice from the jealous
Watch your man, even if you got to watch him take an L'ie
You still gotta stand by him like you Omelly
The white girl got you bugging out like Liza Minnelli
My car's on fire, the tires Pirelli
I'm Martin and Eddie
Searching for Taral Hicks
Not to give her a baby, but to put a life in her belly
I'm barbaric with the nine and all
Am I in everybody's top 5? Not at all
You could find a nigga name in the ladies room
On a lot of walls, topic of vagina monologues
I write a lot of bars, that's why I'm poppin' like an adderall
I'm duplicated, more than Audemars
If you could take the beef home with you
You could make a goat out of ours
If you can take the bars and the rhymes home you can make a soap out of ours
These are breaks you had to be casted
Fatality to flattery flaccid
You bleed blood, I leak battery acid
There's no wrath that you can accurately battle me after
I'm that great
After Adam and Eve ate the apple
I evaporated, came back a cadaver
You can't assassinate me
Name: abracadabra
Guns is named Latimer
Got the little kids doing dirty things in the hood for me
I ain't talking about the same as the Vatican
If it ain't immaculate it ain't adequate
I heard your dog switching genders, ain't that a bitch
Banana clip on an automatic, take that and split
This that lyrical, acrobatic, straight savage shit

Straight savage
Straight savage
Ant Man what's up
Let's go get these niggas

The whole hip hop game need a rap lift
Surgery to the trolls and the catfish
Say my name five times, I'm showing up to your home
To your computer room and your blow up little mattress
In the big black whip
Let your bitch lick my dick sack five times and take her to Saks Fifth
Everything I say is like an 8th in a transit
And just waiting to wrap you in plastic for a rapper to come and take it and spastically pass away
She fucking with you
She definitely could fake an orgasm
She fucking with me
She definitely could take a giraffe dick
And I'm just hustling like I'm at a cabaret
Straight savage
Anywhere I'm goin' land is the exit
If it ain't lavish
I'm my own man like Stedman
I took my life into my own hands same way I take matters
Listening to Coltrane on average
With a no name bad bitch
Took her to my home, laid it down on the table
In powder same way cocaine gathers
Oops, I mean pounded her
You can either get down with us
Or let the ground come up and get you like Hank Gathers
Niggas think they've seen the things that I've seen
Just cause we on Instagram in the same glasses
Just cause we in the YSL same jacket
Doesn't mean that we're cut from the same fabric
What the fuck, is you high as hell?
You know nothing about the iron in the tire well
All you know about is the obvious shit
Like Kanye riffing or what? He'll probably yell
And I bet you probably one of the old creeps helping Kylie Jenner little body sell
Mermaids, water, good diver skills
Sandwiches in the Desert with a side of mayo
Transcriptions in the present got a lot of mail
Still getting money off the books like Galileo
I'm in the Panamera listening to Pantera
The bitch with me, sipping on caberna and >???<
I keep a narcotic in the car by the teaspoon
I give her a G-Unit, I hear she a fan of Yayo
I got to roll with a gat in the back
I get pulled over and they ask who I am
Oh, because the accent is black?
I tell them I'mma poet cause it's a dead giveaway
That I'm much more than just a Cat in the Hat
I be laughing at your guys while laughing at you
If you ask who I am nigga, I'm laughing at that
I'm a bullseye for time to laugh and attack
Kiss my ass and after that I put your ass in the crack
Speaking of crack rock, my pocket line with that
You could step on my pocket and break your momma back
Every weapon of pound I got is Floyd Mayweather
Doing a movie definitely ready to counter act
Got your bitch jumping 'round on the boat
Looking like when flounder flap
And it ain't because she found a map
We savages
If your bitch with us and you call her and she tell you that she tied up
She might be literally bound and gagged
I'm sick, I'm sick and permanent
Like the doctor opened me up and found a mask
Close me up, left inside of me an ounce of hash
I exercise for dumbbells hanging onto the gun rail
While I'm pressing up piles of cash
(A synth pad with heavy effects is heard, then a muffled drum beat that sounds like a live drummer begins.  The noise and shouts of a military group are heard as they engage in what sounds like an offensive attack.)

I said America the beautiful
Land of free, home of brave
Everyone is born and raised to think like a dead man
When you alive you the lowest on the totem pole
And soon as you die then here goes this
Oh, now he heroic
Oh, now he the coldest
Oh, now it's "he had that talent and I didn't know it"
Man listen, being humble ain't gon' get you out your grave
You should treat your life the same way you thinking like and go and whip it like a slave

What the fuck is arrogant?
That's the shit they injecting into us Americans
How 'bout I think I was put here to push European whips
And so what if you don't like it, I thought you'd be inspired
By the way I whip it, way I whip it
Way I whip it, way I whip it
I whip it
Right past the pretenders, the men with no passion
Who think it's possible to be past your potential like life has just ended
The spirit broken and so the wife and kids are born into only knowing the White Castle menu
While the richest born into white castles
Attending Bar Mitzvahs, the future of us niggas is in syringes
We meant for the NFL, injure the NBA
Anyway, I take popping shots at niggas over receiving posthumous props from niggas any day
Maybe y'all just scared, lost in everybody saying not to floss so you go watch the Walking Dead
Yeah you in the

America the beautiful
Land of free, home of brave
Everyone is born and raised to think like a dead man
When you alive you the lowest on the totem pole
And soon as you die then here goes this
Oh, now he heroic
Oh, now he the coldest
Oh, now it's "he had that talent and I didn't know it"
Man listen, being humble ain't gon' get you out your grave
You should treat your life the same way you thinking like and go and whip it like a slave

What the fuck does humble mean?
Call me good at something I'll say I'm good at a bunch of things
I feel my whole life my fire should be lit
I feel my wife's pussy wet each time she sees my dick she get excited by the way I whip it, way I whip it, way I whip it
She likes the way I whip it
I whip it
Man look here, I've been anti-corporate since daddy told me
That they force me here against my will
Without no horses or some land
Of course they saying I'm supposed to just forget they throw the scrap at those that can distract with those endorsements
Closing doors and all of those who buy the clothes and shoes
And booze and albums
Hope you not expecting treatment by the book
From he who wants you to forget that you was brought over here by the boat
I don't know why niggas say they money funny when it's low
Cause when you broke it's not a joke
Talk that we can't take shit with us when we die shit
You don't leave behind shit cause you died without shit
In

America the beautiful
Land of free, home of brave
Everyone is born and raised to think like a dead man
When you alive you the lowest on the totem pole
And soon as you die then here goes this
Oh, now he heroic
Oh, now he the coldest
Oh, now it's "he had that talent and I didn't know it"
Man listen, being humble ain't gon' get you out your grave
You should treat your life the same way you thinking like and go and whip it like a slave

If he's hot, expose him, then
Roll on him, we can't roll on him
Roll on his closest kin
That kind of behavior, I call that "Niggerdom, Niggerdom"
Mentally enslave them, taze them, then they go crazy
Uh, here they come
Everybody think a revolution coming
Wanna be involved in the riot
Everybody arguing out here, this how I feel:
"What in the Jiminy cracker corner fuck are we bickering for?"
This shit here is bigger than war
They sticking and sicken the shit in the food that the nigga consume so it's hidden in stores
Some shit that can kill your fertility, damage your thinking
Limit your abilities, think about that now
The fact that y'all living is crazy cause alcoholism got black people tapping out quicker than Savion Glover
And we ain't no Avión lovers
We dying each time that the Hennessy pours
Our plugs are the mothers on the other side of our umbilical cords
Can I talk my shit? Y'all niggas confidence dropping
Y'all letting people control y'all flow who don't know how y'all clocks tick
I'm disgusted
Find the money if the money don't fit
Do like me on this and find a different pocket
Only in America

Oh damn, I guess you is kinda talented
Make sure you don't forget where you came from, boy
Always stay humble
Now why don't you do that thing again with your tongue
You know that one thing when you go and whip it...
(*Whip cracking sound*)
I'll be shutting niggas up when I talk
But nothing's ever gonna get done to me
Y'all ain't gon do nothing at all
I'm gon be talking shit forever man, ever man
Shut the fuck up when I talk
Nothing's ever gonna get done to me
Y'all ain't gon do nothing at all
I talk about your ass forever man, ever man

Last name Voorhees, first name Jason
Like a loaded pistol, boy, I ain't nothing to play with
You don't want no problems, that drama be too horrendous
Fuck you and your feelings, your Momma the who offended
Pimping ain't easy, but bitch I'm in the building
I'm the smack man, I got a backhand like Serena Williams
He hungry like them Africans on the TV asking feed the children
Even though he be eating like he Sicilian
I sweat brilliance, I shit genius
You on fire till I come by you and extinguish
I'm distinguised, I'm bout to quit writing
You bout to grow a set of hooters while a nigga just winging
My dick swinging, it's slapping my leg so much the shit's stinging
You heard who better than me, bitch bring em, uh!
He stepped up like Rocky, he'll probably be finished
He'll go from looking like he Balboa to Rocky Dennis
You thought you was winning til every tooth in your mouth is in
A pouch in your pocket, the next time you talk to your dentist
These lame niggas say they bodies is endless
Get in my lane, they license to kill is probably suspended
I'm fly, feeling like I got wings and I'm in the air
I miss my flight, tell the pilot I said "I'll meet you there"
Cause he too rare, there should be a sign on every vocal booth
That says, "If Nickel-9 cues to do your beat, beware"

Last name, Pay Me, first name, Fuck You
You collect and call me by my alias, it's What Loot
Find me with your bitch my dick out, with a mouth on it
Take her round the corner a couple times, put some miles on it
Take her round monsters, OGs that used to be slaves
For Reagan helping to fund the Iran contra
Poster boy for gun rap, I got all kind of rhymes
Done about my guns cousin cause I got, tons of em
I ain't no, industry nigga, I don't do no events
I got some red carpets that's under my shoes in the Benz
He so street, when he do it, the sewer's his twin
He spit that shit, he should spit it into a depend
When it come to rhyming, I'm a Ducati, your dude is a Schwinn
I don't do parties and you, you just do men
My crew just too sick, your crew got pooper scoop dicks
My crew just drink and do chicks, nigga, y'all ain't gon' do shit
Slaughterhouse dynamic is Ortiz too mature for beef
Joey kill you with his words, me, I do it forcefully
Crooked is the smart one, but don't you get it twisted
That nigga there he will kill ya, I been to see how he living
When I brain storm actual rain comes
I am one with the streets, I Sam Cookes the beat until change come
My brain got different compartments, one it holds the psychosis, One it holds the explosives, one just got a note in it
That says on it, "Homie knows that he dope
He stay on his toes, he ferocious"
It's hopeless to focus on me with negative energy
You'll only lose your focus, I am not the best
I am death, now let God and Satan iron out the rest

Ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha
That's the victory laugh
Ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha ha
And since I can't do another nigga beat
Without y'all try thinking I'm dissing him
Shout out my nigga Drake
Now get the fuck out my face fore I fuck you up

July 5, 1977
Detroit, Michigan
Porter, you a real nigga, man

It all started with a Starter coat
The starter pistol got us out the momma jokes
The house party finally started, now it's time to go
Get some pussy sponsored by the barber and a bar of soap
I'm stealing cars, it wasn't logical
But on the bright side, they taught us how to drive 'em doe
We used to tilt them bitches with screw drivers
So I'm kinda used to being at the bottom of your columns, ho
But the Billboard list was kinda comical
How the fuck was it designed and chronicled
I can see it now for sho'
Bunch of blasés from a buncha artists with a timeless flow
Gettin' trampled over on a 20 year old blogger flow
If 'Pac ain't on your list then you ain't fuckin' logical
I'm talkin' up the shit, not no fuckin' 5 or 4
What you gon' tell me when I tell you 'Pac introduced me to the fuckin' UNLV Starter coat
It all started with a Starter coat
Wonderin' why Brenda threw that baby in the garbage fo'
On my way to cop my navy blue Starter coat
It all started with a Starter coat
The starter pistol kept niggas out here from startin' smoke
Without it I'd be dead or be an artichoke
The 9 iron armor in the heart of gold (it's that fo')
Nobody witchu nigga that's the Art of War (let's go to war)
But do not forget you fuckin' start it doe (that's my mama)
(Woah, what kinda coat is that?) Starter coat

I grew up with three brothers
As soon as I was born my lungs collapsed
And I had to be hooked up to a ventilator

Now a nigga shining doe
Growing up I gave a lotta niggas shiners doe
I gave a lot of people my respect
Daddy taught me that one growing up
He threw me through a shower door
I used to wonder why my uncle looking startled fo'
Crawlin' around all on the ground like his heart is broke
I found out he got a crack problem and he thought he dropped a couple particles
Well I'm a fucking alcoholic so
Who am I to judge, I'm just honorable
I be temporarily in love when I'm inside a ho
I'm a pure artist I don't need to see the charts to know the art is under our control
Highs, lows, problems, pain, drama that's what's optimal
I guess I'm just the best at thanking God and feeling awesome doe
Cause I survived the era of the Starter coat
It all started with the Starter coat
I lost my virginity aboard the fucking Boblo boat
I ain't graduate on time
I ain't go to college so
A couple friends of mine did
Other friends of mine dead
I'm fuckin reminded
Just because I made the most money
That don't mean I went the farthest doe
I hope my college friends reminded
You got degrees that don't mean you the smartest doe
Mo' money, mo' problems
I lost plenty mo' marbles on my marble floor
Then I left in my Starter coat
What they taught us that was all a joke
You may not got a lotta dollars at least you got a post
I'm arguing with Satan screaming "I don't barter souls!"
Please don't take my memories of me and my Starter coat

What kind of coat is that? Starter coat
What kind of coat is that? Starter coat
What kind of coat is that? Starter coat
What kind of coat is that? Starter coat

"Now we see the direct and indirect effects. We see the rise in murder, in abuse, in battles, teen prostitution, and teen suicide. We hear the wailing mothers, the grieving sisters, the tormented brothers and fathers, and children planning their own funeral with pink dresses and pink caskets."
"If the filth that is portrayed in these gangsta rap videos and art is not obscene then I submit that nothing is obscene."

We started off as targets
We had the Congress mad at the whole genre
Tryna get rid of us
Now it's like we not even trying to be good
It's like we just sitting ducks in the eyes of evil
I open windows with hopes that the wind blows you ten mo' blessings
Set my Timbo's next to my dresser with the  Nintendo, and yes
The extendo's on the AK 47 and it's wrapped in the dresses of En-Vogue
It's time, it's time to move something
I guess we missed our window to try to prove something
Spot a whack producer from across the room
Walk up to him, smack his hookah across the moon
Break a platinum plaque over a rapper back
Go and toss that bitch into a dark lagoon
Go into the heart of the art form with a harpoon
They ain't skilled enough to stand the field with us
You gon' have to retire me
It's only like four or five of you rappers who can actually inspire me
I be out here telling the truth
I should sign my autograph with a polygraph
I move in silence tryna get to you 'fore you could brace yourself
Cause I'm tryna put yo' ass in a body cast
Y'all niggas lollygag, not me
This evening I'm with the biggest spenders having the most prestigious dinner
You eating Church's Chicken with suspicious fictitious sinners
I'm a living legend, you a fidget spinner
I'm getting cheddar, they tryna catch up to my past M's
And I'm getting better quicker, tryna catch up and pass Em'
I be blacking out, you could ask them
Everything I spit be sick, gag phlegm
Everything I wear be tailor-made to fit, Giraffe trim
Huh, it seem like everybody out here right now wanna be 'Pac
While I'm zoning, stirring the pot
I'm 'bout to go so motherfucking Lamont Coleman
This 'bout to be disturbing to watch
While I'm out here swerving the drop
Your favorite rapper 'bout to get cleaned up, served in a box
Like laundry detergent, pushing 'round these birds with a mop
Tryna stay in a genius, creative state of mind
Tryna stay sharper than straight sharks in a 'gator pond
Grate her down, all for the greater good and the greater grind
While they denying now, all these heathens be crying 'bout
Taking care of two, three dudes but these people be lying
We keeping it G, we keeping the iron out
They feed negativity, we eating vagina while
Keeping it Zion, we turning the streets of Detroit to a D zoo
Eating while we feed people to lions
The dude that I brought with me psycho and schizo
He think that he Luke, he like to lift you and make you skywalk
You don't wanna play with none of his make-believe truth
They'll make the iron speak too
He'll do the R2D2 to your heart
Until it's parts of a easel
Threw a piece of your heart in a jar for the people
To dissect at Juilliard
I'm the best at who we are, that's fucking food for thought
Nobody else been thinking like me thus far though
Subpar cerebrals

"For 400 years, profit came before principle."
"We marched for our rights to Selma, I was there with Dr. King."
"—music that glorifies and promotes violence with guns, knives, or drugs—"
"—and that includes all this gangsta rap—"
"—that's it—"
"—we march again and we're gonna keep on marching and demonstrating till it..."

I make your mouthpiece obese like Della Reese
While I'm flipping pies like Patti LaBelle, Sara Lee
Eating all the bark with Gargamel off of the cherry tree
King of the dark art, all is pale compared to me
Let the hail from the evil word flip hath fury
While hip-hop stay colorful fruity like RiFF RaFF jewelry
I enter into a different intuitiveness on instruments
I just whiplash new beats
You just the next wave to catch a crazy catchphrase
I'm just a neck brace to the next crazy contestant who should step to me, neck pain
Tell paparazzi I'm charging sales tax to media
In order to picture these digits, press will have to capture Loch Ness
On the back of a hellcat or capture a meteor
Me, I left from the frying pan like the Devil's last ingredient
While Jesus wept I made boss music flunkies relate to
Better each time I came through like I held back the previous
Look, I'm the real thing
These niggas just here to provide dangerous detail
If any of y'all MCM's is any flyer than me there
These niggas listen to sign language, probably speak braille
Me, I'm just about to stick my dick in the dirt
Either that or a model, these Ether raps are the Bible
I'm gon' relapse for a bottle or be in the absence of Godot
Relax for a throttle
One of the last living rap forefathers who wouldn't ask for a dollar
My style lethal ferocious
Streaming out your club when your single drop
Like a single drop of blood off the beak of a vulture
Uh, I broke my key off in the car door
Just as I was on my way to score a quarter key off Artmore
I'm an angel at squalor
My threshold for pain goes farther than a marine who's been ordered to war
So at 3:45, which, by the way, is a quarter a to four
Somebody ask me for change for a dollar
While I spray your ass with four different fours
More layers than 44 sorting couture
Vocabulary lords sicker than Herbie's recording thesaurus
The Virgin Mary took a morning-after pill the morning before fornicating the Lord
They gave birth to me 44 days later drinking a 40 at the coroner's door
Therefore, this is more than just my dormitory
This is the safe place I come to look Benjamin in the face
So when you gon' end up getting ate like four and four
Icicles is made of blood-boiling water alluring gore
I'm here to combine all three Bar Exams for a fourth
While I shoot the shit as deep as foul goes though, so it's four to four
While driving a Ford wondering why guys look at me foreign for

"—we're beaten with billy clubs and we're bitten with dogs unleashed by Bull Carters. We will not tolerate injustice and insults from our worst enemies then, and we sure ain't gonna accept insults from our youth..."
Rock City

Disrespect and get a new smile under your neck
A city full of thug-ass niggas, and punk-rockers
A lot of niggas act like Pac, so cops watch 'em
Them shot blocks up in the black or the light Timbs
White boys look, act, and rap like Slim (hi)
Fight Music, knife users never respect it
Guns talk, high schools with metal detectors
A city full of Tommy Hearns thumpers
Grant Hill hoopers, Barry Sanders runners, stunners
Chaldeans with weed-connects like whoa

Fuck
Let's get it started like transmission and alternators
Got the keys in the cage ready for who you call the greatest
Takin' 'em down from the biggest bitches to smallest haters
I'm 'bout to serve these niggas, call 'em waiters
Got my mind right, money right, ready for war
And I got the C4, under my competitor's car
These niggas runnin' 'round talkin' 'bout they better than moi
When I'm done all that's gon' be left bitch is ya head and ya bra
Bitch I'm the head of the pack, and I'm ahead of the game
And I put yo' head on a platter you put some shit on my name
Bitch I'm the shit, see the stains that I done left on the track?
And I ain't sayin' no names but I left the best on they back
And they ain't sayin' no names so I gotta say it myself
I'm finger fuckin' this game so you gotta play with yourself
Don't pull a K off the shelf, or pull a strap out the stash
I ain't gotta draw the pistol, I'll be clap at yo' ass
I just let the hands of God toe-tap on you fast
Leave you mashed like potatoes on the top of the grass
Call the coppers to catch me and they'll just tell you to drop it
I'll find you sooner or later and they can't do shit to stop it
Got that thang and I'mma pop it like a bubble on the double
I am trouble in the flesh, you can't see me with the Hubble
We ain't wishin' these niggas good luck, go get a clover
This Bun B, it's "B.E. 3," this shit is over

SLAUGHTERHOUUUUUSE! (Whoo, Kiiiiiiiid!)

Look at ya man look back at me, yeah I know, sickenin' huh?
If you got a Porsche with only two doors, need to upgrade cause you missin' some
We just got two different bills, different styles, different sums
Started as a drive-by, ended as a hit-and-run
Stop me in the streets, let it be properly when you greet
Fuck lookin' for me, I'm on your property if it's beef
Not for robbery of ya piece, it's lobotomy with my peeps
That comraderie is usually sodomy for the beat
'Less my critics put a lens on them, so I could look through it
Shut the fuck up, probably mean that you too shook to do it
We'd see two pennies to your name, yet you so saucy
When I fix this game you can Thank Me Later for it, no Aubrey
Switch my demeanor up I'm, off my 380 shit
My, future's bright, stars is by my head, Baby shit
Make me sick, what you eat don't make me shit
Found out the reason they hate me is my God-like presence, must be atheist
While all of the frauds in rap is talkin' swag put a fork in that
Slaughter's back, listen nigga I got houses all across the map
Even got a Boston pad, got this bitch from Boston bad
Well put her in a wrestlin' move, but I heard she got that Boston Crab
Batteries in your back, go by what he say
Just need you to know that it's no lee-way, and the tables are turned, go DJ
So you know what that blindfold's for
That bloodshed's a secret, let's keep it behind closed doors

Who you said was dope again?
Ay, it ain't nobody fuckin' with us, nobody fuckin' with us
Who you said was hot again?
Ay ay, it ain't nobody fuckin with us, nobody fuckin' with us
Who you say could spit again?
Ay, it ain't nobody fuckin' with us, nobody fuckin' with us
Who you say was dope again?
Ay ay, it ain't nobody fuckin' with us, nobody fuckin' with us

I'm the present and the future
Like Christmas in 2012 I'm the present in the future, an executive producer
You will never get to choose ya destiny cause you a pessimistic loser
Mess with me and I'll definitely shoot ya
I'mma do's ya like I'm reppin the Yakuza
Die hard like I'm sexing with Medusa, do something nigga
Born thuggin', I don't fuck with the cops
Nuts hang down my pant leg, balls tucked in my socks
I ain't gotta act tough to get a couple of props
Little nigga raised hisself, I don't know what's up with my pops
Do I think I'm the dopest in America? I do
Make you switch your whole style like you're datin' Erykah Badu
Pair of Ferragamo shoes, I will stomp you
I'm fucked up, like the relationship between Farrakhan and Jews
I'm spankin' this instrumental, like a wrinkly old bitch
I'm whippin' the kick and snare, make 'em pick they own switch
I'm smarter than computers that know how to fix they own glitch
I'll leave you face down, like chicks who lick they own tits
And from this day forward, Crooked is aging backwards
Gettin' younger and fresher, puttin' bums under some pressure
Yes sir! Watch the next Slaughterhouse album
Every line is white powder, I ain't talkin' 'bout talcum
I am tighter than "The Biggest Losers" cruisin' in a Smart car
Distinguished alkie, the flask on the armoire
I'm from the home of the most popular bomb weed
Most proper, hoes rock with my partners who top seed
Po' vodka, we gon' bottle pop in the calm breeze
No copper can stop a COB star - I'm a giant
Dumpin' my cigar ashes out on top of the palm trees
Chrome chopper, if I squeeze you drop on the concrete
You wanna' talk about the paper? Oh let's do it
Batter pocket syndrome, the money we gon' abuse it
Still gettin' out-of-town paper so don't confuse it
Tell the hip-hop cops nah, it's only music
And haters steady eavesdroppin' on "The Bar Exam"
Probably in your trunk now dependin' on what car I ram


Flow tight I should probably ghostwrite for your idol
My pen game is God-like, I could write for the Bible
I'm so good, that after I rock it tonight
I'mma go Sexual Chocolate a drop the mic
Don't even attempt to stop me, mention me, top me
My pencil is nice, should only mentally be dropping the dice
I'm a speech beast, you best to not approach me
Matter a fact I think I second that emotion like a re-tweet
My stock goin' up like a Lamborghini door
I feel like Chuck Woolery in the damn Bellini store
You playing yourself you remind me of the lotto'
You was good and then you turned hood, you remind me of Moscato
I don't aim, I'm like Dick Cheney
The 4 spray and light your head up like Lo Pan when he gets angry
This ain't Simon Says, bitch, this what Ryan says
I hit the track and it's a wrap like Aunt Jemima head
I'm beyond out of my mind, if you can imagine
Usin' Magic's johnson without a condom, I'm bonkers
Yeah, got the streets goin' "dude is tremendous"
If I come for your blood I ain't gonna be usin' syringes
I am raw, there is a difference between I and y'all
You opposed, you throwin' fire balls at an iron wall
The sound of Alan Grunblatt signin' his name on the dotted line
On that paper is your favorite rapper signin' off
Baby! Baby!
Damn, slow down a little bit
I just wanna get to know you baby
You know what I'm saying?
I don't wanna bite you, it's all chicken except for the bone
Shit, I'm just
Hey, I'm getting a little money out here
I just wanna spread the wealth
You know what I'm saying?
I got, I got money, I got credit cards, I got PayPal cards
What ever you want to do, we could do EBT
You need groceries?
Shit baby, what you looking at?
What the fuck you see over there?
A Unicorn?

Niggas sweat bitches
While bitches sweat the chill nigga in the sweats
If you don't get no respect
It really don't matter, you could be Louis Vuitton'd up
You might as well have on Von Dutch and Tommy Hilfiger with a debt
I don't do dirt, I don't call scenes
I send niggas through to leave a mess

I'm a real nigga in the flesh
I will find a bitch in distress
I will make her feel so alive
Then beat her with the dick to death
Real nigga in the flesh
If shit ain't right between us
We will leave a nigga left
Real nigga in the flesh

I despise rapping niggas
Y'all niggas fly private, I come sky jack you niggas
You disrespect me, I'll get on board with three Ks out
And go to your PJ's pilot
Tell him I need those jet's keys like I'm DJ Khaled
Seems like every artist out there snorting coke and smoking base
I just opened up the briefcase and dumped out the contents
To close up an open case
If my soul shall rise then I'ma lift the hood up like Tray Martin
I'm a clapper, they targets
They trappers, I'm a convict slash escape artist

Real nigga in the flesh
Finding bitches in distress
Make 'em feel so alive
Then beat 'em with the dick to death, yes
Real nigga in the flesh
If shit ain't right between us
We will leave a nigga left
Real nigga in the flesh

I'm p-o-p, you d-u-d
You bark up this tree, I'll make you turn over three new leafs
You live right by the code or get left like three two three
I'm A Tribe Called Quest, I'm the new G
Out here going dumber than Tweedledee
All these youngins wanna redo me, like these movies
'Cause I'm so Pablo Escobar-esque
Elephant in the room, never out my element
Oh, always on my P's and Q's like RSTUV, ah!
Never tell your intel to a gent who's intelligent
'Cause he'll tell a friend who then shall attempt
To turn bullets into shells and spin, and turn humans into skeletons, grrah

I'm a real nigga in the flesh
Finding bitches in distress
Make 'em feel so alive
Then beat 'em with the dick to death, yes
Real nigga in the flesh
If shit ain't right between us
We will leave a nigga left
Real nigga in the flesh, yes

I'm breaking now 'cause I'm dating goddesses
The haters tried but couldn't feed me salt
'Cause I seasoned all them, now I'm raking dollars in
Say goodbye, I'm finna take you outta here
You can't deny it, I'm the H in igher
Here the four door Porsche or whatever vehicle
A nigga like Lincoln couldn't survive without made it out and over four scores and seven years ago
I know time flies by, yours tick-tick-tick
Mines went-went-went-went like eleven layers ago
My flow so heaven sent
When I go to heaven, I'ma go "Heaven here you go"
I'ma go tell God, "I know I promised that I'd never steal your flow," I lied
Ain't nothing like side pussy on my dick
Word to the motherfucking DJ Quik
Bunch of girls wanna have a bunch of relations
Even when a nigga wanna be they friend
I learned that faithful women need they men
They don't really wanna leave they men
They just don't wanna get a phone call
From another chick saying where he done been
If your bitch 'bout to leave better ask yourself questions
Like "fight for her? Why?"
You better step up and fight for her like you're fighting for Hawaii
Or you motherfucking B.J Penn
I'm a real nigga in the flesh
My wife almost left me but she ain't do it
I don't like the way "ex-wife" sound, that don't got a ring to it
I guess I'm not typical which is cool
I guess I'm not hip as you which is cool
I guess I'm not into the shit you're into which is cool
Nigga you's a bitch and your bitch a dude which is cool

I look around and all I see is fools
Some of y'all got street cred, some of y'all got pre-approved
Some of y'all got red carpet rolled out for y'all quick as you
Drop, went right from a Honda to a box 62
They dance and they ballin' and they zonin' like they Victor Cruz
Labels only care about hits and views which is cool
Not only am I the alchemist, I'm the evidence
The wicked witch is cool, the cause of her demise
Reminds me of this jet I'm in, a flyin' residence
If you don't write your own rhymes get offended this is to you and you
Listen fool no more bars for you
You can't raise the bar, you ain't in the buildin'
Matter of fact you can't even lift a stool, fool
That liquor disappear from my system like skippin' school
Me and these niggas live by the same don'ts but different do's
To get they name out they willin' to get the lube
That Balmain fit me like my religion true
Call my assistant tell him I'm slippin', I'm spittin' jewels
Somebody come out and get them like them Memphis dudes
We independent, while y'all flash bitches
We in the trenches, ball sack lickin' addiction, y'all need interventions
The gas pedal mashin' the carpet in them SL Benzes
The dash retarded like the special olympics
The needle leanin' past the finish line like Lance Armstrong
I'm exotic smellin' like your baby momma vagina, bonfire island
A Creed Avensis
I'm not a killer I'm just stricken with a sickness called homicidalitis
Flat screens surround me and my dubs seat up in my whip
So she can read her twitter mentions in three dimensions
It's no such thing as flossin' if you ain't never seen the dentist
But some of y'all need to take them gold slugs out of your face
Load 'em in the pistol and shoot 'em the fuck into outer space
Maybe I ain't rich as you which is cool
Maybe I ain't weird as you which is cool
Maybe it ain't a style to be lyrical


I don't give a motherfuck, I just get your mother touched
I pick my own date, pay my way, call that double dutch
I grip the ass, I dump the tip, call that shit the double clutch
Wax on, wax off, clean that ugly stubble up
Bonsai, truth is gonna un-lie at sunrise
Your makeup's running, Uber's gonna catch you when it comes by
You boys are entertainment, I understand you like the bitch
But you are pretty famous, sweater like the one Cosby
Wore at his arraignment, uh, I stay patient
Pray gracious, made milli's, while billi' racin'
Now they wanna trade places, as my ceiling raises
My prime lays dormant, they computerized, not I
See, I'm straight torrent, I clock in, write it with my pen, out my acorn
And then I clock out, and leave a black cloud on all eight corners
Started with us to hear the pop loud - Robin Harris' House Party
I bet y'all acquit it, like a child killing cop trial
All you see on the ground is an empty rock vials
Like Tommy Lee and Pam Anderson, I'm  in the Trump Tower
With this here piece manners here, Magnum condom fit, like Juelz Santana
Bandana gear, I used to need antifreeze
She about to need antifrizz, antifrizz
I'm Pac and I'm Nas when I famed danced to anti big
I'm not a star, ho, I'm on Uranus on a pantie binge
Far as are as y'all aside, from flaming all of y'all
I feel like I fathered all of your bars, like I came up in your granny's crib
The most interesting man, on the god damn planet
Beef is having a nigga's bitch, fix me some god damn salmon
Beef is trying a nigga's clothes on, when he ain't home
Beef is your wife, when kids at school, texting me "They're gone"
I just took a dip in your swimming pool, which is cool
I think, you need to find some more comfortable slipper shoes, which is cool
Trust the fucking shooter

Long live all the goons who get half just to find their ass
Line your fast, you could never minute past rapidly
Long nose, think sneeze at you
You know a nigga sinus bad
Ten nine, you never mind to rag
I sit and wonder how much mind you had
Long flight, had the time to lag
I came from cross the road, to cross the globe
To off the load, to get all kinds of bags

A women's loyalty is tested
When her man has nothing
A man's loyalty is tested
When that man has everything
The definition of a legend
Is a man who starts with nothing
And leaves the game with everything

Legendary
That shit there gon' make you legendary
This shit here gon' make me legendary
Make me legendary
This shit here gon' make me legendary

Pardon, nigga, I'm the hardest nigga out
The farthest nigga out the party nigga, I'm the artist
I put all these niggas in the garbage
All these niggas in the toilet
While I sit in orbit, I'm not getting better
I'm just getting started, started I'm just getting
I just flipped it like I do all my competition
Let me slow this shit down
I just need me a bad one
Come over here and wear my flag hon'
I give y'all the bottom line, I don't do a lot of talkin'
Cause a lot of talkin' take up a lot of time
And I don't got a lot of time
Since a kid sittin' in the wicker chair
With the sweater with the collar out of mine
I swore a lot and swear to promise to cut the line
Swear not to get out of line
I can't have 'Pac in my closet, I don't got time to idolize
I just cop it and toss it
I don't got time to itemize, my flight is high
Probably the only thing around me tonight that's high
Besides my I-D-E-O-logy
Pockets chubby, I should say tubby
Cause I'm ballin' like Dr. J
Wonderin', "How could they sub me?"
I certainly got comrades like Conrad Murray
Who operate ugly from around the way
I'm lookin' around at these pretty girls, and this what I got to say

Ain't no better feeling
Than turning down you a bad one
That's that shit gon' make you legendary
That's that shit gon' make you legendary
It ain't no better feeling
Than turning down you a bad bitch
That right there gon' make you legendary
That right there gon' make you legendary

That's that shit gon' make you legendary
That's that shit gon' make you legendary
I ain't tryna fuck every bitch that's tryna fuck me
That shit right there just ain't necessary
All I'm tryna be is legendary
That right there won't make you legendary
I remember I was just a pimp
Save all that extra shit
You bitches' neck'll twist quick as The Exorcist
Just tryna catch a glimpse, bitch I look excellent
Soon as I exit, I peel out advantage
She try to look hard cause her ride lookin' small
We will suit up and boot up and get out like Mexicans
All you niggas do is party all the time
Party all the time, party, party, party
Once you my target, I'll stop you while you're startin'
Started, why you stoppin'? My niggas clock around the party
Around the clock, wearing choppers 'round the .40
And rocket launcher down the block
Mwah! And they ain't got no lawyers
That gon make 'em fuckin' legendary
That's gon make you fucking legendary
Beautiful women asking "When we gon' get together?"
I told all 'em bitches "Nevuary"
Now all them baddest bitches know to never come to me with nonsense
Cause they know that I will fuck 'em once
Like a record company then drop 'em
Hold up, that's that shit gon make you legendary
That shit gon make me so, so, so legendary
'Specially if she acting suspect
And the pussy just end up being so, so
I'm just a superhuman being with the quickest slow flow
Got the underground wire, like the tires low pro
Got the eye of the tiger inside of the mind of a, old soul, yo

It ain't no better feeling
Than turning down you a bad one
That right there gon make you legendary
That right there gon make you legendary
It ain't no better feeling
Than turning down you a bad bitch
That's that shit gon make you legendary
That's that shit gon make you legendary

That's that shit gon make you legendary
That's that shit gon make you legendary
You get more for your money when you fuck with Mr. Porter

Hello
Hey Lincoln
Hey Porsche what's up
Hey baby what's up
Nah nothing much, what's up with you?
Nah nothing, got this broke ass nigga outside
Oh y'all about to go out? Hang?
I ain't going out for long
Probably cause he don't be blowing no good
Naw baby he ain't like you, he don't be blowing no good
Haha well shit I got hotpockets in the oven, what you need?
I wanna see you later
Well my son do got a basketball game later on, but that lil nigga ain't even starting so
You so crazy
Yeah I'm...I can save that gas, I'll be through there

I been waiting in this bitch driveway for an hour my nigga, hell no
There's only one way I can fix this problem my nigga, that's sell dope
I ain't come in this bitch to politic or rub elbows
Even my own bitch know I'm mentally unavailable, I'm busy, I sell dope
I'm focused, I'm focused, I'm focused on three things
That's go and buy three chains, that's fuck your bitch at my earliest convenience and sell dope
When I'm with her she creeping on you, when I hit it I hit it with my phone on speaker phone
While she's moaning I'm still tryna, tryna sell dope
My teacher asked me what I wanna do when I grow up, I told her "Bitch, sell dope"
She told me go to the principal's office, I went to go sell dope
I don't care about y'all, what y'all wear, where y'all been
All I know is I'm fresh as fuck from head to toe
If you don't like it you can get the fuck out my car
Go over there somewhere and ride Pierre Cardin (You rude)
And when you see that bum make sure you tell him I said that I sell dope
For all the times I was dead broke
Speaking of dead, when I die, I swear I'mma try, I'mma still try to sell dope, sell dope

There's no other life out here I know
So I guess I should...
Sell dope
This is the only life for me
So I...
Sell dope
The nights are long and cold
Long and cold
But out here on these streets you'd swear I had pure gold
Pure gold
In my hands I hold your hope
Nigga cause I...
Sell dope

This bitch told me I can't get them digits my nigga, my nigga, aw hell no
It's only one way I'mma fix this my nigga, that's sell dope
A fan asked me for a picture, I squatted down for a jail pose
Then I dashed before the flash could finish, I forgot I had to go sell dope
What news you got, if it ain't about selling dope, I can't take it
The doctor gave me five months to live, I told her "Nigga, I can't make it"
Tell whoever set my expiring date I had a prior engagement to sell dope
That's why I'm in every discussion, I could sell a whale a bucket
Of well water, I could sell Harriot Tubman a mothafuckin' railroad
I'm the flower with the thorn rising out the concrete, y'all just born on Melrose
I stay strapped, I stay strapped like velcro
When I meet new people I introduce myself as "I sell dope"
I just had a job interview, they asked if I ever been to jail before
I said "Yes" then I got up and left, like fuck this shit I'mma sell dope
Cause right now I'm dead broke
Speaking of dead, when I die, I swear I'mma try, I'mma still try to sell dope, I'mma try to sell dope

There's no other life out here I know
So I should...
Sell dope
This is the only life I know
The nights are long and cold
Long and cold
But out here on these streets you'd swear I had pure gold
Pure gold
In my hands I hold your hope
Nigga cause I...
Sell dope

America, America, God shed His grace on thee
America, America, when will we all be free?
(I say it every day of my life God bless America)
Somebody very dear to me just attempted to kill herself
And showed me we don’t fear death, we fear fear itself
Ever since 98 in hip hop my presence been felt
Couple dollars, couple models, couple of bitch niggas under my belt
Thorough nigga, I'mma hold you to it
If we hand shake my plan B is to complete plan A
Grindin been my strategy like this is my anatomy
I should get a tat on me that say why, why, why
Would you let some dollar dictate your army
I brush my shoulders up, polish off
Haters if you play me I’ll spray your potato layed up with fakers
I put them in the news in a major paper
My roller coaster of a career, hope it’s been real for you
Because it’s been weird for me, I feel like

They can take away the cars, they can take away the cash
But I bet you they can’t take the realness that's in me
I’ve been up, I’ve been down, I don’t give a fuck, yeah

I just want mama to be happy
Is that too mothafucking much to ask?
Damn it I’m about to cry in this bitch, king of the jungle
I hate liars but I fuck with a lioness bitch
If you don’t straighten your ass out right now
I will find you and iron you bitch
Grindin been my strategy like this is my anatomy
I should get a tat on me that say why, why, why
Would you let losses make you act like a faggot?
I’m a fly and you act like a maggot
Money comes money goes, I used to wear funny clothes
Hammer pants, my mama used to wipe my runny nose
My real family all I care about is her, I’m feelin' like


Then I watch my daddy hit my mama, listen to my mama
Tryna calm us, y'all don’t understand the problem that we have
Who gives a shit about dollars when you gotta go visit your father in rehab
You said Rick Ryan Marcus as long as I’m getting high your mama will be sad
And only I can fix this so I'mma turn this all around I promise
As we sat He said i’m down in life right now you know I'mma be back
And when he got back home it’s like it was heaven sent
Cause I was only 11 at the time and he's been clean and sober ever since
He gave me this advice, you at a huge advantage
Long as you know what’s rules in life and a view for the planet
Rather you the man, you’re the mechanic people treat money like oxygen
When they got it they take it for granted but then lose it and panic
So spoken G, I look at him like Superman
And y'all know niggas ain’t even close to me so if he can fall, so can we
Somebody lift me up, yeah
And give me a hand
Give me a ride, I'm sliding off the highway
There's a curve in the road
I don't know when I'm going, crazy


Verbalizing my theme murder
Communicating while you debating using machine squirters
Br-r-rat, that trigger's my tongue, I l-l-lick a nigga
That fo'-fifth'll,lift a nigga whole clique up
The Lord call for your soul, it's time to go, pick up
Answer the horn, it's blowing at you, you cold, stiff up
My heat, heating my whole hip up, all we do is court strippers
Your metal freezing like it's a morgue zipper
I, ride around with Preem
Not the Preem from Queens, but the Preem from "DWYCK"
'Bout to change the game, 'bout to fly the desert
Eagle for y'all people, like the wing's the clip
And the barrel's the beak, my apparel is fleece
I'm adorned in diamonds, I'm a pharaoh deceased
Like if Spawn was rhymin, and I would advise you
Not to tempt her, New Temptations, the gun harmonizing


Every bullet's a note, I write with a firing pen
Every time that trigger pull, it's a quote
Inside a booth fulla smoke, sniffin lines of that gunpowder
I'm hotter than a pair of boots and a coat
And a turtleneck, the best rapper alive
Could be the best rapper that died, I'm murderous
If you ain't get it by now, I'm suicidal, I'm wild
A nigga better than me, is who I ain't heard of yet
So I ain't murdered yet, he ain't even been born
His momma's a virgin, she ain't even fertile yet
Prepare to get back, next time you take a shit, stand and turn around and look in the toilet, then compare me to THAT!
Don't compare me to none of these muhfuckin' wannabe hustlers
Tough until they standing in front of me duckin'
It's off with yo' head nigga, 'less you one of them Dodgers
We sound off as one, we gun harmonize!


This shit is musical, my spit is beautiful
And if the best rapper died we'd be sitting at Nickel's funeral
But we ain't dying cause our trigger finger nail you
As quick as you clip a cuticle, hollows'll hit your follicles
I split your wig from far away like a long arm barber
Then lift your weight like a strong arm robber
Put that on Moses, I rely on my rod
As sure as Satan's tongue lying to God, everybody dying
It's like you standing in a circular firing squad
Singers for hire, I find him a job
You see the gauge baritone, the revolver's a tenor
Way the shots spin your body, I'ma call 'em "The Spinners"
Call 'em "Earth, Wind and Fire", put you beneath the earth, wind and fire
Feel the fire that burnt Richard Pryor
I'm keeping two guns, I named 'em Romeo and Juliet
Make you take five like you and your homies on the movie set
BLAOW!
Yeah, I got money on my mind, that's why I'm twice on my grind
I'm nice cause I rhyme like it's my life's on that line
The second that I'm provoked, I snap into a point
That ain't controllable, then it's either war, or another quotable
Don't let me get a hold of you dudes, I'll murder you on camera
Get Kelly's lawyer and get a mole removed
I probably shouldn't have said that, fuck y'all, on the record
Off the record, if I'm on the record I'ma off the record
I need a push when I'm tired of rhyming, go 'head
Diss me, 'cause me and George Bush got a lot in common
We both got no sense, we love to go to war
And we stay looking for weapons of mass destruction
This industry is Hilary Clinton literally, listen
You ain't got no choice now, roll with a nigga
If you twisted enough to picture a devil mixed with a angel
That's sick, drunk inside a Range Rov, that's this
Wish I could stick every rapper in this bitch in a building
Let 'em cypher while I fly a plane through that bitch
Cause I hate y'all, I'm tri-polar with the 8 ball
If I want you on my album, I pull out the K and make y'all
In case y'all wanna share my light, I'm gonna tell it like it is
Fuck it, it's my Jeremiah Wright
I'm a motherfucking problem, I don't care if y'all don't like
Times three nigga, I'm me nigga

I'm me, nigga

Big dick, bitch, big balls
We the kind that supply the rock like Chris Paul
The same kind that aim 9s, insane conscience
And then we get rid of the rock like Dwayne Johnson
Ladykiller, the fly version of Orenthal
You ain't got no DUIs then you probably a cornball
Wittiest, if you call a laptop a labtop
You sound like a scientist, but you probably a idiot
Your stories ain't holding up, y'all niggas lying
Got me thinking y'all either too young or y'all ain't old enough
Niggas saying, "When Royce gonna stop beefing with rappers?"
Bitch, when hell freeze over and Wayne sober up
By the way, fuck all DJs! I'm just kidding
I just threw that in there to get y'all attention
No intention of ever dying, nigga, life too sweet
Two words for who don't like me, "fight" and "me"
I take care of my family, they say
"Do the kid rock like Pam Lee?" The answer is yes
And I invest, it takes money to make money
So I make green off Green like Stan Lee
Smart shit, I ain't got beef with no Joe Budden
Y'all gon' get one of these niggas killed trying to start shit
Niggas hire muscle 'cause living is a privilege
The only rapper I admire for his strength is Xzibit

I killed it, right away
Soon as you cross, go 'head, you got the right-a-way
Give a nigga iron like vitamin, play
I will ride up in broad day and night a nigga day
Drunk! I'm a recovering outpatient
You at the top, you shot, your spot is now taken
Psychotic is the ploy, how the fuck you rapping and you gay
And you've been spotted with a boy like a Dalmatian?
If I switch up, I'd probably be instantly selling
Got a clip full of pellets known as MC repellent
While you talkin  bout your money and how I can't have none of it
I'll hit a nigga low, just for the Zab fun of it
I will never lose, never lost, I'mma prove it
Except for my virginity, but I was trying to lose it
I be on some Tom Cruise shit standing on the couch
In the club, laughing bout my dime new chick
She the shit, but if you ask her she useless, I'm in the pocket
'Cause got a rocket down under like Houston
So I'm gonna keep being me and you should keep being you
If being you offends me, indeed, it's gonna be me and you
But understand that if it's that, it's either gonna be me or you
So pump your brakes before I do you like a got a key to you
Shut your power off, I'm a G-A-N-G
S-T-ARR, yes, we are, bitch, I'm *gunshot*
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh, oh yeah

See I done said so much (so much)
I done said so much that I don't even got that much to say
I done cried so much (so much)
I done cried so much that I can't even wipe the tears away
Quiet

That’s how it be when you come up around gangsters (Quiet)
Silence be the same color my chain is (quiet)
That’s how it be coming up on my block (quiet)
Silence be the same color of my watch (quiet)

Hold up, shhh, keep your mouth shut
Them street sweepers will come through and clean your house up
Us Detroit niggas call that yellow-taping the scene
My south niggas call it chalked up, you know
We put money on it when it's real, they call me Mr. Fifty a head
I'm sending ten niggas to kill ya at ten until
Every man got an expiration date and a price
All my revolvers got the spinnin' wheel
I make the Lord you pray to appear tonight like Vanna White
Them racketeering charges startin' to look like a tennis deal
I caught it, garden in my backyard guarding the weed and lookin' like some spinnish spiel, but still I'm dealin' raw
From selling to buying weed, actually I'm stealin' all
I'm the last of a dying breed that I'm out here killing off
Four of my closest friends don't know their papas so I pull out rows of dollars to show 'em these real forefathers peelin' off
Get money

See I done said so much (so much)
I done said so much that I don't even got that much to say
I done cried so much (so much)
I done cried so much that I can't even wipe the tears away
Quiet

That’s how it be when you come up around gangsters (Quiet)
Silence be the same color my chain is (quiet)
That’s how it be coming up on my block (quiet)
Silence be the same color of my watch (quiet)

Shhh, I should have been born deaf mute
Talkin' get you stripped naked
Shootin' at your feet, dancin', till Chippendales at your rescue
If there's a wrinkle then there's iron to press you
Look, time is money, I'm on EST
Keep playin, light up your block like Christmas E-v-e
I'm the new edition of poison: BBD
For that bread my niggas will stamp you: EBT
I let a hot line sting 'em, you and the cops while I'm singin'
Ever since you left the city, now they hotline's blingin', hmm
Seen a paddy wagon cruisin' and I'm deducin'
That they are only movin' cause all the rumors that you in
If I had to draw a conclusion all the gangsters we losing is
Because of the illusion, you are not in collusion
With the boys that's wearin' blue and it's causing all this confusion
And they wouldn't even know, but y'all tellin' what niggas doin'

See I done said so much (so much)
I done said so much that I don't even got that much to say
I done cried so much (so much)
I done cried so much that I can't even wipe the tears away
Quiet

That’s how it be when you come up around gangsters (Quiet)
Silence be the same color my chain is (quiet)
That’s how it be coming up on my block (quiet)
Silence be the same color of my watch (quiet)

I'm going on an AK-a-thon
Throw a Bible at some shallow waters right before I go and pray upon
Double parked, custom license plates says I can pay a fine
I ain't in the zone, I'm in the mother fuckin' lay-up line
Speaking of lay ups, we do homi's based on how we doin'
Last lay up line I was in was a body viewin'
I'm preoccupied with the Earth's ills, good 'erbals
First meal was milk, I milk these niggas for my first meal
Full circle, off of just talking I can tell types
But I still give that bitch my whip test
If she not exhausted then she can easily tailpipe
Playin' that dirty hand I was dealt, don't complain to me nigga, tell Christ
I'm standing over coffins with hammers and screws, with a sickness
Man a cure wouldn't hand a nigga these nails right
Only hand-me-down I had was inherited head lice
But nothing's more bugged out as my head size, I live twice
E'ery day, one for the body of Martin Luther King, I'm dead nice
Rest call me Malcolm, they want me dead because I'm dead right
Ask me to spell die, I'mma accidentally spell dice
I can shelve a label with my shelf life
I'm a rider, but still I steal bikes
Out of the field, terrorizing reptiles and field mice
I'm cut like I'm touched, a blind man with braille spikes
I'm deep, I could break up a mother fuckin' whale fight

See I done said so much (so much)
I done said so much that I don't even got that much to say
I done cried so much (so much)
I done cried so much that I can't even wipe the tears away
Quiet

That’s how it be when you come up around gangsters (Quiet)
Silence be the same color my chain is (quiet)
That’s how it be coming up on my block (quiet)
Silence be the same color of my watch (quiet)
(Ryan!) I am not trying to be in the store all day
Y'all can play the game one time
Lemme go get change for a dollar real quick
Hey my man, what's up, you got change for a dollar?
What's up, man? You don't remember me, do you?
(Ryan!) I remember you, I remember you definitely
I remember you took my basketball and wouldn't give it back
'Cause I dribbled it inside the store but I was just messing with you
Plus that was my lucky ball
My Dad got it signed by Isaiah Thomas so I kept it with me

Everywhere I went I used to bounce that ball
Everywhere I used to go I used bounce that, bounce that ball
I'm little Ryan from 16650 Baylis
Remember me? I used to buy all the mystery mix Now and Laters
I used to wait for God to come down and answer all my prayers

Never asked for much when I sat down and say my prayers
All I ever, ever wanted was to be amazing (Ryan!)

Same little boy used to walk to the corner store
Who used to get the Funyun chips, who ended up, dumb, young and rich
I had young parents but they both were strict
I had a superstitious granddad, wait, scratch that, crazy granddad
I seen him turn his hat around three times
Drive his car around the corner three times in reverse
Just 'cause he crossed paths with a black cat
Man, you remember Hank? He used to be a Jitney at the market
My Mom used to do his laundry
He used to have me and my brothers dyin' laughin' at him
Talkin' 'bout, "You know you can't leave them clothes
In the washing machine too long when they get done washed
And still put 'em in the dryer, doing that makes the clothes stink"
Damn, being back here bring back so many memories
You sure you don't remember me? You remember the ball? (Ryan!)
Everywhere I went I used to bounce that ball
Everywhere I used to go I used to bounce that, bounce that ball
Nigga, everybody know little Ryan from 17150 Northlawn
I used to come and cop pork rinds
I used to watch drug dealers come through in cars
Like, "If I get one of those, it's showtime"

Never asked for much when I sat down and say my prayers
All I ever, ever wanted was to be amazing (Ryan!)

Is that Ryan? Is it always good to see him in the neighborhood
Hey, baby! How your momma?
Look at that car, he done done it
I told y'all he was gonna do somethin' (Ryan!)
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Hell yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Hell yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey (Ryan!)

Wow, this is overwhelin'
It feels like it was just yesteday I was watchin' "Good Times"
Wishin' I could get ahold of Thelma
Fighting with my brother over channels
I like watchin' movies
He likes stupid shit like Robin Williams goin', "Nanu nanu"
Whatever that stupid ass show called
I ain't around here being no attention whore
I need niggas to look at these whips for every time we got those extension cords
God, I miss my big brother so much
He went to prison so much that I don't think I'd recognize him these days much
But I'ma always know what to get him from the ice cream truck
He used to get the Push-up Pops, I used to get the snow cone
I used to wanna be just like Turbo, he used to want to be Ozone
I got all the kids wavin' at me, all the elderly off they high horse
They wouldn't even let a nigga play twenty-one in the driveway
Nowadays the ball is in the my court (Ryan!)
Everywhere I went I used to bounce that ball
Everywhere I used to go I used bounce that, bounce that ball
Everybody going, "Ain't that—little Ryan, from over there on Morlow?
I ain't seen him since he was a baby"
Well I'm back in town to let the people know
That you don't need no lucky ball, you already amazing
And I'm still your neighbor, little ol' Ryan (Ryan!)

And God bless the child no matter
How long it seems, somehow he'll find his way home
It's so important baby
Between the memories and family, I don't know which one is more amazing

Never asked for much when I sat down and say my prayers
All I ever, ever wanted was to be amazing
Then I keep my .40 Glock on me. This has no safety on it, it's fully loaded, there's one in the chamber at all times, so that means if I need to, I just aim and squeeze

Everywhere I go, them niggas know I'm ready for combat
All you ever gonna find in my DNA is combat
Everywhere I go, these niggas know I'm ready for combat
Nothing but violence and rage in my DNA - it's combat

I don't got comrades
I just ride with the gun, cash, and a good girl that's gone bad
I don't have to have a hit, shit could be a bunt
I'm ready for combat
This ain't really what you want
And I ain't really fascinated with your 'Benz price
Fall back and get your car jacked while the engine masturbate the twin pipe
I beat you down
Only time you heard about me backing up is the armoured truck beeping sound
Instead of battle rapping with you, I'd rather speak in rounds
True veteran, Sickening flow you couldn't do better than
Show up to your crib, dig a six foot hole, introduce you to your new residence
Y'all what all the flash and all the autographs about
Y'all niggas actin' like broads is all your fault, that Remy Ma the hardest rapper out
Y'all only do music with people 'cos they hot, so your point is stupid
I just wanna stay the fuck away from you and do a joint or two with Joyner Lucas
Shut the game down
Show you you ain't shit when I come through
Don't even flinch at me - I'm James Brown
You ain't built to fit in that jump suit
I'm super strapped with a rocket launcher - Google that
Lay a hand on me
I'll spray you and your homie
Have you land on him like Scoob and Scrap
I'm in the streets where the movers at
Y'all industry, y'all industries where the Ubers at
I'm ruthless black like Dr Dre crew
Rae Carruth in a topless grey coupe
Got the K cocked, stay true
The roof is back, get in the car
Never been a star, but I'm blessed
I found a girl who love me almost as much as Peter Rosenberg loves Kendrick Lamar
I'm just tryna be the one who finally make Rihanna faithful
Was I the only one heartbroken when I found out French Montana fucked Sanaa Lathan?
And I promise y'all I'm not a hater; I'm just aggravated
I just want all my hoes who don't know that they my hoes yet to act their ages
I just want to drive all my hoes crazy like the one that played That's So Raven
Back to back with me blasting iron, ratchet waving
Caps flying like we had a graduation

Everywhere I go, them niggas know I'm ready for combat
All you ever gonna find in my DNA is combat
Everywhere I go, these niggas know I'm ready for combat
(5, 4, 3, 2, 1)


I got real nigga in my DNA
I be killing at will
I'm the illest that live
Fuck a deal, fuck a VMA
I beef, y'all mediate
Y'all PDA, I'm TNA
Soon as one of y'all step by the bar I alleviate
Niggas must want death by tomorrow, if you trying war with me today
Y'all niggas story long, not me; I abbreviate:
I innovate
I'm NBA
Y'all CBA
Gettin' paid my TV rate
My reality BDP
Evil D, I'm CTJ
Y'all DVD
Y'all reality Stevie J
Y'all trying to box with a nigga that'll beat your ass, but I'd much rather beat a case
Just shine your light on the world
So shine your light on the world
No matter anywhere you go, keep
Shining your light on the world
Don't let the money make you thirsty
Don't even let it be your goal
Just let it come and keep on working
And shine your light on them hoes
Cause I'm the hardest nigga out here
I'd rather die than live a life of fear
I know I got to be down here
To shine my light on them hoes
Hardest nigga out here
I'd rather starve than live a life of fear
I feel like God sent me down here
To shine my light on them hoes

Lost in the world when me and my girlfriend meet, bless you
You know they say "if you fucked her and she didn't cum
And you came, then she fucked you"
We squeeze first, nigga these ain't rebuttals
These street sweepers, we dump til he jump brooms
Like these nuptials, in the D where dreams come true
This is the the story of a man who's trying to break his doubts
Down like his cases count
Obsessive compulsive counting dough
Making sure all the numbers on the inside
And all the faces out
Lawyers on retainers like they braces out
Say my name wrong, I make you taste your mouth
Money come, money go
Get it but don't splurge it
Your boy's greed and war's needs
Got their own purpose
There's more than four speeds on that Porsche Turbo
It's sitting on four G's like my phone service
I'm out here trapping, but this here's sincere rapping
Dear assassin, you can't kill a signed and sealed classic
Cause L's and bill blasts, snake skin troops
Reptile enemies X'd out is what make men true
I'm blacking just like Jamaicans do
I'm running long side your coupe
Tapping guns upon your Wrathe window
Like Ox in Belly, got more Glocks and cellies
Than New Yorks got blocks and delis
Cops and boxes of pirellis, their doors' ajar
Exposing  my maserati's guts
And that's what got you jelly
The car I'm driving got a pot belly

I'm out here trapping
With this here sincere rapping
I've been shooting straight
Since two inch tape
This is for real classic
And getting money was never part of my goals
It just came along with me shining my light on them hoes
I've been out here trapping
With this here sincere rap
For fifteen years, I ain't leaving here without a classic
I get money, get money money dough
All I came to do is shine my light on them hoes

Hip-hop is my house; watch these philosophies win
Around artists I stand out like I locked my keys in
I forgot my goal at twenty-three was make a classic
Walk away like Tiger with my nine iron then take the master's
They say that you get what you ask for
Well, I asked to be left alone with my pen, pad and passport
This ain't no rags to rich brag shit
In fact, it's more close to being a rich to rags story
The fabric I'm cut from's the most genuine article mankind offers
I'm like an underground landmine talking
For Storch, Hammer & Antoine Walker
And your boy's a tampon
In every store I'm anti-corporate
Highest exalted, call me commercial? I'm highly insulted
This is Royce da 5'9", mind body and soul shit
All I have in this fucking globe is my shotty and flow
I'd rather let the coroner outline my body in chalk
Than let the fans order me 'round the clock and buy me in bulk

I'm out here trapping
With this here sincere rapping
I've been shooting straight
Since two inch tape
This is for real classic
And getting money was never part of my goals
It just came along with me shining my light on them hoes
I've been out here trapping
With this here sincere rap
For fifteen years, I ain't leaving here without a classic
I get money, get money money dough
All I came to do is shine my light on them hoes

We move in silence, y'all ain't hearing us coming
I was sent by God to provide that imperial sonnage
Ya'll assembly line of rhymers really don't want it
I'll eat you for breakfast, one by one I got ya'll serial numbers
I'm about to send a tweet out to my nigga Styles
Tell him he got the juice now
Call my OG Scarface, talk some boxing with him
Perhaps these new clowns, politic perhaps
About a new him and Royce track
I'm feeling like D to the O to the C
When he got his voice back
Ha, I'm feeling like Cube in a fresh El Camino
Rolling key low g rolling through Detroit's back
Streets waving to all my people
I'm feeling more at home than Reese Taylor
This are what memories are made of
I remember each grudge, each favor
Each lie, each judge, each bailiff
Each job, cheap labor
Each neighbor, each caper
Each Mosque, each Church
Each pastor, pew, and casket
Each future bastard double dutching  through the madness, singing:

Just shine your light on the world
So shine your light on the world
No matter anywhere you go, kid
Shining your light on the world
Don't let the money make you thirsty
Don't even let it be your goal
Just let it come and keep on working
And shine your light on the hoes
Cause I'm the hardest nigga out here
I'd rather die than live a life of fear
I know I got to be down here
To shine my light on them hoes
Hardest nigga out here
I'd rather starve than live a life of fear
I feel like God sent me down here
To shine my light on them hoes
Never write about me like that
Never make me stick to one, it’ll just make me angry
Never ever make me no underdog
And never talk about who’s gonna stop me!
Ain’t nobody gonna stop me!
Ain’t a heavyweight in the world fast enough to stop me

Yeah, I survived a lot of savage shit
I’ve been vibing like it’s Attica
Bulletproof glass is on my ride, ride around here like the Vatican
I’m an addict, I personify arrogance
I believe you can speak some shit into existence, deleted my 9 to 5 narrative
Now I got a bitch so fine half the time I fuck her, rest the time I just stare at her
Letting the non-believers know I don’t need to go diamond Ryan, it’s forever bruh
I’m a level up from buying stilettos to impress em
Got em blindfolded, tying em up in leather like I’m Edward Scissorhands in some boxing gloves
Hitting it just as if the chick was with the S&M S&M, I ain’t never stressin em y'all are the nervous wrecks
With ya ho fucking me, both hands stroking the pole looking like she tryna roll up a sleeve, I call it the turtleneck
Next, I blow out her back while she sitting vertical on top of dick in a convertible
Call the shit murder the vertebrae then drop her off at the crib with vertigo
I done seen it all, been through it all so you know I know what is what
The smallest part of beef is gon always be all the things you utter bruh
My sense is keen and I got that ivory weighing on the triple beam while I dish a queen
The bitch got the Arsenio Hall from “In Living Color” butt
I got your baby mama hyperactive, piping her while she asking the lord in Michael Blackson accent “Lord, what in the mother fuck?”
My mind is so much more enlightening, who be tryna throw shade? I’m over here just destroying y'all sun
And this is what you call in y’all bag, then I’m in a Goyard trunk
Baby I’m getting cash money, getting the last laugh, the last word too
I’ma need my headstone to say “y'all finished or y'all done?”
Bar Exam 4 y'all, the there is no competition edition
No features, nobody scratching on it, this the I just been itchin’ edition
Ballin’ like I’m in the A-Town with Terio in the bleachers
Y'all are karaoking with Dirty Harry, tearing your stereo into pieces
Y'all need to take a soul searching class
The Slaughterhouse album I’d like to drop it, the New Edition biopic came out and now Joe wanna be Bobby so fucking bad
I’m just joking with my good friend, I’m just so in my happy place
I just know from my head to my toe I’m the greatest, y'all can keep ya ho and ya accolades
Dr. Dre taught me to not oversaturate before he offered me a deal
Right before I got another offer for a dollar amount you know that I had to take
And now that all of that shit is clearly behind us, y'all really expect me to regret being 19 and going and getting a million dollars?
Nigga fuck you, that’s a million dollars, still a million dollars
Nigga that’s 20 million nickels, that equals 20 bitches and an island
Now you’re talking unlimited dimes, and a hundred million pennies
Now do I wanna pitch it down? Hell yeah nigga that’s a million dollars
Now can you get the fuck over it? Please, consider respecting me, I’m willing to fucking pistol bust over it
As a kid I used to just be looking pitiful
A lot of my courses were difficult, so of course the teacher would tell me I ain’t bout to be too much more than just a custodian
And that gave me a complex I’m still stricken with I call the shit the Napoleon
When I walk in the kitchen now I want the ho to kiss the toe and lick the linoleum
All my old bitches before you slit your wrists if you can’t stomach it get some Imodium
Gassin’ bitches and spittin’ petroleum
The only actual difference between me and the Holy Spirit is the Trinity and the podium
Nickel Hallelujah
Nickel-9ne-Alooya
Nickel-9ne-Alooya
Hallelujah nigga Hallelujah
Nickel-9ne-Alooya
Summertime were the funnest times
Momma used to had to say come inside like a hunnid times
Flat booty, big titty bitches just on they grind
My nigga Moody used to say they was built like the number nine
Hah, wish I could be childish for old times
Either y'all were Tranzor Z or y'all were Voltron
Stole bikes with Ike until the time that he stole mine
Told mom, she told me, "What comes 'round goes 'round"

Stop, right (right there)
I never said that life, was fair (fair)

Look, we had our best times when momma and papa went out
And someone like my auntie would watch us
She just smoked weed and want not to be bothered
We go and leave the house to not be by her
She was our favorite, she never would holler
She get high and give out several dollars
Every time she get the camera, she'd tell me to smile
Knowin' damn well I was never no smiler

Stop, right (right there)
I never said that life, was fair (fair)

"Hey girl, how you doing?
Yeah, Greg's in there getting dressed, how are the children?
I see you got you a new car
You know just gettin' along, gettin' along
Ryan is doin' well, uh, girl I gotta go Greg is callin' me
It was good talkin' to you baby
I can't stand that bitch, ugh"

I said stop, right (right there)
I never said that life, was fair (fair)

Look, same girl that Momma just was talkin' all fake to
Used to borrow our papers, and all of our things
She was always ungrateful, always had bad news
Always into the latest gossip
Always was tryna show our father her nudes, that shit's not cool
One day we went out in town and they broke the door down
On our house and stole all of our food
Stole from us, we ain't have much more than you

Stop, uh
Stop right there
You know when karma catch you
Everything in your life goin' fail
You gon' be a failure
You gon' be a failure
Said you gon' be a failure
You gon' be a failure
We gotta move
Die, bitch, die, hoe
New God flow, no I go
Diablo, why, hoe?
Why, bitch, do time tick?
Think about it, you die slow
If not you die quick
I’m sicker than Theraflu
Wickeder than a kick over headstone
Sippin' on redrum
After I'm finished just swimmin' inside of the dead pool
After I'm finished just inflictin' on the guy a despicable head wound
Nothin' is important, but to import tons
On my fourth run while I'm eatin' lunch with my forked tongue
I swing this motherfuckin' barrel loose
I don't fuck with knives, nigga, I'm Sardo Numsie
Y'all niggas call the police on my people regardless
Rock a bye with my piece then call it Keisha in Harlem
I'm the highest of all beings, my eye is the all-seeing
Dribblin' fireballs with lion paws for my audience

What if the Devil played the banjo?
What if he invited you out on the dance floor?
There's one of six million different ways this can go

Ayo, your fishscale Fisher-Price
First shot killed a nigga, but I hit him twice
My trigger finger itchin' like it was lice
Sent the white in a pot with the ice, whipped it nice
Hurricane whipped the whole slag
Fiend hit the glass, hit his ass, you know the math
I toe tag me a nigga, you know I spaz
I throw a bag to my young nigga, he'll get it over fast
G-wag, 24 karat
Silencer on the Mac 12, you ain't even hear it
Lightning strikin' on the Neil Barrett
Fuck nigga don't get embarrassed
Fuck your two Sarah's out in Paris
Bitch nigga, your life, you better cherish
Ten shooters show up to your show just to air it
Griselda, the dinner place swingin'
Body in the Bentley truck, shit reakin'

What if the Devil played the banjo?
What if he invited you out on the dance floor?
There's one of six million different ways this can go
(So go fast)

Eyes are the windows to the soul, what your secret is?
Once had to battle the reaper, and I ethered him
No tellin' what I'll sing on the mic, he got reefer in 'em
Ghost guts, I can see a ghost, and speak to 'em
Buildin' with the dead like every other night
And I never write a rhyme, I recite my other life
You thinkin' this a verse, but it's more of a testimonial
So flow, up in the zone, only the lonely know
Thinkin' I'm geekin', but I'm reachin' my dead homies, though
Told 5'9 if I have a nine to five
I'll line rappers with the nine and rob em five times
Every day, seven days a week, call it crime time or
Thirty-five licks, nigga, that's a prime rhyme
Fightin' Bruce Lee's demon, but I'm agin' like fine wine
You don't understand me
Cause you don't stand under the code that mean family
Ghost is uncanny

What if the Devil played the banjo?
What if he invited you out on the dance floor?
There's one of six million different ways this can go
I made a choice (woo!), I'm rolling with Royce (yeah yeah)
Ooh yeah, yeah (yeah, woo woo!)
Everything is everything but I need a better ring
I'm married to the game so I got both of us wedding rings
On every finger, T-Pizzle the wedding singer
We only make head bangers, I'm leavin' 'em dead and I ain't scared

It's the first of the month, I got my bag in the mail
I was panickin' yesterday, now I'm happy as hell
We on (I just do what I do)
We on, yeah (I just do what I do)
It's the first of the month, I got my bag in the mail
I'm turnin' back up my radio
I hope I never be alone (I just do what I do)
Be alone, yeah (I just do what I do)

Said it's the first of the month, got bitches callin' my phone
Just payed a couple of bills, just got some shit cut back on
I gave my momma some money so she can go out and gamble
God only put on me, what he know that I can handle
But it's the first of the month, I'm puttin' some rims on my car
My lady said it's a waste, bullshit I'm a star
Leave me alone
She jealous anytime I'm gon' shine
She said, "If you so talented why, nobody ain't ever heard of ya?"
She dumps me on the 20th, takes me back by the 30th
She's wrong
But we been together such a long time

It's the first of the month, I got my bag in the mail
I was panickin' yesterday, now I'm happy as hell
We on (I just do what I do)
We on, yeah (I just do what I do)
It's the first of the month, I got my bag in the mail
I'm turnin' back up my radio
I hope I never be alone (I just do what I do)
Be alone, yeah (I just do what I do)

Ayyy, my life's like Heaven
That's from the first of the month until the seventh
And from the seventeenth to the end, it's like Heaven
We go from buying back to selling
Ayyy, I live like a king
By way of delivery of a mailman
Oh no no, hello

I'm tryna' be loyal to never going broke again
The money, the power, respect is my only three friends
So I put a ring on the game, I'ma put a chain on it later
Now I got the hang of the game, I'ma make it rain for ya baby
Now, I put the work in (I put the work in)
So if anybody asks about me, just tell 'em I'm workin' (tell 'em I'm workin')
If you not talkin' 'bout money then you get the "do not disturb" then (do not disturb)
Talk down on the game, get one of them nerves in
Uh, if I ever fucked up a friendship—I'm sorry (sorry)
Money don't buy happiness, I go and cry in a Ferrari (skrt)
We get kicked out the room, I'ma move the shit down to the lobby (yeah)
'Cause I got my bag in the mail, I'm happy as hell, bitch it's time to party
And it's the first of the month

It's the first of the month, I got my bag in the mail
I was panickin' yesterday, now I'm happy as hell
We on (I just do what I do)
We on, yeah (I just do what I do)
It's the first of the month, I got my bag in the mail
I'm turnin' back up my radio
I hope I never be alone (I just do what I do)
Be alone, yeah (I just do what I do)

Ayyy, my life's like Heaven
That's from the first of the month until the seventh
And from the seventeenth to the end, it's like Heaven
We go from buying back to selling
Ayyy, I live like a king
By way of delivery of a mailman (I just do what I do)
And we on, yeah (I just do what I do)
It's the first of the month
So cash your checks and come on
It's the first of the month
So cash your checks and come on
It's the first of the month
So cash your checks and come on
It's the first of the month
So cash your checks and come on

There's gon' be some stuff you gon' see
That's gon' make it hard to smile in the future
But through whatever you see
Through all the rain and the pain
You gotta keep your sense of humor
You gotta be able to smile through all this bullshit
Remember that!
Mmm, yeah, keep ya head up! Yeah

Our lifestyles be close-captioned, addicted to fatal attractions
Pictures of actions be played back in the midst of mashin'
No fairy tales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales
Hustlers hardly think of culture
Or the repercussions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures
Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars, and bitches
Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears? Save your sympathy
My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetary
Here's a message to the newborns waitin' to breathe
If you believe, then you can achieve: just look at me!
Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on
Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me, protect your essence
Born with less, but you still precious; just smile for me now!

Smile for me, won't you smile? (Smile for me now)
Just smile, smile for me (Smile)
(What you lookin' all sad for?
Nigga, you black, smile for me now)
Smile for me
(Nigga, you ain't got nothin' to be worried about)
Won't you smile? (No doubt, smile for me now)
Just smile (And the next generation)

Now, as I open up my story, with the blaze of your blunts
And you can picture thoughts slowly, up on phrases I wrote
And I can walk you through the days that I done
I often wish that I could save everyone, but I'm a dreamer
Have you ever seen a nigga who was strong in the game
Overlookin' his tomorrows, and they finally came?
Look back on childhood memories, and I'm still feelin' the pain
Turnin' circles in my 9th grade, dealin' cocaine
Too many hassles in my local life, survivin' the strain
And a man without a focus, life could drive him insane
Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin' it change
But when I focus on reality we broke and in chains
Had a dream of livin' wealthy and makin' it big
Over football chose to cook raw, wouldn't take but I did
And after all my momma's thankin' God for blessin' the child
All my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile; smile!

Smile for me, won't you smile?
Just smile, smile for me
Smile for me
Won't you smile? Just smile

Fuck the world, as we elope and witness furious speeds
Unanswered questions keep us all stressin', curious G's
Backstabbed and bleedin'
Crooked thoughts laced with weed, learnin'
Duckin' stray shots, bullets be hot, they burnin'
Inhalin' sherm smoke, visualize the flames
Will I be smothered by my own pain?
Strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to diss us
Takin' pictures for the feds in desperate hopes they'd get us
Hit us off, give us plenty centuries
Forgive my sins, since I entered many penitentiaries
The best revenge is "Fuck friends!" – we military minded soldiers
Bustin' shots blindly, tryin' to find Jehovah
To help me, somebody save me, lost and crazy
Scared to drop a seed hopin' I ain't cursed my babies
Maybe now niggas feel me now, picture my pain
Embrace my words, make the world change
And still I smile, nigga

And now a moment of silence, let us pray
And as you journey into outerspace
May the angels help to lead the way
May the prayers that our families made
Shine up on your soul to keep you safe
And all the homies that done passed away
They there to greet you as you pass the gates
And as you headed to the tunnel's light
I hope it leads to eternal life
We say the prayers for our homie 'Pac

Smile, smile for me
All you need to do is smile
Woooo smile for me
Come on, smile for me
Talk to me man…
This ya boy Young Hova, yo, turn the muh'fuckin noise up
We can get right into the proceedings this evening
Headphones are distortin', bring it down a lil' bit
Okay, now we workin' wit it
The boy Face up in Baseline (Face Mob!)
Welcome to New York City
It’s ya boy Young Hov' (chyea!)
Kanye West on the track
Chi-Town, what’s goin' on now?
Can I talk to y'all for a minute?
Lemme talk to y'all for a minute
(Just gimme a minute of ya time baby, I don’t want much)
Lemme talk to these muh'fuckas, uhh

Guess who's bizack? You still smellin' crack in my clothes
Don't make me have to relapse on these hoes
Take it back out to taxing them road; when I was huggin' it
Niggas couldn't do nuttin' with it, straight from the oven with it
Came from the dirt, I emerged from it all
Without a stain on my shirt; you can blame my old earth
For the shit she instilled in me, still with me, pain plus work
Shit, she made me milk this game for all it's worth
That's right, these niggas can't fuck with me
I'm calling guts every time, drag my nuts every time, homie
We make a great combination, don't we?
Me and the Face Mob, every time we face-off
Face it, y'all, y'all niggas playing basic-ball
I'm on the block like I'm eight feet tall
Homey, I'm in the drop with the AC on
That's why the streets embrace me dawg, I'm so cool

Guess who's bizack? Back on the block with them O's
Face Mob, Mack Mittens and Hov'
Don't make me relapse, back to the block with the four
Cause this street shit is all I know

From the womb to the tomb, a hot pot a jar and a spoon
Trying to make me forty thousand and move
Motels, star-studded, rock stars and goons
Plain clothes wanna run in my room (woooo)
But nigga guess who's bizack? It's ya boy Face Mob
Started with an eightball, gotta get this cake dawg
Give niggas a break, nah; you know how the game go
Fuck you think I slang for? To go against the grain? No
I'm out here in grind mode, wrapped up in the paper chase
I wanna fuck a fine ho and candy-paint the 88
Don't got no wholesale, cause that ain't how I wanna run it
Here, take these five stones and bring a nigga back a hundred
Gotta set my feet dude, you do shit a fiend do
The fire get too hot in the kitchen, I hit the streets, fool
Money is an issue and that's on the fo' shizzle my nizzle
Ya block warm, and I come by with the fizzle
And make fo' sho' I get to work mines, a car at a time
We go to war and you ain't making a dime (haha!)
Cause I got shit to lose; a nigga out here paying his dues
My baby walking, gotta get him some shoes
It's a new game brewin', lemme give ya the rules
Get out of line and I'mma give ya the blues
It's a new game goin', lemme give ya the rules
Get out of line and I'mma give ya the blues, whoa (haha!)

Guess who's bizack? The boy B. Mizack, AKA Mr. Crack-A-Brick
Turn a whole one from a half a brick, look I mastered this
You can smell it once the plastic rips
A hot plate'll make ya swell up if ya gas get clipped
You can make ya chips swell up, you don't have to pitch
Play them corners like a safety, watch the traffic switch
Young'n never pump fake, and you'll get past the blitz
And keep ya whole hood on flip, like old box-spring
Pissy mattress shit, low old box of things
Strictly glassy shit, I hug the block like quarter water
Shit, I used to hug a corner like a old deuce and a quarter
Til' like deuce in the morning, with the old heads (uh!)
Slangin' loose quarters, this Philly cat back at it
Still fuckin' with em crack addicts, still bustin' with that black-matic

Guess who's bizack? Back on the block with them O's
Face Mob, Mack Mittens and Hov'
Don't make me relapse, back to the block with the four
Cause this street shit is all I know
(So what you gonna do when you get outta here cat daddy?)
I don't know dawg. I'm just trying to live it one day at a time, ya know?
(I hear you talkin' man, live it one day at a time...)
(It ain't nothing but a thang though, bro)
Yeah I hear you fool...
Well let me get up outta here, my ride out here waitin' for me
(Alright cat daddy, take it easy baby)
You stay up fool
(Peace)

He greets his father with his hands out
Rehabilitated slightly, but glad to be the man's child
The world is different since he's seen it last
Out of jail, been seven years and he's happy that he's free at last
All he had was his mother's letters
Now he's mobile and he's gotta make a change and make it for the better
But he's black so he's got one strike against him
And he's young, plus he came up in the system
But he's smart and he's finally making eighteen
And his goal's to get on top and try to stay clean
So he's calling up his homie who done came up
Livin' lavish, now they dealin' with the same stuff
And had that attitude that who he was was worth land
And with that fucked up attitude he killed his first man
Now it's different, he done did dirt
And realized killin' men meant comin' up but it still hurt
And can't nobody change this
It's 1994 and we up against the same shit
I never understood why
I could never see a man cry 'til I seen a man die

Imagine life at it's full peak
Then imagine lying dead in the arms of your enemy
Imagine peace on this Earth when there's no grief
Imagine grief on this Earth when there's no peace
Everybody's got a different way of endin' it
And when your number comes for souls, then they send it in
Now your time has arrived for your final test
I see the fear in your eyes and hear your final breath
How much longer will it be 'til it's all done?
Total darkness at ease be at all one
I watch him die and when he dies let us celebrate
You took his life, but your memory you'll never take
You'll be headed to another place
And the life you used to live will reflect in your mother's face
I still gotta wonder why
I never seen a man cry 'til I seen a man die

I hear you breathin' but your heart no longer sounds strong
But you kinda scared of dying so you hold on
And you keep on blacking out and your pulse is low
Stop trying to fight the reaper, just relax and let it go
Because there's no way you can fight it though you'll still try
And you can try it 'til you fight it but you'll still die
Your spirits leave your body and your mind clears
The rigor mortis starts to set, now you outta here
You start your journey into outer space
You see yourself in the light but you're still feeling outta place
So you standing in the tunnel of eternal life
And you see the ones you never learn to love in life
Make the choice, let it go if you can back it up
If you ain't at peace with God you need to patch it up
But if you ready, close your eyes and we can set it free
Here lies a man not scared to die, may he rest in peace
I still got to wonder why
I never seen a man cry 'til I seen that man die
Everyday it's been the same old thang on my block
You either working or you slanging cocaine on my block
You had to hustle, cause that's how we was raised on my block
And you stayed on your hop until you made you a knot
On my block, to hang out was the thing back then
And even when you left out, you came back in
To my block, from Holloway, Bellfort, to Scott
Reed Road to Phlox, we know the spots
Smoke weed and rocks, drink all the blue dots
On yo' block you prolly bred a Fat Pat or 2Pac
Or Big Pun, or B.I., ya homeboys from knee-high
And even when it was storming outside, that nigga'd be by
That's me, dogg, on my block, I ain't have to play the big shot
Niggas knew me back when I was stealing beers from Shamrock
And my nickname was Creepy, if Black June could see me
He'd be tripping - and I'd bet he still try to tease me

My block - where everything is everything for sheezy
My block - we probably done it all homey believe me
My block - we made the impossible look easy, for sheezy
My block - I'd never leave my block, my niggas need me

On my block, we duck the nigga-haters and the cops
Fuck a IROC, we race Impalas, chromed-out
On my block - it ain't no different than the next block
Ya get drunk and pass out, and they back ya to the house
And when you wake up on the couch you going right back at it
On my block when ya that fucked up they laugh at it
On my block, it's just another day in the heart
Of the Southside of Houston Texas, making your mark
On my block, we're cuing all the time, playing dominoes
Keep the Swishers sweet down until my Mama goes
Back inside -- then we can fire
Pass it around a few times to get high

My block - where everything is everything for sheezy
My block - we probably done it all homey believe me
My block - we made the impossible look easy, for sheezy
My block - I'd never leave my block, my niggas need me

On my block, everybody business ain't ya business
What's going on in this house is staying here, comprende?
On my block, ya had to have that understanding
Cause if ya told Ms. Mattie, she went and told Gladys
And once ya mama got it, it was all on the wire
And when the word got back, they set yo' ass on fire
On my block, we got some 'Nam vets shell-shocked
Who never quite got right, now they inhale rocks
On my block--it's like the world don't exist
We stay confined to this small little section we living in
Oh my block, I wouldn't trade it for the world
Cause I love these ghetto boys and girls
Born and raised on my block

My block - where everything is everything for sheezy
My block - we probably done it all homey believe me
My block - we made the impossible look easy, for sheezy
My block - I'd never leave my block, my niggas need me
Now the funeral is over, and all the tears are dried up
Niggas hanging tape on the cut getting fired up
Looking for the nigga who pulled his pistol on my homie
An eye for an eye, so now your life is what you owe me
Look deep into the eyes of your motherfucking killer
I want you to witness your motherfucking murder, nigga
And since you wants to kill then your ass has gots to fry
But ain't no police, therefore your ass has gots to die
We play the game for keeps and if you slipped I guess you sleep
You sho' nuff fucked and now your ass is six feet deep
Cause where I come from yo, everybody's got a gat
And niggas try your ass just to see where you got your heart at
And if your shit is flimsy then your ass is gonna bend
And like I said before there'll be no tears in the end
I'm rolling through your hood and now my heart is filled with anger
You at your sister's house now your sister's life's in danger (by a total stranger)
With a gang of, niggas wanting to bang you
And hang you, stain you, with one up in the chamber
Let's take a trip up Holaway
So you can see how many niggas in my hood is down to die today
We standing up for our own shit
And if you outside the clique then you die, bitch
It ain't no love in this motherfucker
It ain't no love for yourself or your other brother, uh
Because we real with this shit so we stay true
And since we bang then we do what O.G. say do
I've got the mind of the man in the mirror so I'm looking at me vaguely
But I can't seem to fade me
I've got my pistol pawn cocked
Ready to lay shots nonstop until I see your monkey-ass drop
And let your homies know who done it
Cause when it comes to this gangsta shit you motherfuckers know who run it
So when you put this motherfucker to the test
You gotta realize something nigga
You fucking with the very best
I got this killa up inside of me
I can't talk to my mother so I talk to my diary
I'm going off on the deep end
I found myself face-to-face with myself while I'm sleeping
I see your picture in my head and my hands shake
You can run, you can hide but there's no escape
My inner feelings show no mercy on my enemy
I got to get this mutherfucker fore he gets to me
So in your own blood, you'll bathe
And I won't stop until I put this motherfucker in his fucking grave
And I can say this once again
You can cry but you'll still die
They'll be no tears in the end

"In world news today: officials agree that rapper Brad Jordan, alias
Scarface, must be stopped. After being monitored by Secret Service agents for two years, evidence leads Tobacco and Firearms officials to believe that his literally dope lyrics promote drug usage and distribution,degrade women, influence gambling, promote and teach violence. And more importantly it's influencing our minors and destroying our young community. Officials say, he's the lord of underground rap and his music must be stopped."

We got this whole motherfucker on a mission
Now the whole entire world's gotta try to come up with a quick decision
They claim we threats to society
And now they calling on the government to try and make somebody quiet
For the bullshit they done to me
Gangsta Nip, Spice-1 or 2Pac never gave a gun to me
So gangsta rap ain't done shit for that
I've even seen white folks from River Oaks go get the gat
So why you trying kick some dust up
America's been always known for blaming us niggas for they fuck-ups
And we were always considered evil
Now they trying to bust our only code of communicating with our people
Lets peep the game from a different angle
Matt Dillon pulled his pistol every time him and someone tangled
So why you criticize me
For the shit that you see on your tv
That rates worse than PG
Just bring your ass to where they got me
So you can feel the hand of the dead body
Chorus: Devin The Dude
Nigga don't believe that song
That nigga's wrong
Gangstas don't live that long
Nigga don't believe that song
That nigga's wrong
Gangstas don't live that long

So now they trying separation
And sending black folks in white coats to infiltrate our congregation
Tapping into our conversation
Saying the message that they give
Bring forth or premeditation
So David's got a silver mag
While listening to Brad, David gets pissed and kills his dad
David Duke's got a shotgun
So why you get upset cause I got one
A tisket a tasket
A nigga got his ass kicked
Shot in the face by a cop, close casket
An open and shut situation
Cop gets got, the wanna blame it on my occupation
If you don't dig me, than nigga you can sue me
Because the shit that I be saying ain't worse than no western movie
Don't blame me blame your man Gotti
So you can feel the hand of the dead body
Chorus: Devin The Dude
Nigga don't believe that song
That nigga's wrong
Gangstas don't live that long
Nigga don't believe that song
That nigga's wrong
Gangstas don't live that long

You best to free your mind
Before I free my nine
And stop fucking with Devoid of Pop
Or feel my hot rocks
Bang,bang, boom boom, ping ping I'm the black
White boys got a magazine and don't kow how to act
I'll attack and make you vomit
Down with Khalid Abdul Muhammad
Do he got a brother, I'm it now
I'm the illest
Wanna kill this house nigga Don Cornelius
Can you feel this?
You punk niggas make me sick
Sucking on the devil's dick
Scared of revolution
Need to start douching
Houston is the place
I caught a case
Them motherfuckers tried to put a scar on my face
But I bust two times to the gut
Do the Reverend Calvin Butts
Got a pair of nuts?
I started this gangsta shit in '86
Now you dissing me
For publicity
Isn't he a ho to the third degree
Who me
I'm a g who like to scrap-a-lot
Down with Rap-A-Lot
And I can't stop, won't stop
So fuck Bill and Hillary
Ice Cube there ain't no killing me
Ice Cube, Scarface
Dropping on these selling out niggas, doing it like this
Chorus: Devin The Dude
Nigga don't believe that song
That nigga's wrong
Gangstas don't live that long
Nigga don't believe that song
That nigga's wrong
Gangstas don't live that long
{Verse 1: Scarface}
Man, I met this chick so fine
So bad she made me sick some time
I just had to fuck this bitch one time
I met her in The Galleria shopping
Buying gifts for some guy that she dating, still jocking
Second anniversary and I'm congratulating that
But man she had an ass so fat
You couldn't palm it with Shaquille hands
It seems to me she had the whole world in her pants
Walked behind her whispering love songs, she started smiling
So I handed her this bathing suit, and told her "Try it"
Replied, "Why?" with light brown eyes
"I'm shopping for a lady friend about your size"
She put it on so I paid for it, and then I told her she could keep it
Then I walked out the store, it's our secret
But peep it: made it down the hall, she came running
Bags about to bust, blouse wrinkled, but still stunning
I've done it, made mack move with girl chasing me
And shortly thereafter, exchanged our fuck faces
It's tasteless, but honey must've missed being treated
Like something more than niggas just humping and dudes beating
Her ass behind the silly shit
And I can see it in her eyes, she was sick of this
Let's see the sights, it's me tonight
Let's leave him stuck home pacing
Blowing up your pager, exchanging fuck faces

You must be used to all the finer things
Infatuated by what money brings
It seems to me you hoes will never change
So all that's left is for us to exchange
{Verse 2: Too $hort}
I called her up on the phone, said "I'll be there in a minute"
'Cause all them faces she be making when I'm in it
They make a nigga feel like he doing something
The pussy so good have you through with money
But you ain't knowing she's a tramp and a slut and all that shit
Every chance you get, you trying to call that bitch
Quite a few niggas got the pussy
But everytime I see her got to stop and look
'Cause she so damn fine, bitch
I want to make you mine, bitch
I want to fuck one time, bitch
Short Dogg's on your mind, bitch
I give a fuck about any nigga you fuck with, stuck with
I love the way she suck dick, and make me bust this
It's hard to hold back when it's this good
You said she wouldn't, I knew the bitch would
'Cause I'm a veteran, twist them in the game so fast
With this pimping, bitch, you know you ain't gon' last
I got to get 'em, let 'em know I'm pimping really
Unless I'm getting paid, the shit is temporary
Exchanging fuck faces, making hella noise
Getting freaky as fuck and go and tell my boys
'Cause It's like that
That's how we do this shit, bitch

You must be used to all the finer things
Infatuated by what money brings
It seems to me you hoes will never change
So all that's left is for us to exchange
{Verse 3: Devin the Dude}
Let me holla at 'cha, B; Short, check this
Just got through fucking this bitch
Who swallowed my cum and drunk my piss
I stuck my fist up in her cock, she didn't budge or move it
Sucking and fucking, mayne, she loved to do it
I bust 4, 5, 6, nuts in her mouth, when she come to my house
I know that's my bitch, and she don't tell nobody shit
She keeps it cool, she said that pussy's mine
And because the way I rhyme, she let me fuck her all the time
I'm thinking about keeping this bitch by my side
Girl so fine niggas, dreamed they fucked her and lied
But I'm numero uno, the one and only
Bitch be all on me, chewing my nuts like bologna
Then click, she licked on my dick like plop
Then nut skeeted out like thick white snot
She saw it was still hard and said "Look what I got"
Then rubbed it, hugged, it and shoved it in her cock
Tried to tell her to stop, but the bitch wouldn't listen
I guess a dick that's hard and rock is what these hoes be missing
And in return, she used a stolen credit card to by me cases
And later on she get this bone and gives me fuck faces

You must be used to all the finer things
Infatuated by what money brings
It seems to me you hoes will never change
So all that's left is for us to exchange
{Verse 4: Tela}
I got a call from Laquesha and some of her nieces
Saying it's about six or seven dime pieces
We can hook up with no chains and no leashes
Tied to this fucking affair and slow leases
See what we gon' do is fall through with crushed ice
Man, these hoes been talking 'bout fucking for three Nights
Whole damn grill so slick, it's kind of nice
Not too expensive, but comfortable and it's quiet
The Remy that she give me, and feel me, it's tranquilized
Thinking to myself at this time and realized
She ain't got on panties, so damn me, it's in the signs
Somebody's getting fucked tonight to my surprise
Enter the room with the cat-ass eyes
Rochelle who do nails with them thick ass thighs
See, I love these kind 'cause they ain't with that bullshit
Get a nigga off in the room and pull shit
Girl, stop licking right there, you killing me
Go ahead and touch it right there and feel the P
This some cold blooded shit with a bitch you let me sit through
Damn hoe, I must admit, that's why I dig you
So I put you to the world of forgotten fuck faces
You getting buck places, drinking, love, and sex chases
You know what I'm saying, baby? It's either now or never
Too $hort, Tela, Devin, Scarface in style

You must be used to all the finer things
Infatuated by what money brings
It seems to me you hoes will never change
So all that's left is for us to exchange
You must be used to all the finer things...
Circumstances are like my first fight I lost
It was swinging, my arms bugging, adrenaline pumping
Oh shit, this little nigga's thugging
I mean, I was thirteen, I was nursing a knot on my face
But chose another time and a place
That I would avenge my last fight cuz the same shit
Ain't gonna happen that just happened last night
Knuckle game changed quicker than lightning
Hit 'em or slice 'em
Either stick 'em or blast pipes, it's the fastlife
I try to give another nigga advice, shoot dice
Do plenty of shit cause this life, how many you get?
How many niggas do you know get two?
Besides a nigga who snitch to skip a life-bid, be one a' your crew
I don't respect killers, I respect O.G. knowledge
Codes of the streets got new rules, but no guidance
Lessons, detrimental to a young disciple
Focus, take care of your brothers, niggas do as I do
Keep your enemies close, where they can see you
It's not your enemy who get you
It's always your own people (x5)

Mass confusion, in my head
Killing me, driving me mad
Got me wondering, can I trust my friends?
Cuz they stick me in my back every chance they get
Am I paranoid? and if that's the case
Is it curable? Can you help me find my place?
I can't handle this, I'm losing it
With a loose grip I'm hanging on to emptiness
Help your brother, save him from the
Evil demons in between us, came between us

I know you hate me, don't you
I bet you sit and wish my time never came
You probably rather see me die in the game
You probably rather see me die in a plane
Well ya'll see me up on top of my dough
I get my money shit changed
And niggas start looking at me different than this
And downplay the real nigga shit to get with a bitch
But I'mma tell a motherfucker like this
You only good as what you come up against
Nigga you get what you get
Sure the grass is greener on the other side of the fence
But any attempts and you gonna need the guy in the trench
I'ma starter while you riding the bench
You saying you a player, well I'm the one designing your prints
Something to go by, to let these niggas know I
Don't believe in letting shit slide, nigga gonna die
Best friends since high school seniors
With a homeboys demeanor
But let the bullshit come between us

Mass confusion, in my head
Killing me, driving me mad
Got me wondering, can I trust my friends?
Cuz they stick me in my back every chance they get
Am I paranoid? and if that's the case
Is it curable? Can you help me find my place?
I can't handle this, I'm losing it
With a loose grip I'm hanging on to emptiness
Help your brother, save him from the
Evil demons in between us, came between us

Ay this um...
This song right here dedicated to the homie Curtis Davis
We love you home, Big Mello, RIP
Facemob for life
If I had to play God for a day
I would open up the gates, let the world see my face
Remove all doubt from the ones without the faith
And put them on the path of the straight
A safe place, for the young to come out if they want to play
I let their mommas know that they ok
And when y'all pray, I'll respond so you can all see a sign
And answer every pray one at a time
If I'm God huh, all the stabbings all the war would come to cease
My whole entire hood would be at peace, no more beef
And you could sleep without the fears of being woke
By the sounds of sirens, screams of people being smoked
No more dope you don't need it, you'll be cured of all diseases
Your whole entire life would be deleted
Please forgive me I've been dreaming
And rudely interrupted by the demons
Laughed at the picture I was seeing on the ceiling

Who listens when we pray
Who pulls the strings of the world as we struggle today
Will you show your face
I don't want to wait wait, wait 'til I die
Wait wait, wait for my eyes to close
Smile on your child so he knows
God has a face

Just imagine if the devil had a day
And God had took a break and walked away, would you feel safe?
If everything you loved turned into hate
Will the dark angel's evil show you grace
Only to be eaten by a snake, one life one mistake
Be careful of the choices that you make, cause one day
You'll be standing on your feet and then the next
You're underneath the sheet greeting death
I wonder when I sleep is he there sitting on my chest
Stealing breath, shortening my days even less
Lost souls never rest, a killer walks the streets seeking flesh
A adolescent hangs she's depressed
A priest who confessed, a judged typing a nigga in a text
Your honor, what the fuck did you expect?
A father kills his son look at life it's a mess
Just imagine what would happen if the lord up and left

Who listens when we pray
Who pulls the strings of the world as we struggle today
Will you show your face
I don't want to wait wait, wait 'til I die
Wait wait, wait for my eyes to close
Smile on your child so he knows
God has face

When all that you believed in was a lie
Are you willing to accept it when you find out
Or try to reason with yourself that's what it is when it's not
And all the whole while it's been a plot
To poison our minds and leave us blind to the fact
That they keep us in the dark know they act
We react all surprised and not realize that this shit a trap
Thought religion was the answer but the answer wasn't that
The church and these politics they all full of crap
It's a shame but that's how were blaming it's for the scratch
So I don't knock I'm tryna to put a black card in my wallet
But some dollars in my pocket ain't the topic
Y'all need to stop it
This is just crazy these little babies ticking time bombs
Walking around the lunchroom pulling guns
If momma and daddy took the time to raise their son
Then the sister wouldn't be the mom before she twenty-one huh

Who listens when we pray
Who pulls the strings of the world as we struggle today
Will you show your face
I don't want to wait wait, wait 'til I die
Wait wait, wait for my eyes to close
Smile on your child so he knows
God has face
Dope sold on the cut make our hands bleed
Fuck broke it ain't an option, penitentiary
Or the grave is the only way we fall back
Do our time A.T.W then crawl back
To them streets where we come from taught life
Look alive know niggas better walk right
Real with it quick trigger finger gun play
I only know how to deal with these niggas one way
And someday I swear to God I'mma change that
But I can't cause them evil demons came back
And when I'm high y'all I can't explain
What it feels like wishing I could die and just end the pain
Cause mane I've been a loyal dude and you can trust that
But loyalty versus greed equals fuck that
I need to talk but there ain't no one to listen
Lost inside a mental exorcism
And wishing

Sometimes I close my eyes trying to hide from the pain
Things in my past are catching up fast living life against the grain
Just one time I wanna clear my mind the silence seems so loud
If I could I would fly away and live my life beyond the grey cloud

I woke up from a dream feeling all good
Prayed for better days ahead but what was yall doing
Lost, stuck in a stand still waiting for a hand out
Hustling for tennis shoe paper never panned out
My sister tripping got my grandmother stressing
Cause shes only 17 and shes already pregnant
Another segment of them ghetto soap operas
Bg's is tripping ain't nothing left to stop them
Uncle in jail daddy dead and their mamma's
Can't teach them how to be men; grow up being followers
The streets swallow them then life overpower them
Then off to the pen where the old heads devour them
Crash tested a dummy high volume
Only God can judge but y'all niggas is comical
90 percent of our future's off in prison
Prescription for my mental exorcism
And listen

Sometimes I close my eyes trying to hide from the pain
Things in my past are catching up fast living life against the grain
Just one time I wanna clear my mind the silence seems so loud
If I could I would fly away and live my life beyond the grey cloud

Another kid killed in cold blood a mothers heart broke
Family crying on the first few my heart spoke
Hurtful words I would never dare speak
In the house of the lord still I'm in the devils reach
I don't wanna hear the preacher preach that shit a lie
Plus he knowing how that evil be, but who am I
To judge a man when I see him try
FOX news tried to justify him
And ain't no way that you can clarify
In cold blood our lil homies dying
Another sign of the times but it's terrifying
That you could kill us off have us outlined in chalk
Get arrested go to jail go to court and get the fuck off
That shit is fucked off we worried about the money lost
While the clans about to light another cross
I ain't denying it I speak from intuition
It's also from my mental exorcism
And wisdom

Sometimes I close my eyes trying to hide from the pain
Things in my past are catching up fast living life against the grain
Just one time I wanna clear my mind the silence seems so loud
If I could I would fly away and live my life beyond the grey cloud
Yeah
What do you mean, "Where am I at?"
Tss, I'ma call you back

No you can't be my girlfriend
'Cause I don't need that stress up in my life and
No you can't be my girlfriend

I think if Adam would of had another squeeze he might
Not have ate those fruits from the leaves of life
Far as Eve, there couldn't have been a more deceivin' wife
Seen that Adam had a weak spot and she was right
I just call it how I see it, she in love with him
And he in love too, but still fuckin' all of them
Can you imagine you on lock with one breeze for life?
Wakin' up in the mornin' and layin' down at night
With the same face lookin' at you all the time
Realizin' now that happiness was hard to find
You wanna go out and try to find that smile and face
Plus she's always mad and her sex ain't great
And she don't suck dick like she used to do
Force a nigga into tryna find him somethin' new
And on the real, I done seen it when it went like this
But girl, there's one thing happenin' that you can't forget

No you can't be my girlfriend
'Cause I don't need that stress up in my world and
No you can't be my girlfriend
And we can get it on and on and on
I'm gone when the sun come again
Can't be my girlfriend
You can't be my, you can't be my

But you can never be my main boo, we can remain cool
But we can't be seen and for this I can blame you
Because you got more miles than a F-350
You been ran through and I know for a fact you got history
But since we met, I've been hearin' your name in certain circles
Pussy got a snap like a turtle
And you can catch a nigga on the late night
Comin' out the club, half drunk off Remy and Sprite
And make a man out of him quick 'cause of how you handle the dick
It's unlike no other, she a bad motherfucker
But I'm too strong to let a hoe undercover
Make me look fucked up 'cause unlike those others
I done met a lot of freaky girls in my lifespan
So you can't get mad 'cause I am not your man
Your understandin' was bad, it was not my plan
For you to fall in love with me, girl it's not like that

No you can't be my girlfriend
'Cause I don't need that stress up in my world and
No you can't be my girlfriend
And we can get it on and on and on
I'm gone when the sun come again
Can't be my girlfriend
You can't be my, you can't be my

For me to say that, "I do," would be a lie 'cause I don't
Believe no woman is right for me so I won't
Try to talk myself into thinkin' she is
And if she leaves me for this, that's just one less bitch
And trust me, I tried to be a one woman man
But for every one woman, there's a man, home man
Sayin', "Damn, I done spent six years in this shit
The first two was cool and then the bitch just flipped"
And then that's it, had to make some new plans
'Cause your brand new woman got a brand new man
Now you're hurt all alone, steady hittin' her phone
But a bigger whip and longer bankroll, she gone
And if I ever say, "Maybe," and you thought that I might
You consider, just imagine what my wife was like
And if you ain't love my kids like you loved your own
And me unconditionally when I was wrong, I was gone

No you can't be my girlfriend
'Cause I don't need that stress up in my world and
No you can't be my girlfriend
And we can get it on and on and on
I'm gone when the sun come again
Can't be my girlfriend
You can't be my, you can't be my girl

Sorry baby
Cos I ain't ever change on you motherfuckers
And OG's spitting game on you motherfuckers
You should be ashamed like a motherfucker
The streets packed with all these lame lil motherfuckers
Everybody wanna be a hard stopper
You won't find too many riding out without a chopper
They end up dead or somewhere in lock up
Where somebody will break em off something proper

These youngsters think that I'm so cool
They wanna learn the game from an old school
I give em strategies to sleep on
So when they put me in the grave they could keep on
Now first on your check list
Be your own man cos your friends ain't shit
They only come around when they need to
Use that home boy shit to deceive you
Remember you don't owe nobody, niggas
Niggas put the bite to the hand that feeds, that’s your body
And they forgetting how they got there
This is life, it's a game, but it's not fair
It's hard enough trynna get by
Day to day struggling with shit so you get high
And staying drunk on the regular
Talking dope talk on your cellular
But in this game that's a no-no
The streets ain't the only ones watching, taking photos
And life ain't bitches and money
This life's bout getting this money
Because that bitch is a problem
Can't live with and can't live without her
My advice to you is stay on your grind
Keep that bitch on her back and your bank on your mind, nigga


And we don't talk to police
That's the number one rule on the streets
Cause if you can't do the time, then you don't do the crime
Nigga keep the streets quiet
You don't upstrap unless you have to
Bullshit with these niggas and they clap you
You gon' revenge somebody?
Dig two graves, just in case it's two bodies
And never bring a stick to a gunfight
One shot, one kill, you get one life
And shitting where you sleep ain't an option
People knowing where you sleep, that's a problem
You got to watch these niggas
They ain't your home boys, not these niggas
First chance you call sleep, they could murk you
So don't put squares in your circle
Cos these streets don't love nobody
You gotta pay attention to the signs, Johnny
If you a weak nigga, don't try to play hard
Better keep your punk ass out the yard


And don't get fronted, just avoid that
But if you have to, pay them boys back
Cos niggas ain't playing, it's a drought
The border is closed, the cash running out
And broke mother fuckers make the best crooks
Every nigga in the way getting shook
You got to play the game by the book
I fuck around and your life getting took
And last but not least, when you make that money
Keep it low-pro, don't say shit, dummy
And don't say shit to your girlfriend
Pillow talk will send your ass to the state pen
Take notes to the game I'm providing
Stop using momma names trynna hide shit
Nigga them feds ain't stupid
You ain't the only nigga trynna do this
Riding round the hood in a four-door
Flying spur ol' rims, trynna showboat
You drawing too much attention
And then be surprised when you catch a life sentence
The game is a thing that you boys should be proud of
But once you in it, it's hard to get out of
And greed will kill a nigga like a gun do
So when you get the chance to make a break for it, run fool
Staring down the barrel of a Colt .45
I'm feeling mad suicidal, so I think I'm gonna drive
Everything is hazy and I can't see my lanes
Demons got me seeing double in the rain
If I put the pedal to the metal, take my hands off the wheel
Lord if you hear me, steer, steer
Lord if you hear me, steer

I think I need to breathe cuz I ain't feeling right
My conscience is at ease saying live your life
Got everything I ain't missin' much, bruh
Got my little paper back I ain't feeling fucked up
My woman got my back so I ain't stressed out
Side looking in, you can say I’m blessed huh
Career still intact got my street cred
Went on with life thinking that the beef’s dead
But every now and then I get flash backs
Get down on my knees and I ask that
God keep my head on cuz I dont wanna spaz out
Load back up that 45 and air a nigga, ass out

Staring down the barrel of a Colt .45
I'm feeling mad suicidal, so I think I'm gonna drive
Everything is hazy and I can't see my lanes
Demons got me seeing double in the rain
If I put the pedal to the metal, take my hands of the wheel
Lord if you hear me, steer, steer
Lord if you hear me, steer

Awaken by the sound of the siren
Helicopter spotlights illuminate the crime scene
Crowd gathers round try to find out what the fuck just happened
Wait a minute, time out
I looked a little closer at my t-shirt
I see squirts of blood just now starting to bleed worse
I'm lost I got blood on my hands, though
And then the camera man starts to pan slow
Realizing what I'm up against
I guess I just have to face the consequence
Snap back to reality
I gotta think fast, got some motherfuckers after me


Paranoid, got me running for my life now
Homicide, questioning my mama and my wife now
Parking lot, full of cops, got the dogs out
Running, chest burning, out of breath
About to fall out
Hit the corner, parked car at the stop sign
Going back to jail ain't the plan so the outline
Is to come up with something so I escape this or hand cuffs
Fuck that I ain't gonna take shit
I rather be carried by 6 than judged by 12 getting that cell
Or maybe they gon' gun a nigga down
Cause they don't wanna see me in the trial

Everything is hazy and I can't see my lanes
Demons got me seeing double in the rain
If I put the pedal to the metal, take my hands of the wheel
Lord if you hear me, steer, steer
Lord if you hear me, steer
Ghetto niggas remain violent while the killers remain silent
Niggas strapped with 45's and ain't smiling
And I'm driving to a place they're all warrin'
The lake we build houses but it's the hood we call home
In the ghetto the only place a motherfucker will keep it real
We focused on the dollar bill, still
The outsiders tend to disrespect the place
Where niggas do they struggling die with a straight face
Surviving, under conditions demons died in
You can run it but can't hide it so step aside
It's the nigga that makes music for the streets
Cause I love this motherfucker like pussy with no sheets
Cause it's deep
Some niggas make it out the neighborhood and won't surface
And let the money make them nervous, what's the purpose?
A motherfucker sitting on fat
Who done came up in the hood but he can't come back
Fuck that, I remain in the street game frame
On a mission to maintain me and take aim
In position to let my opposition know my life
Cause off in these streets I keep it real but what's right?
Surviving, sitting on a key doing business on a beeper
I'm sinking in this motherfucker deeper
Fear the reaper that no man born or woman harm me
Fuck being a nigga in your army; though I'm a killer
Enter the ghetto so that you can see
What I mean when I say I love this cause it loves me
Let it be, stop looking at this motherfucker strange
And talking 'bout a motherfucking change
This is for my thug niggas

This one for the homies and the thug niggas (uuuuugh)
This one for the homies and the thug niggas (uuuuugh)
This one for the homies and the thug niggas (uuuuugh)
This one for the homies and the thug niggas (uuuuugh)
This one for the homies and the thug niggas (uuuuugh)
This one for the homies and the thug niggas

'Face, imagine us working at McDonald's
To me and you, selling fucking, tapes to the Bahamas
Gold slug, a car full of thug niggas
Twenty inch wheels candy paint so we drug dealers
No Limit soldiers to the fullest
See I was raised on red beans the size of some bullets, huh
We ghetto niggas can't be stopped
Got me mixing up dope with little J down at Rap-A-Lot
My phone tapped the feds on my tail
Got me paying luxury taxes on everything I build
True to the ghetto that's my life
You see that house on the lake it's for the kids and the wife
You can test me if you wanna
Cause I be dumping niggas off from New Orleans to California
Rowdy like a hurricane (uuuuuugh)
Independent, black owned got 'em hooked on this cocaine
You used to see CEO’s in suits and ties
But we young niggas in tennis shoes and diamonds
Executive street millionaires
Niggas gonna be 'bout it 'bout 'til we gray in the wheel chair

This one for the homies and the thug niggas (uuuuugh)
This one for the homies and the thug niggas (uuuuugh)
This one for the homies and the thug niggas (uuuuugh)
This one for the homies and the thug niggas (uuuuugh)
This one for the homies and the thug niggas (uuuuugh)
This one for the homies and the thug niggas

What do you get from boosting?
Niggas coming out to California, and represent them niggas from
Houston
And now 2Pac ll keep this shit popping
And all my niggas across the Bay, know L.A., keep the shit hot
I keep a Glock inside my pants , don't give Locaz a chance
Put me inside a casket, you dirty bastards
Until the day I die, you catch a nigga high off weed, the police can't
Find me
My shit will drop and I'll sell five million
While all the niggas enter the game, they caught up in drug dealing
Now how can I fall? how can I ball, how can I catch my enemies and murder 'em all?
My words of flame, burn niggas inside their brain
Niggas can't hang with me, and nuttin's changes, uh
Scarface got me on this shit
We lace heat, motherfuckers in they body and face, uh
Growing thicker, liquor, maybe ya daddy a nigga
Niggas don't wanna see me worldwide, mob figure
M.O.B., Hennessy keep me g'd and
Keyed niggas, don’t wanna see me, when I got weed, in my system
Catch another victim, capture bodies
Bring a shottie to the fucking party, yeah
I party all night
I do this shit cause it's wrong but we born right
And to these niggas in my zone, we do it long ways
'til these bitches understand nigga my song pays; cause I'm the man
Now these are my homeboys, we outlaws 'til the day we die
Keep this shit, rough and raw
My 45, make sho', that I survived, to another day
Just bust rhymes, and brothers get paid
Now that's the end of my freestyle, but it was laced with game
Buy my shit and you can hear it plain, West Side!

This one for the homies and the thug niggas (uuuuugh)
This one for the homies and the thug niggas (uuuuugh)
This one for the homies and the thug niggas (uuuuugh)
This one for the homies and the thug niggas (uuuuugh)
This one for the homies and the thug niggas (uuuuugh)
This one for the homies and the thug niggas
I am ghetto, boy, chillin'
Represent for the niggas in the hood and how they livin'
Heavy metal concealin'
Hustlin' 'til you touch a 9 to 5 of drug dealin'
It don't matter how I get it, I got it, fuck feelings
I don't have none, I'm 'bout my paper, nigga, ask 'em
Don't get confused on how the cash come
Never, by any means necessary better
Get up off your ass and get my money 'fore I stretch yah
Out in front your doorstep, when I brandish this .45th
You can make arrangements, you a dead man, a ghost
See I come from them cuts for real
Much long before this rap came, fuck the deal
I survived the game of life, nigga, fuck some skills
Crossin' me, get in the way, this pussy must get killed
I'm alive, he came, he bust 'til he left
I would have made for sure I was dead and fuck yourself
Yeah, cause now I'm at his ass with a vengeance
Blood in, blood out from the beginning to the ending
Real shit bein' spit, know your limits
It's best you mind your mothafuckin' business
If you ain't in it

So hard in these streets
Gotta pack a pistol plus talk to God in these streets
Go to church, Sunday, Monday, sellin' raw in these streets
Never took it home though, I left it all in these streets
Gotta do what I gotta do
I ain't promotin', no, eviction notice on the door
Fuck it, I had to go for broke
Do what I gotta do
Hustle 'til I see the dirt
Riskin' 25 years just to see another first

I was all alone, car full of niggas
How'd I get here? Car full of hittas
I was rollin' weed, they was snortin' blow
Such a cool breeze, heart so cold
Step up to the plate, where your money at?
Bobby Brown on cake with a hundred packs
New editions, Lisa Lisa
We were secret lovers, had to get a beeper
My Atlantic star, not a Notre Dame
Not a student loan, tried to motivate
Continental, my Bentley, this shit should be illegal
Selassie eye in the ghost, thousand bales of that diesel
Lord, go toe to toe with any pussy boy
Fuck, one time for Face and all the Boobie boys
26 inch plates on a 68
Where I'm from a half a key'll set a nigga straight
I just wanna make the car notes
Let mama make the pot roast
You should meet me at the car wash
Washin' all 8, that's inshallah

So hard in these streets
Gotta pack a pistol plus talk to God in these streets
Go to church, Sunday, Monday, sellin' raw in these streets
Never took it home though, I left it all in these streets
Gotta do what I gotta do
I ain't promotin' no eviction notice on the door
Fuck it, I had to go for broke
Do what I gotta do
Hustle 'til I see the dirt
Riskin' 25 years just to see another verse

Speakin' for those squeakin' in them cell blocks readin'
To blacks, whites and Puerto Ricans
Brothers with those ankle bracelets, impatient for their releasin'
To make it back to the block, the hatred, the present
Time sure flies, look how many years went by
My young niggas already need hair dye
Alcoholic faces, women bad as a mug
Gettin' fat as fuck
Fried food be addin' up, the system thrives off its victims
They ask how this economic collapse
Can affect people all over the map
Tea party for tax reenactment is whack
The past the past, yo, to my vatos out in the East Los
Nietas on the east coast, shouts to Puerto Rico
Dominican Republic people, rep I
Brown and black, we must get it together
The prison industrial complex a fuckin' set up
The Aztec, Olmec, African settled on this land from the get up
I changed my aim, who I'm gon' wet up
When violence is resorted, knowledge is distorted
Unless it's payback for brutality
I'm more or less with that, get back

So hard in these streets
Gotta pack a pistol plus talk to God in these streets
Go to church, Sunday, Monday, sellin' raw in these streets
Never took it home though, I left it all in these streets
Gotta do what I gotta do
I ain't promotin' no eviction notice on the door
Fuck it, I had to go for broke
Do what I gotta do
Hustle 'til I see the dirt
Riskin' 25 years just to see another verse
Mr. Mr. Scarface been walking down the block
Out jumps some fiends and steals all his rocks
Pulls out a gun and shoots down all the fiends
And Mr. Mr. Scarface went up the block again

All I have in this world, all I have in this world
All I have, all I have, all I have in this world

Ahh yeah, hah
Mr. Scarface is back in the motherfuckin house once again!
Yea, droppin some of that new
Mr. Scarface Two, on your motherfuckin ass
So suck a nigga dick, or make a nigga rich
Or something, bitch

I don't give a fuck about the chatter in the background
Niggas get beat when they step this is Ak's town
If you don't know, I recommend you check
And ask them motherfuckers how many heads I put to rest
I play a game but the game ain't roulette
Slangin 'caine is the thang and I bet
That there's a lot of wannabe Scarfaces
I've heard the name in ninety-nine different places
I'm here to squash it all original will speak
Scarface on your ass from the streets
I left my cut, in fear of a prison term
They wanna put me in a chair and let me burn
But go to prison on a murder rap, fuck that
I refuse to be a visitor in state's camp
So I broke and left behind all I worked for
Either that or be sentenced for a drug war
And many want to know why I've slowed up
It's either that or get fucked
Cause laws get happy on the trigger
Say fuck it put a cap in a nigga
But this ass ain't made for no caps, homie
This ass says 'Exit Only'
So I get in the wind but hey
A nigga still sold a quarter everyday
I sat around for six months black
Waitin for the day to make a comeback
And now I'm ready for combat
Mr. Scarface is back

All I have in this world—all I have in this world
All I have in—all I have in—all I have in this world
Nobody knows my name, they'll only know this face
On the for-reala my nigga just call me Scarface
All I have in this world—all I have in this world
All I have in—all I have in—all I have in this world
Nobody knows my name, they'll only know this face
On the for-reala my nigga just call me Scarface
All I have in this world—all I have in this world
All I have in—all I have in—all I have in this world

Aiyo Bido, drop that shit
Yeah, heh heh
Back in the South Park, six o'clock on the dot
Checkin on my old rock spot
I seen the same old set
Heh, the small timers see me so they jet
Buildin' 128
I got myself a bag and I can't wait
To cut em up small to make a profit
Niggas on the cut short stop it
Fiends'll see em small then they go
Where, to see the motherfuckin' pro
One nigga got pissed
And started reachin' for his shit
.357 on your ass, fool
Like I said before, you don't get a second chance dude
Unloaded on his ass, he was hurt
Six shots put his dick in the dirt
Laid him out like a motherfuckin' rug
Gettin' pumped full of .38 slugs
Some other niggas stepped out y'all
Aw shit, I had to make a phone call

J. Prince: Hello?
Scarface: Hey J!
J. Prince: Wassup?
Scarface: I'm in a little trouble man
J. Prince: Where you at?
Scarface: I'm out here in South Park Village
J. Prince: Stay right there, I'll be right on
Scarface: C'mon let's take these motherfuckers to war man

J called up some niggas from the 5th Ward
And came back with a motherfuckin hit squad
Motherfuckin Uzi machine
Big Chief packed an M-16
Will an AK with a banana clip
And little Bill had a god damn pistol grip
I hit a little laugh and got me a buzz
And that's about the time they got drugged
One more war took place
You can call me the shit starter, or call me Mr. Scarface

All I have in this world—all I have in this world
All I have in—all I have in—all I have in this world
Nobody knows my name, they'll only know this face
On the for-reala my nigga just call me Scarface
All I have in this world—all I have in this world
All I have in—all I have in—all I have in this world
Nobody knows my name, they'll only know this face
On the for-reala my nigga just call me Scarface
All I have in this world—all I have in this world
All I have in—all I have in—all I have in this world

Damn, check this shit out
Later on, all alone, you know what happened next
Another bitch came by to give me sex
It was kind of strange I was thrown off
The last bitch got her head blown off
But fuck I ain'tsta pass up no putty
She started strippin' at the door, oh goody
I got in that ass with the quickness
Fuckin her down with the diznick
I didn't have to pretend I loved her
All she wanted me to do was just fuck her
So I gave it up to the lady
And all she said was "Fuck me baby, fuck me baby"
I started stroking in an outrage
The whole while I was starin' at my twelve gauge
The bitch was makin noise I said I'm killin her
And all the while my dick was hard and he was still in her
I made a nut as she fell to the floor
I heard a knock on the front door
I grabbed the twelve gauge from the bed head
Who is it? (Fred) Who?
Who the fuck is Fred, I stood by the door
By that time someone jumped in the window
Now what the fuck was I do?
The bitch packed a twenty-two
Hit him in his head, there she laid him
The nigga standin' by the door I sprayed him
And headed for the back
I seen that same old brown Cadillac
It kinda fucked me up at first
Cause the nigga that drove that Caddy rode away in a hearse
I opened up fire on the ride G
Who I was shootin for was standin right behind me
I had a double barrel pointed at my ass
Could this be the end of Mr. Brad?
I don't know what happened to the slut
Well that's about the time the closet door it opened up
(On your ass trick!
I'll be damned if I go out like the last bitch!)
Heh, five-0's on my ass man
They know me by the face, but they don't know my last name
Now I'm back on the case
Yeah, just call me Mr. Scarface
(Scarface whispering):
I don't really remember feeling like this
Got this love formin' in my life-for this dame
And indeed took the form of life-and that's a shame
How a man can fall in love with dreams--not afraid
Not afraid to let you up and leave
Do your thang MaryJane mess with all my folks-got 'em high
For the days that they were lost and broke-shit got 'em by
Only right we stop and give her props
Plus she from the block of only finer crops
Do your thang MaryJane
Chorus:
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Happy just to hear your name
Do your than MaryJane
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
When the world starts to stress you out-what you do?
Put a cancer stick up in your mouth-or grab a brew
Sold in stores but the fact remains is-they the blame
And the government's been taxin' that (   )-- gettin' paid
If it's taxable it's cool to smoke--kill or not
And the alcohol is killin' folks- true or not
Other people try to make you bad--but I know you not
When my situation's lookin' sad I know I got
A true friend in my time of need-all I need
Your natural you come from seeds-I decree
Makes me happy when I'm feelin' pain
Once again makes me happy just to hear your name
Do your thang MaryJane
Chorus:
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Happy just to hear your name
MaryJane do your thang
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
When you sad depressed and feeling strange-who you blame
Need some company to keep you sane-call her name
MaryJane I love you MaryJane-do your thang
You're all I need to get me through this thang-true to game
You ain't never made me smash my thangs-scratch the brain
Anything you've always kept me tame-and its plain
For me to see that you my everything-MaryJane
MaryJane helps to ease the brain-when you hang
Through the seasons you ain't never change-stayed the same
Never seen what people seen in speed-you became
Naturally you everything we need-do the thang
Do your thang baby true indeed
Do your thang MaryJane
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Happy just to hear your name
MaryJane do your thang
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
One (Bring your boy a bottle of wine)
Two (Don't forget the papers this time)
Three (Go to Joe's and pick up a dime)
And fuck the baddest hoes that your ass can find
One (Bring your boy a bottle of wine)
Two (Don't forget the papers this time)
Three (Go to Joe's and pick up a dime)
Four of the finest hoes that your ass can find

Sittin' at the stoplight, looking at hoes
Peeping out this bitch in her black Girbauds
Windows rolled up tight, top was closed
Blowing Swisher Sweet smoke out my nose
Open up the door and asked the bitch, "What's up?"
Lookin' at me crazy, I'm like, "Bitch what's up?"
She asked about my woman, I said "My woman at home"
I asked about her nigga, she said her nigga was gone
I got my pencil and got the digits and things
And after three or four days, I gave that bitch a ring
We started talking and I dropped some shit
Gave her some game and now I got that bitch
Now she wants to give your homie some ass
But it's just one question I got to ask
Can you...

One (Bring your boy a bottle of wine)
Two (Don't forget the papers this time)
Three (Go to Joe's and pick up a dime)
And four of the finest bitches that your ass can find
Can you, one (Bring your boy a bottle of wine)
Two (Don't forget the papers this time)
Three (Go to Joe's and pick up a dime)
And four of the finest bitches that your ass can find

I called my homie, told my homie "It's on"
Gotta few hoes that wanna moan and groan
They on they way I just hung up the phone
And we gon' be like Marvin Gaye, nigga, gettin' it on
But you gots to keep your head right
And make these bitches feel at home
'Cause these bitches got they head tight
And furthermore, they bringin' weed
Just kick back, nigga, follow my lead

One (Bring your boy a bottle of wine)
Two (Don't forget the papers this time)
Three (Go to Joe's and pick up a dime)
And four of the finest hoes that your ass can find
One (Bring your boy a bottle of wine)
Two (Don't forget the papers this time)
Three (Go to Joe's and pick up a dime)
And four of the finest bitches that your ass can find

Hung up the horn and the hoes arrived
Three tight young tenders, them hoes was live
Rolled herself a woola, told her "Fade me, troop"
Cock bustin' at the seams of her Daisy Dukes
Ass fatter than a motherfuckin' quarter horse
Ready to take one of these bitches to the slaughterhouse
Got my shirt over my dick 'cause it's hardened to fuck
Hoes eyes getting red, now they wantin' to fuck
It's about time to put the game in attack
Tapped her, told her bring "ol' what's her name" in the back
Got 'em in my room, about to hop in the tub
My homie walked in, "Show your partna some love"
Told my homie put it down, we finna act a fool
The ho said, "Cool, hop yo ass in the pool
I wanna polish up your tool"
But it's just one thing before you do
Can you...

One (Bring your boy a bottle of wine)
Two (Don't forget the papers this time)
Three (Go to Joe's and pick up a dime)
And four of the fattest Swishers that your ass can find
Can you, one (Bring your boy a bottle of wine)
Two (Don't forget the papers this time)
Three (Go to Joe's and pick up a dime)
And four of the fattest Swishers that your ass can find
Can you, one (Bring your boy a bottle of wine)
Two (Don't forget the papers this time)
Three (Go to Joe's and pick up a dime)
And four of the fattest Swishers that your ass can find
Can you, one (Bring your boy a bottle of wine)
Two (Don't forget the papers this time)
Three (Go to Joe's and pick up a dime)
Act a fool...uh!
...It's a new day... ya know what I'm sayin'?
A new day, brings a new problem to a brother
And all I gots ta say is thank god for my mother
Cause without my mommy dear my life would've been joke
Either locked up playin' dead and still slangin' dope but nope
The lord he had a plan for me
And with his help, my mother made a man of me
Didn't blindfold me to the world we was livin' in
Taught me how to save my little dividends
So when I graduated I'd have a little school money
But in the sixth grade I wanted to be the school dummy
And flunked outta school with the flag pole
And left my mother dear at home with a sad soul
Because my mother worked the fingers to the bone
Cause we was alone, and me I bought an F home
My real pops he broke out with the style
So I respect my stepdad, for raisin' another nigga's child
So now we livin' comftable
Taught me the game and how to be responsible
But back then I couldn't see it
I wanted to be a grown man at fourteen so the kid's leavin'
And ended up in a big fight
And told me not to come home until I got my shit right
So now I'm livin' in my grandma's home
My grandma's strong, she's got nine kids of her own
And keepin' me ain't no big deal
But now that I'm much older I see just how the shit feels
Being kind-hearted, not wantin' to tell me no
Even though my grandfather just had a stroke
And now the money's low
And pretty soon a brother's gonna have ta go
Or either try to find a job so I can help out
I'm in the ghetto, I gots ta get myself out
And when I get out I gotta try to pave the way
So my family can have a better place to stay
I'm losin' all hope, a brother's fallin' short
I can't cope, so now I'm slangin' dope
And now my granny knows I'm doin' wrong
She just prayin' for me heavily
Take care of her grandson
And the lord must of heard her prayer
Cause he made me get a grip
And got me on up outta there
I heard my mother say them streets is gonna kill ya
You couldn't have told me nothin' back then
But now I feel ya...
I'm eighteen, and now I'm havin' big fun
My baby's mother just had my first son
May eleven, I never will forget the day
A star's born, let's name him little Scarface
My first born and yo I'm a proud father
I gotta son, I gots ta be my son's father
And sellin dope ain't the way that I can get ahead
But what the hell, I gots ta keep my baby fed
I buy him milk, and pampers tryin ta do my part
And he's my son, I gots ta try to make him hard
I buy him clothes, and jewellry not the Tonka toys
Because the Tonka toys will only punk my boy
And I don't want my son to look at life
Through a replica of reality tryin' to make it life-like
But yet and still I let my son be a kid
Just give him up the real, exactly like my momma did
So when he gets to be a man he'll appreciate
The game I gave him way back when he used to roller skate
And now my son is four years old
I really gots ta give the real and try to play the father's role
Because these years he'll remember most
So it's all about little Marcus and me becomin' close
But I got a buncha obstacles
If it ain't my line of work it's the girlies on my popsicle
Now everybody's got my baby
Wantin' to have their hands in my pocket tryin to drive me crazy
"It's your daughter, don't she look like you?"
I just can't tell, why don't you take it to ma momma do
Because my mother knows the real deal
All these hoochies poppin' coochie tryin' to get a free meal
So now we in and outta cope
Tryin' to get mo money, braggin' om the child support
Tellin' her friends that she's breakin' me
Now eveybody knows, that she was just fakin' G
Come to find out, the girl never had me
She's the baby's mother but me I ain't the baby's daddy
And biological tests can prove
You gotta get up off of me and go after the other dude
But now I finally got a real daughter
No need for the testin'
I know that I'm the baby's father
I heard my daddy say them hoes will try ta kill ya
You couldn't have told me nothin' back then
But now I feel ya...
I feel ya...
Now I'm twenty-two and finally got a grip on life
It's nineteen ninety-three, I put away my pocket knife
And got a bigger stick to fight with
I'm young and black so my choice ain't a nightstick
Because we livin' in a concentration set
And everyday, we face to face with death
I seen my homies go and come
And judgement day is just somethin we can't run from
So I know my number's comin' up
So I gotta protect myself from suckers who be runnin' up
And even though I hate killin' off my own kind
I gotta be a man and as a man I'm a defend mine
My brother Quanell's tryin' to keep the neighbourhood at peace
Don't fight each other, we gots ta stand and fight the beast
So united we stand but we gonna fall quick
Because we always tryin to take another brother's shit
And the cops is in the same vote
Just because we comin' up quick they think we slang dope
They shootin' ta kill, they gas ain't sparkin' goods
They shot my long time partner Rudy in cold blood
And now the story's all twisted up
And if they gave the cop the chair
I really wouldn't give a fuck
Because she left my partner's family with memories
And after hearin' this I know you gon' remember me
But yet in still I find it hard for me to stay in touch
I see his parents and then I started breakin' up
Because I know what you did was wrong
But you won't realize until you dead and gone
It ain't no justifiable homicide, you never gave a warning
You straight up shot him from behind
But all the cryin' in the world ain't gonna bring him back
You give a gat to a black he don't know how to act
But you gotta tell your story to the judge
Not the imitation judge, the judge that everybody loves
And if the man upstairs grants you forgiveness
Then in reality you took care of your business
But regardless I know you wanna kill me
But I ain't goin' out like dat
Ya feel me?
...yeah

I sit alone in my four cornered room starin' at candles
Are we on the radio dukes?
Awww yeah, give it to me

Yeah, at night I can't sleep
I'm tossin' and turnin'
I still got the candlesticks burnin'
It ain't changed but it's a different time
And I'm still playin' tricks with my mind
My mothers always stressin' that I'm livin' wrong
But I got my Smith and Wesson cause I'm gettin' grown
And their lookin' at your little boys success
And I been thinkin', I'm dealin' with too much stress
So I stay up on my p's and q's
And watch out for the G's and fools
Cause the homies that I thought I had
See me stackin' up a grip
And they just started talkin' bad
So I stay away from outsiders
And when I roll through, it makes 'em open they mouth wider
I used to think that you was my one and only homie
My mind was playin' tricks on me

My mind was playin' tricks on me
My mind was playin' tricks on me

Yeah
Dear diary I'm havin' a little problem with my mind state
How many bullets would it take to change my mind? wait
Sometimes I want to end it but I don't though
They tell me see my pastor but I don't go
Cause they all be on this one street
So I take it on myself to thank him one deep
And give my money to the most needy
And never put it in the hands of the most greedy
Cause their puttin' a price tag on a man's word
And it's a fashion show, so the men flirt
The world is endin' so they try to make us switch fast
And they openin' up these churches for some quick cash
And usin' the money fo' they new cribs
While brother Johnson just got kicked out where he lived
I follow no man, cause man be phoney
My mind was playin' tricks on me
My mind was playin' tricks on me

Day by day it's more impossible to cope
I feel like I'm the one that's doin' dope
Can't seem to keep my mind on a steady track
I'm all about gettin' mine so I study that
But it seems they want to get me
So I try to keep my nine millimeter wit me
Just in case they want to see a homies head blown
But I got to stay around to see my kids grown
I finally found a woman who could deal wit me
Back then I had a woman who wouldn't real wit me
And now she's back with her old lady
And now I got it goin' on and they sure hate me
Now I'm a gone and she's alone
Hahahaha, her mind was playin' tricks on her
One time for your motherfuckin' mind
Bringin' it back like this here
1-9-9-1 all the way to the 1-9-9-4 and they call me 'Face
My mind was playin' tricks on me
You know they always say, man, it's tough being at the top, huh?
I couldn't agree with you more
Jealous hearted motherfucker
Never been able to fuck with me nigga, ever
Super solid from day one
Never put myself in a compromised position, I'm a chess player
And if I did... I'd just shoot my way out

First born to my momma
I come from the place where you're promised
To die before your 21st
You'll be surprised what's underneath the earth
Dug dirt, I put bones there
All my enemies is gone now
I can't sleep through the cold sweats
Flashbacks, I'm a known threat
God fearing yet I'm evil though
I think deep, I believe in ghosts
Ever felt the hand of a dead body?
Then you know why I took my gun and head-shot him
War started over dope cuts
I put what I live by on both nuts
It's either him or me so I say fuck dude
I look him in his eyes and say FUCK YOU!

Fuck you, hey, I been running this shit so long
My M.O. is like "fuck you!"
You niggas been throwing rocks at the throne
I'ma reach out and touch you
I ain't gotta put no money on your dome
My nigga, fuck you and everything you stand for
Hoe, bitch, pussy nigga, fuck you!

I live like I spit it
Raised by the wolves so my mentality is "get it"
A life on the streets takes commitment
The power that you gain gets addictive
The money being made gets you bitches
A real nigga played the game like it's business
A weak nigga facing time, go to snitching
Plotting on his whole team 'cause he ain't wanna listen
If it was all good just a week ago
Take your motherfucking charge, that's your key of dope
We all wanna eat, gotta feed folks
Took an oath on the streets called a G code
That's what we live by, die for it
I got homies standing firm doing time for it
We have five-K-one's, gun killers
 bust that nigga, fuck that nigga!

Fuck you, hey, I been running this shit so long
My M.O. is like "fuck you!"
You niggas been throwing rocks at the throne
I'ma reach out and touch you
I ain't gotta put no money on your dome
My nigga, fuck you and everything you stand for
Hoe, bitch, pussy nigga, fuck you!

They jealous of me cause I shine bright
Grind strong plus my mind right
My gun loaded up in both clips
Jump out on me wrong and meet the four fifth
No shit, this is music you can drive-by
G's the only code we abide by
Blunt burning in the ashtray
Playing faggot games and now your ass chafe
Niggas wearing tight pants and high heels
Claiming another nigga's hood that is not real
I am still the hardest nigga being heard
Fuck he claiming he real when he ain't keep his word?
He ain't fooling me, my nigga, he is just a nerd
Nothing but a rap tune, he ain't seen a bird, word
I talk that shit that I can back, though
Cause that's in my boxing game, I'm in the back, hoe
Talk that big six but pack a double blank
You where trouble ain't
Just another saint, fuck 'em!
If this is love I don't see it
Can't make me believe it
You a nice girl, but I'm a hood nigga on some street shit
And yeah, you know my weakness
Sucker for some love type
I come from the slums girl, you come from a good life
I wonder what you see in me
I love weed and Hennessy
You barely doing happy hour, I ain't never seen you drink
And now that's leaving me to think, how I got so close to you?
This was just a hit and split, that's what I supposed to do
One thing let up to the next, I'm addicted to your sex
You addicted to this dick, every cause has its effect
That's what I get I guess, I can't commit that's killing this
You gave me an ultimatum, I'm numb I ain't feeling shit
Must not know who she dealing with
Puddles on her pillow case, tears running, eyeline, lipstick smeared
Hey are you ok?
You disobey, you pay for that
Well, the love is gone, and she ain't made it back, pray for that

What happened to us, you acting foolish
I'm acting foolish, what we need to do is
Keep it movin', that's what we need to do
Before something happens we better keep it movin'
I'm 'bout to lose it, we're going through it
This shit confusin', what we need to do is
Keep it movin', that's what we need to do
Before something happens we better keep it movin'
(skit: Scarface/woman)
I'm just sayin', a relationship should be 100-100 not 50-50, right?
Right
Oh what you gon' think about that?
Yeah I'm gon' think about that
Look, you want me here or not?

Think before you answer that, it's hard enough we breaking up
But after this no turning back, brought this on myself with her
Mistakes I'm forced to live with that, I'm knowing more mistakes to come
I'm human, that's my best excuse, in fact my only one
Tears fall, my kids call, 'This ain't me, it's his fault'
Oh shit no, we did this
A partnership with no room for forgiveness
I take the blame, take your aim
Shoot that shot, can't wait to claim
All of this, in Jesus name
Pray in church, they give you change
I feel your pain
Songs sung in the key of life, with no meaning right
Hopefully one day might come I'd see the light
Can't sleep at night
And I'm wondering who's fooling who?
I'm sure you know who's fucking me, cause I know who's been fucking you
We used to be inseparable, never thought that that day would come
Where I'd take that shit so serious, and you get so good at playing dumb, you got away with one

What happened to us, you acting foolish
I'm acting foolish, what we need to do is
Keep it movin', that's what we need to do
Before something happens we better keep it movin'
I'm 'bout to lose it, we're going through it
This shit confusin', what we need to do is
Keep it movin', that's what we need to do
Before something happens we better keep it movin'

You had me I'll admit that, fell into the trap you set
Lookin' me in my eyes, lyin', killing me with that soaking wet
Wouldn't let me meet your connect
Scratching me all across my face
Says she loves the way it feels when I'm in it all the way
60 calls a day, wondering where the fuck I'm at
Wondering where the fuck I stay, who else I fuck like that
Now let's be honest, you got him with whom you made your promise
And let us not forget, it's her with whom I made my woman
I know our days are numbered, enjoying moments after
Plus in lust we fell in love, the pains are more than laughter
Living our separate lives, are husbands reckless why?
Beneath the questions lie, why was she left to cry?
Should have left shit quiet, but you was out of line
Better step aside, gotta tell me why?
I was everything, you was all I had
Now this is change, and then this change is bad
Make a note of that

What happened to us, you acting foolish
I'm acting foolish, what we need to do is
Keep it movin', that's what we need to do
Before something happens we better keep it movin'
I'm 'bout to lose it, we're going through it
This shit confusin', what we need to do is
Keep it movin', that's what we need to do
Before something happens we better keep it movin'
Greatest ever done it, you can learn from it
Dope game; ran it - rap game; run it
Street cred hundred, nerd turned D-boy
Naughty genetic make-up, baby, I'm a G-boy
Hashtag street-boy, wrong one to fuck with
Cross me at your own risk, play to get back, you can trust this
I am far from average, to me it ain't no such thing
Me against the world so fuck it I let my nuts hang
I've been known to bust bang, Kíli of the NEB
I don't need an army when the smoke clears, he sees me
Rhyming at its finest unlike those vaginas
They claim that they the real deal knowing I'm the highest
Time for the command chain, I am what the streets made
I am what the hood built, you are just a weakling
Homocidal maniac with suicidal tendencies
You're more like a punk band, I'm more like a pedigree
Nigga, you ain't seen yet so y'all can not describe me
I'm a freak of nature, Don't shit here suprise me
Money over everything except a nigga's manhood
I am not a prostitute, you don't understand hood
Fuck a nigga getting his unless he 'bout to give me mine
Otherwise he prime beef, shocking when I up the nine
And hit him with it several times, fuck you thought I was civilized?
Welcome to the jungle, fool, it's only right I punish you
Nigga with an attitude, feel like MC Ren felt
Quiet on the set, you funky bitch, you get your friend slept
I'll give your gang a black eye, blame it on the black God
I be on some nigga shit, I'm nigga rich so that's why
Guess what my religion is, this is what the business is
Expose you for your garbage ass rappers, you can witness this
Came to bang the game up, pussies think they came up
Oh, you got a drophead? So now you think you're famous?
Out here it's dangerous, if we don't know your name cuz
We don't even give a fuck, rappers get it fucked up
Security save you? Nah, it's their side job
They don't want no conflict, they don't want no problem
Nah
(riiinnnngggg) "Don't answer that"
"Hello, I'm not at home, leave a message (beep)
"Yo, bitch, this is (beep) pick up the phone, bitch
I know you're in there
You fucking with that old fucking ass 'Face now, huh bitch
Where my motherfucking kids at, bitch
Fucking bitch, punk ass bitch!"

Hey, today must be my lucky day
I turned the corner, hit the block and seen that ass from a mile away
(now where's she staying?) she must be new in the hood
But I ain't trippin' on that shit, cause it's all good
I rolled up on her, and I asked her her name
Ain't a damn thing changed, ain't no shame in my game
She said, " Used to go Thomas"
I slowed my roll, cause she just might be one of my homies' babies mamas
Now where your man at, she said "Gone at work"
Gave me the look, I cracked a smile and thinkin', "Go on and flirt"
My homies women ain't no thing to me
Cause if they caught one of my ho's, they'd do the same to me
And furthermore, she was peepin' my ride
Convertible, 64, with the ride inside
Super clean with the discs and vogues
Higher than a fuck spittin' this to hoes:

Please excuse my attitude, sorry if I'm being rude
But I've got something to say to you
Hoping you won't lose your cool
I wanna sneak you out to play with me
You can spend the day with me
And we can ride and see the sights
It's going down tonight

Reminiscing on the bitch that I had back in the day
Gave the bitch a call and she hung up in my face
Now that's the breaks
She didn't have to put up a front
I stuck that ass back in there
And haven't called her for 3 months
I guess it's in me to be doggin' a chic
Can't understand how you niggas just be hogging your bitch
Go on and pass her, unass her, send her to the master
Let her take a ride with the Bradster
It cool, don't front ..ooooh, no sex
No sweat-not even on my mind-we just met
And furthermore, we can get to those
But for now, I'm rolling 'Raris spitting this to hoes:

Please excuse my attitude, sorry if I'm being rude
But I've got something to say to you
Hoping you won't lose your cool
I wanna sneak you out to play with me
You can spend the day with me
And we can ride and see the sights
It's going down tonight

Now I'm cruisin' to the crib with this bitch that I scooped
Parked my Ferrari, now I'm back in the coup
I knocked her boots - your baby's mama put me to work
I tagged that ass from the back, and knocked her shit in the dirt
She wanted me badly so I put it inside
She got the (front, back, and side to side)
Back and forth with the gangster glide
Started off at 6 and didn't finish till 9
Hit the showers like I been out playing ball for the Knicks
Now she's asleep, cause she just had her drawers full of dick
(now that's sick) and plus she got you staying at home
With the kids all alone while she's gettin' her fuck on
So believe me when you downin' the Brad
I'm at the pad with your baby mama clowning that ass
So player hatin' niggas check the bitch you chose
I'll be mobbing in my 'Benz spitting this to ho's:

Please excuse my attitude, sorry if I'm being rude
But I've got something to say to you
Hoping you won't lose your cool
I wanna sneak you out to play with me
You can spend the day with me
And we can ride and see the sights
It's going down tonight
There's gonna be some shit you might not understand
But, you may have to rewind this shit a few times
Heaven, heaven
Check it out
I know tomorrow ain't a promise
That's why I live one day at a time
So when it's my turn, there'll be no crying
I'm aware that when my number's called I'm punching the clock
No need for screaming at me momma, I'm out
And plus I wasn't really happy here to start with, let that be told
My own homeboy was robbing me, and that's 3 cold
I said '3', It's all intentional, cause 2 don't count
When your own blood is bitter and your homeboys bounce
Who the fuck is you gonna trust when your road dog is scheming?
And every other corner, you're passing a different demon
And now the clouds is open, I'm remembering this
Your families your backbone, your friends ain't shit
Now I believe it when Rhonda was saying "Back in the days..."
When our homeboys left, she the only ones stayed
For that very reason, I'm a try and give her the world
Found heaven in the form of a girl, everybody's saying
(Chorus)
My angel
My sunshine
That's the day that I found heaven in the form of a girl
My best friend
My good time
That's the day that I found heaven in the form of a girl
Listen to different scriptures, they teach on God
And if you ain't never met him, don't speak on God
I'm serious about religion, this shit's ain't no song
I'm hearing niggas makin' up scriptures, and playing along
Probably saying I'm the hypocrite, for judging these folks
But you can tell he ain't a Christian, by the way that he spoke
I pray for everybody, hoping that they hear that voice
The one that paralyzes you from head down, boy
When you're aware of your surroundings, yet you still can't move
Water shooting outta your eyes you hear this dude
And the voice is much louder, than the voice that you
Thought was the voice of the holy spirit
Gon' change your life when you hear it
And the next morn', you wake up and the world look lighter
The grass greener, and the sun brighter
I know the feeling first hand, I witnessed the sights
When I allowed the Lord to come in my life
And it was like (heaven, heaven...)
But I'm a man, I ain't perfect
That's a poor excuse, that ain't working
I asked him for forgiveness, for every sin I commit
Hopefully he gonna let me stay on his list
And trying and get to heaven...
America the Beautiful, don't be so cold
How do you expecting our seeds gonna grow?
When you trap us in the ghetto
And show love, to the other motherfuckers
While we right here starvin' at home
I'd cry, if I thought, that me sheddin' a tear might help
Then again, me sheddin' tears don't help
Wanna call up to the President, and see if he know help
Let him know you up shit creek yourself, we all sinners
Facin' the winter, with no socks, and no shoes
In a position, where we all gon' loose
Instead of penitentiaries, we gon' need more schools
Or what the fuck is we gonna do?
Sit around and let the world pass us by?
Waitin' on a message from the reverend
And he ain't but another man, tryin' to get to (heaven...)

So now I'm forced to pop the clip in
S to the motherfucking A, nigga set tripping

I'm like Pac, I'm making mail but I still live the thug life
My rap name's getting bigger
But ain't nothing changed, I still got the game to handle all you bitch niggas
So a nigga's always strapped

You was playin' when you was sayin' you was ready
I'm knowin' you ain't mean it when you told me you was tired of life
And just wanted to leave it you was drinkin'
So I ain't really pay it no attention
Took you back to your crib and dropped you off
With the intention of gettin' with this Asian bitch
I’ve been off in Visionz, somethin' exquisite
I had to spit that game, she was vicious
I'm hoppin' back on 6-10 punchin' the drop
On my way out to her house I started noticing cops
Somethin' tellin' me to turn around and follow these dudes
Normally I wouldn't consider but out of the blue I'm bustin' a U
I get off where they get off at
Well-familiar with these streets, this where I came up at
Roadblocks, yellow tape, "a crime scene" they say
What the fuck just happened? I just left this place...
I get out and started walkin' askin' Frog, "What's up?"
Lookin' at me dazed like, "Face, it's all fucked up..."
I move a little closer tryin' to see who it is
And I saw his baby mama in tears holdin' his kids...

I ain't﻿ whole in the inside I'm hurting I can't explain whats going on in me
Stop it now with all the lies I'm knowing this ain't how my life's supposed to be

And it was then it finally hit me
I'm standing here nervous as I can be
It was nothing that can prepare me for what I'm finna see
I'm praying this is a dream and I'm bout to awake
But the closer I got the more I realize fate
Wasn't fair to change for me
And why would I think so
My homie had a date with death
He had to make though
I'm feelin' eerie, I'm liftin' up the yellow tape
By the time I get to the scene
They rollin' this away
I wonder whats under this sheet, my knees get weak
To the point I had to take me a seat
This shit's deep
When they put a nigga down that you was raised around
What was once a minor statement's turnin' major now
Never woulda thought in years that my homie was suicidal
Had it all; money and kids and a wife that read the bible
They say it's life and death in the slum
He had his reasons I shoulda believed him
Anotha soul no longer breathin'
Hate to say it but this one been heavy on my conscience
My nonchalantness just took a life over some nonsense

I ain't﻿ whole in the inside I'm hurting I can't explain whats going on in me
Stop it now with all the lies I'm knowing this ain't how my life's supposed to be

And everybody thinkin' it's murder, but homicide sayin' self-inflicted
By the way the body was sitting, brains in the kitchen
Who coulda predicted
But the detectives who was fishin'
Fucked up that the family had to see dad in his position
All I remember was us doin' what we did
To survive in these streets where we lived
We was kids growin' up in this environment
Nothing but trouble
You either struggled or you hustled
Folded the bubble
Grade school til we dropped out, we had a plan
We was either finna be rich or die like a man
We did it all for the love of the hood, every journey
Imagine seein' your dawg lifeless across a gurney
I wonder what was goin' on
You shoulda said that you was feelin' mad
I coulda talked you outta that
But never will I see you again
Nor will your kids
Nor will your family or your friends
It's the end
Not even words I write in this song
Can right that wrong
My nigga is gone and life goes on

I ain't﻿ whole in the inside I'm hurting I can't explain whats going on in me
Stop it now with all the lies I'm knowing this ain't how my life's supposed to be
I started small time, dope game, pushin on the corner
Twenty cent cook-up, fifty flippers if you want 'em
Full of formaldehyde, my clothes wreakin marijuana
Cops rollin up on us, my neighborhood's like a sauna
Pistol-grippin, insurin won't nobody run up on us
But if they do, fuck 'em, we murderous nickel-dome 'em
I ain't playin no games, I'm on a mission fo' the change
Motherfuck being a lame, I'm ten toes in the game - deep
I can't slip, this whole world want me sleep
See I hustle like a predator and prey on the weak
And playin for keeps, 'cause see, it's a thin red line
Between a nigga gettin his and me gettin mine
And plus I'm a nigga with that feelin like it's my time
And anybody standin' in the way of that is dyin'
I bust nine—how many times I gotta warn you?
I ain't the one, be pushin buttons in the sight of my gun
I'm the real live version of the Corleone family
So I spit this clearly, so you hoes'll understand me

One wrong move, and I'ma have to leave you for the goons
Catch you slippin asleep in your bedroom and then (Explosion)
Get you Audi, now what the fuck was this dude thinkin?
You can cheat the rules of the streets, and not leave stinkin?

I can squeeze without blinkin, I'm a cold-blooded nigga
Bank robber (ooooh) I'm a natural born killer
Drug dealer, anything it took to survive
Even if it took a nigga to die, I'm a gangsta

I got a brick from a sucker that he wanted to move
But the whole while I'm cookin I'm like, "Fuck this dude"
It's on, thirty-six zones of my own
Keep the money fo' myself and take the work back home
Call that nigga on the phone, "Ay", I just got knocked
And the cops was askin bout you, come get me hot
Never showed, so fuck him and the money that I owed
I got a get rich quick scheme, steppin on the dope
It's cold, but that's it, I'm on it like I want it
And twenty-eight cash and change, the whole game on it
That means I'm on my feet and I can front the homies D
Break 'em off a couple of C, and double up they fee
Takin over, shoot up they spot, make it hot
And when the cops dry it out, put my work on the block
And if they wanna ride for they corners we ride right with 'em
Dummy move, whole thing, the goon squad get 'em


No mo' petty rock hustlin, I'm in for the run
And I'm fo'sho I'm gon' be murdered for this shit that I done
But I'mma die standin up cause I'm a stand up nigga
Fuck dyin like a bitch on my knees, I'm a killer
So don't nobody cry cause I was destined to get it
Just remember, I'm the one who took the dope game and flipped it
And pimped it, and destroyed everything in the way
Of me seein first motherfuckin light of the day
A trigger man, deadly as fuck with a loaded AK
Spot my enemy and kill him the American way
I turned a dream into reality, with a fuck you mentality
Silencin all these niggas in the neighborhood who challenged me
Family grievin from they loved one's mortality
He ain't got a reason to die then kill him, it's a tragedy

Right?
I know God is watching from above
Sometimes I wonder what I'd do without his love
And although life is full of adversities
I know he's with me, he's with me
I know someday, someday, someday...
Someday, someday, someday...
Someday, someday, someday
He'll come to get me

I wanna walk with you, follow in your footsteps
Talk with you to find out where my goods kept
I been gone away from home for so long
Seems like everything I try to do without you go wrong
I'm confused about a lot of things, but not with my fate
So I'm depending on your holy ghost to guide me the way
See I'm a sinner in the 3rd degree
Ain't afraid to admit it, cause I seen niggas worse than me
Who am I to judge a man when I'm a man myself
In the dark, trying to get me some help
I went from pawn to king, king back to pawn
Doing my best to try to ease out the storm
I know that every tunnel's got an end and a light
And I prepared a new beginning in Christ
My life is like a jigsaw dulling in time
And as I'm thumbing through this jigsaw puzzle of mine


It seems like every other Wednesday I'm attending a wake
But I don't question you, I know that's your way, ok
I know we living for the minute and there's a moment in time
We've got to leave here, cause that's your design
And nothing lasts forever, not even spirit, only your word
That's what I live by, cause that's what I heard
I wasn't there when you rose from the dead or parted the sea
I never seen you, but still I believe
How you explain the moon, the sky, the stars and the rain
The sun and the sea, the earth without form facing the deep
In darkness challenging the powers that be
It's impossible for scientists to make up the seeds, to make up the trees
So why we turn our backs on the truth?
It's heaven or hell, the point we seem to hide from the youth
And I was singing this morning, got touched by the spirit
So I wrote it down for the homies to hear it


Lord I know that I've been wrong
They say a man is lost without a prayer, without a song
So I'm singing on my knees cause I believe you'll keep me strong
Until it's time for me to bring it home
But until it's time for me to bring it home
I'll be out in these streets, hanging in the hood
Even gangsters need to pray, cause when I pray it's understood
That I got flaws about myself, I can't make it by myself
I need the heaven's help, I want to follow in your foot steps
Done seen the strongest man bow down to a higher power
And given all his glory to God cause God towers
Over all, and in that I save this prayer
For all my homies that's been trapped out there
That's stuck in their ways, it's different now than back in the days
So fuck what they say, cause ain't no coming back from the grave
So when the gun goes pop and the lights go out
Then you'll understand what I'm talking about


I just want to be your solider
I just want to be your vessel, woooo lord
Ho! It's young 'Face, slanging yay everyday
Heavyweight, got a bad bitch in every state
On the grind non-stop till I touch this cake
Mark ass niggas stay the fuck up out my way
I'm a true OG, you can quote what I say
I'm an H-town nigga from around the way
Southside, Ridin' Dirty like I'm UGK
Asshole by nature like my name was Trae
And I don't gangbang, I patrol the game
And what I'm representing here is putting holes in brains
Before I say the same thing I'll be old and grey
'Fore I fall off and rap about my clothes and chains
Gripping grain and popping trunks, dog but that ain't me
These elbows hit the scene back in eighty-three
I stay street, when it's done, that's that
You could find me in your hood pumping monster crack
I roll over rodents in Rovers with rims on 'em
Sniffing out a rat I expose him and then dome him
A lot of nigga's bitches, they claim that they OGs
A straight up pussy and claims that he knows me
You see I, putting out these DVDs
Now my shit done hit the streets, he gots to squat the pee
Got the Feds on his team so they watching me
Mousetrap for a rat, pussy watch and see
 + {UTP}
I've been straight {for a long time}
Getting cake {for a long time}
E&J {for a long time}
Nigga {try to get like this!}
I've been a G {for a long time}
In the street {for a long time}
Toting heat {for a long time}
Nigga {try to get like this!}
{I got big dog status} *8X*

Hey I'm they fave
They say pressure busts pipes, but I ain't scared
It's my pleasure to tell it right, don't think I ain't said
Cause they got prices on my head homie, I don't slip
Clips long as giraffe necks, that's why I don't trip
Just open up and let it rip, ain't nothing new to a G
Hey I ain't worried about these niggas till they shooting at me
My partner died, daughter too, give excuses to me
Still a buster ass rapper I'm refusing to be
Scarface seem to say I'm the king, you a fool if you think
There's another young new rapper dude out there cooler than me (Haha)
I cruise in the V, brand new with the beat
I live a real life like I say I do in the beat
Yo, true indeed, I do indeed
Do it for the OG's and the true MC's
Them busters say this year I got brand new and it's all phat
Cut that fighting in the club, I'm done with all that
Nigga ass out of line, well his ass getting wet
Give a west side nigga ten stacks, that's that
Oh, or maybe less as a matter of fact
Nigga be testing the professor, what's the matter with cats?


I've been doing this shit, nigga who are you?
Lil nigga, I done seen keys bigger than you
Lil nigga, you ain't know shit
Cut off a nigga head, make him suck his own dick
How the game go? Money over bitches and flowers over snitches
Money over bitches and flowers over snitches
Mr., Mr. Scarface, pistols into y'all face
Mr., Mr. Scarface, pistols into y'all face
Yeah!

I came here to exercise my game
Spread love to the hood is how I do my thang
Smoking weed with my homies, barbeque them wangs
Sip Hennesey and coke cause I don't fuck with drank
Don't pop pills either cause that shit ain't cool
We just drunk a Mad Dog 'fore we went to school
Flick off, back then I was smashing boys
Jump wrong, you saw a nigga get his ass destroyed
Same rules right now, I demand respect
And if I slapped one ho, then her man was next
I'm a kick door robber, a hot-shot driver
A crack rock slanging motherfucker for a dollar
If it's a dare to be made, then I'm finna make it
But if it ain't no way, then believe I'm finna take it
Cause a nigga with no hustle, it ain't worth this G
And a bitch like this is even worse than that
I've been good at bullshitting but this game can cost
And if a nigga can't maintain, mayne he lost
He a nerd, and they fuck nerds in jail I heard
And as a nigga, I come in here with my balls and my word
Snuck up behind him, had his hands in his pocket
Took my pistol out, unlocked it
Pulled the hammer back and - cocked it
And left his shit all on the carpet
I seen a (murder, murder) I pin-pointed my target
I'm making my way up out the building
I got the nigga that I came here to get, notify his children
That they old man done fell up out the game
Because I came through this motherfucka
And killed his ass just like Jesse James

Think it's a motherfuckin game?
I come around this muthafucka and kill yo ass just like Jesse James
What's my motherfuckin name?

There'll be no witnesses to this homicide
No re-enactment on the late night news to be re-dramatized
All you got is a nigga with a dot
In the middle of his motherafuckin head he been shot
Dropped in the middle of the floor and he ain't breathin
And the nigga's on the go cause we ain't seen him
He did his dirt and got the fuck up out the picture
The hollow point just hitcha, out of line, so it got witcha
Call the motherfuckin helicopter
But ain't no hope, cause the Tina broke that nigga off a hella proper
That oughta hold your monkey ass (motherfucka, you)
That oughta teach your funky ass (motherfucka, you)
I know this motherfuckin game is sheist
And you done lost the fuckin game of life
And that's a motherfuckin shame
You let a nigga come around and do yo ass just like Jesse James

Think it's a motherfuckin game?
I come around this muthafucka and kill yo ass just like Jesse James
What's my motherfuckin name?

Wait - this motherfucka got me bent, I gots to - break
Because this nigga done put his hands all up in my - face
He best to chill before I hit him with this - mace
And catch this motherfuckin case
Cause once I got him blind, then he done with
Because I'm true to myself, fuck the dumb shit
You ain't no motherfuckin gangsta, gee
And when I get up out your ass you gon' realize it just ain'tsta be
It ain't no studio up in me
And all that bullshit I'm hearin you talk only offends me
And lately I'm under a lot of pressure
It seems to me you can't come clean, so yo, I gots to check ya
I pull my .45 and (buck, buck, buck, buck)
And right before he die I (fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck)
I could give a motherfuck about the sentence
I snatch yo ass up off the hinges cause I'm (SCREAMING FOR VENGEANCE)
Cause life has no meaning, no meaning
We were all born to die, so no screaming
Think it's a motherfuckin game?
I'll come around this motherfucka and cut yo ass just like Jesse James
Blow out your motherfuckin brains

Think it's a motherfuckin game?
I come around this muthafucka and kill yo ass just like Jesse James
What's my motherfuckin name?
Sunday morning I'm off at church
Sinnin' throughout the week, hustlin' every day
Gettin' it as we speak, listen to preacher preach
Choir singing the song, annie clapping her hands
Momma singing along, I'm impatient I wanna leave
Can't let my Momma see, I ain't listening to the word
Not like I don't believe, but I'm trippin' nobody perfect
To speak it wouldn't worth it for a person to be so Christ like
But I swear, I heard him cursin'
Let him without no sins cast the first stone
But I am so not him so let me go on on
Get home and he will find his hat on
Who's family when this all went on
Come on, let's see, some laughs, then we
Can do the same damn thing again next week
I love it when It happens like that
I smile cause it's not all bad

You know they say that no one's perfect
That's why we struggle every day
Just know that every single day is a blessing
I'm just tryna find my way
I keep my head above water (keep my head above water)
Tell me what's the use of lookin' sad
Keep your head above water
Cause it ain't all bad

Monday mornin' it's back to business
Cash the motivation, cops steady watchin'
Plottin' and waiting patient
Yeah I been thinkin' lately
Prayin' on even maybe
Probably best if I left it
The stress will drive you crazy if you let it
The penitentiary is where were headed
Designed for downfalls and some still don't get it
And yeah I might have said it way back and got sweated by
The same ones that hittin' it now but no credit came to me
If you can see the things I see
Then you could point your fingers at the blame not me
Ashamed how we can't stand one another
We hate the idea of a unified young brother so we suffer
But I adapt cause I'm a hustler
I still stay strapped with the muffler
I'm ten toes trapped in the struggle cause
I'm what the hood made mothafucka what

You know they say that no one's perfect
That's why we struggle every day
Just know that every single day is a blessing
I'm just tryna find my way
I keep my head above water (keep my head above water)
Tell me what's the use of lookin' sad
Keep your head above water
Cause it ain't all bad

As solid these niggas come, realist they ever made
Money is not important it's livin' it how you say
Picture back in the day, me moving a brick a week
Murdered you if I had to nigga I'm from the streets
And out here were playing for keeps, speak and your getting froze
Neck gettin' wrapped in sheets, sneakers will be exposed
This bullet here for your soul
Bitches is just for sex, that said I could jack my dick
She don't deserve respect, I'm knowin' my niggas feel it
Nothin' is fabricated authentic as I can say it
The only way I play it, this is for Curtis Davis
Mothers of fallen soldiers, Children of murdered fathers
Fathers out on the corners
Corners I'm standing on and I love 'em without a reason
Feelin they aid the bleedin' they made me I'm never leavin'
Though the looks can look deceiving
Believe me yall it might sound sad
But trust me dog it's not all bad

You know they say that no one's perfect
That's why we struggle every day
Just know that every single day is a blessing
I'm just tryna find my way
I keep my head above water (keep my head above water)
Tell me what's the use of lookin' sad
Keep your head above water
Cause it ain't all bad
You win some, you lose some, life in a nutshell
Free all my niggas on locked down, fuck jail
I've seen enough hell to never wanna live there
Tattooed teardrops, sitting in a wheelchair
Kids on the streets doing bad, momma moved out
Dopeman pushing on the corner where the schoolhouse sits
This is bullshit, this can't be life
I can't blame it on the hood 'cuz it gave me  life
This a stick-up, don't turn it to a 187
I don't go to church so I'm far from a Reverend
Ain't nothing like a young nigga, armed with an AK
Walking up the sidewalk, shooting in the broad day
Fuck what a broad say, I'm all day villain
I'm getting money so I'm always chilling
And even though they say I'm killing all they children
I'm just a nigga hustling for my million dollars

You know I stay rooted
I stay rooted
I and I stay rooted
Crooked officer, crooked officer
I stay rooted (beh!)
I and I stay rooted

Now if I had to play Jack, I'll be leaving you bad news
Everybody in here be bound and gagged too
I'm postin' at your crib nigga hurry yo ass home'
You was out here hi-capping and all yo stash gone
The money met the work and that's a real life no-no
It don't take a bunch of niggas, just me solo
I go for dolo, I can't tell on myself
Immature ass niggas get you sentenced to death
Loud talking in the tank like he a stone cold killer
And you fighting a murder charge, my nigga?
The moral of the story is keeping your mouth shut
'Cause everybody is listening, speaking you fucked up
I tell you like them old cats say: get what you get and get your ass out the way
'Cause greed'll get you 35 type, you're 27, that's the rest of your fucking life

[You know I stay rooted
I stay rooted]
I and I stay rooted
Crooked officer, crooked officer
I stay rooted (beh!)
I and I stay rooted
(It's in my DNA, my blood type G, my roots is deep up in these motherfucking streets)

Real recognize what's real, the bullshit see through
The way I spit it, ain't another one that's equal
This for my people in the game ten toes, rooted in the streets, and withholding info
We got secrets we gon' take to the grave
We don't honor nothing else, except the rules of getting paid
And no wonder why a motherfucker hustling dope
Everything we doing legal eagle leaving us broke
What I hope is that a nigga don't forget where he from
And turn his back on his hood cause he's seeing some crumbs
And no money in the world that's enough to respect, when somebody take a gun and put it up to your chest
Saying 'fuck it' at the same time he squeezing a round
You can blame it on your homeboy for keeping you down
If it was me, I'd be leery of the people I meet, cuz in this motherfucking game niggas playing for keeps

You know I stay rooted
I stay rooted
I and I stay rooted
Crooked officer, crooked officer
I stay rooted (beh!)
I and I stay rooted
I would, never violate the codes of the streets
And I would never make a promise, that I know I couldn't keep
And I would, never testify, cop out for a plea
Or surrender information on my boys to the police
And you could, never catch me on the block without a strap
And I would, never pull it out unless I'm bouts to black
And I could, never forget my homies dyin for they scratch
Forever pourin out liquor for 'em, God send me back
And I'll, never shed tears, my heart is like a stone now
Never thought I'd live to see 21 look I'm grown now
Never say never they tell me all the time
Cause never means it's forever, but it's never crossed my mind
And I'll, never go broke, I promise I'mma shine
Never come short on my issue, I'm on it every time
And I'll, never be passive, you better gimme me mine
It's my money, and I want it, every motherfuckin dime
No I, never forgot all my struggles in the past
And I could, never forget how to hustle for my cash
And I will, never forget how I felt when I saw Brad
Take that first breath and from then, I knew I had to mash
And it could, never be said I went out like a ho
Never been punked, I'll never let it slide, never let it go
Never ever, never ever ever no
Get on my level ho, or get a shovel ho
It's never any question for my manhood I get down
I'll never switch, never snitch, never sit down
I'll never hesitate to squeeze a nigga six rounds
I'll never squat to take a piss, who's the bitch now
I never ran, I never will, I ain't never scared
It's in my bloodline, the realest nigga ever bred
And that's some of the realest shit that I done ever said
And I can die but through my lyrics, I ain't never dead
I'll never disrespect my momma, never disrespect her momma neither
I'll never turn my back on Jesus
I'll never get caught off in the system, cause I believe a
Man that follows man, ain't no man, and I'm a leader
Never go turncoat my nigga, I could never trade
I'll never cross my homies out, that I ain't how I'm made
And I never had not one regret, on how I was raised
I'm from the ghetto, where I slung and rapped it every day
Never knew no other way, this ain't gon' never change
Never gon' bite my tongue, FUCK what nigga say
100 with myself I swore to God I'd stay the same
And when I finally got my paper, I was on my game
I'll never talk a nigga down, do yo' thang dawg~!
Never hate a dude for tryin, that's insane dawg
Get yo' motherfuckin money, that's the thang dawg
Too many homies dyin young, feel my pain y'all
(Riiinnnngggg) "Dont answer that"
"Hello, I'm not at home, leave a message" (beep)
"Yo, bitch, this is (beep) pick up the phone, bitch
I know you're in there
You fucking with that old fucking ass 'Face now, huh bitch
Where my motherfucking kids at, bitch
Fucking bitch, punk ass bitch!"

Hey, today must be my lucky day
I turned the corner, hit the block and seen that ass from a mile away
(Now where's she stayin'?) She must be new in the hood
But I ain't trippin' on that shit, cause it's all good
I rolled up on her, and I asked her her name
Ain't a damn thing changed , ain't no shame in my game
She said, "Used to go Thomas"
I slowed my roll, cause she just might be one of my homies' babies mamas
Now where your man at, she said "Gone at work"
Gave me the look, I cracked a smile and thinkin', "Go on and flirt"
My homies women ain't no thing to me
Cause if they caught one of my ho's, they'd do the same to me
And furthermore she was peepin' my ride
Convertible, '64, with the ride inside
Super clean with the discs and vogues
Higher than a fuck spittin' this to hoes
(CHORUS)
Please excuse my attitude, sorry if I'm being rude
But I've got something to say to you
Hoping you won't lose your cool
I wanna sneak you out to play with me
You can spend the day with me
And we can ride and see the sights
It's going down tonight . 

Reminiscin' on the bitch that I had back in the day
Gave the bitch a call and she hung up in my face
Now thats the pits
She didn't have to put up a front
I stuck that ass back in there
And haven't called her for 3 months
I guess it's in me to be doggin' a chick
Can't understand how you niggas just be hogging your bitch
Go on and pass her, unass her, send her to the master
Let her take a ride with the Bradster
It's cool, don't front, no sex, no sweat
Not even on my mind, we just met
And furthermore, we can get to those
But for now I'm rolling 'Raris spitting this to hoes:
CHORUS

Now I'm cruisin' to the crib with this bitch that I scooped
Parked my Ferrari, now I'm back in the coup
I knocked her boots - your baby's mama put me to work
I tagged that ass from the back, and knocked her shit in the dirt
She wanted me badly so I put it inside
She got the (front, back, and side to side)
Back and forth with the gangster glide
Started off at 6 and didn't finish till 9
Hit the showers like I been out playing ball for the day
Now she's asleep, cause she just had her drawers full of dick
(now thats sick) and plus she got you staying at home
With the kids all alone while she's gettin' her fuck on
So believe me when you downin' the Brad
I'm at the pad with your baby mama clowning that ass
So player hatin' niggas check the bitch you chose
I'll be mobbing in my 'benz spitting this to hoes:
CHORUS
What can I do?
What can I do, to make it better?
Yeah, yeah

I thank the Lord, for every morning, he allows me to rise
And though the sun is shining, there's a cloud in the sky
Lettin' me know, that at any moment, there could be rain
And as beautiful as life is, there still can be pain
Down the park, I hear the sirens, just a screamin' away
And then the inevitable happens, the end of them days
As sad as it sounds, but that's the price we all gotta pay
And the whole world knows God giveth, will taketh away (will taketh away)
I live and I learn, I sit and watch my cigarette burn
Down to the ash, it reminds me of the now and the past
I say me a prayer, cause eventually I'll stand in the path
Of the souls and dark roads that lead to rest

Do you hear them, crying?
Waiting for someone to come and dry their tears (someone like you and me)
Take away their fears

And then a child is born
Bloody naked, clingin' to life
Unaware of his surroundings or if breathin' is right
In the arms of his mother as he looks in her eyes
He takes his first breath and he screams (baby's alive)
At the same time, another mother, murders her kids
And the unbearable thought of this here just brings me to tears
It's hard enough we gotta raise our kids to live in this world
So full of hate with no faith, and killin' your pearls
And sometimes, I sit it down, and wonder myself
But then again, I ain't Jesus, and I couldn't help
All I can do, is hope I never live with the fact
That I hurt one of my seeds ‘cause dealin’ with that
Would be the hardest thing, I’d ever have to do in my time
I'd have to take my own life too, and I couldn't climb
The stairway that you hear me singin' bout in my rhyme
And a parent hurtin' his kid ain't decidin' the time
I know it's truth, the next day, we just livin' to die
But I believe if you livin' right, you'll live in the sky
Lookin' down on the good and the bad, the world as a whole
And hopefully you did what you did, before you had to go

Do you hear them, crying?
Waiting for someone to come and dry their tears
(someone to dry their tears) Take away their fears
Can I make it, better? (I want to make it better)
Can I ease the pain that they are goin' through? (they're through)
What can I do?
What can I do?

I say goodbye to you cruel world, I see peace in the red sky
I see the beast when the dead die, relief when my head’s high
Hear the streets up ahead cry, when the heat from the lead fly
Felt the grief when I said bye, 'fore the sheets on my bed dried
The turn of the table, the tale of the tape
The destruction of human flesh of the not so great
The long list of the John Doe’s that accompany the spirit
As the yells of the souls lost with hopes that god hears it
The resurrections of empty hearts crowd in the room
Muffled sounds of the outside echo the tomb, but I’m cool, I’m cool
(Kelly Price)
Do you hear me?
I'm cryin'

Do you hear them, crying? (x2 to fade)
Waiting for someone to come and dry their tears
(someone to dry their tears)
Take away their fears (take away their fears)
Can I make it, better? (gonna make it better)
Can I ease the pain that they are goin' through?
(everything they're goin' through) What can I do?
What can I do?
(Say, Face .. nigga, I think I can fade you now)
What, fade me how?
(Sheeit, on this rap shit)
Come on, nigga..
I brought my chopper and my hard hat
The shit's fucked up now show a nigga where the war at
Cause I'm about to clean house
Stick this a.k. up your ass and blow that fucker clean out
Cause you niggas in the wrong
You came up short and now we fin to get it going on
I ain't your average motherfucker
You step out of line and watch a motherfucker bust ya
Cause you done came at me the wrong way
I ain't no Clint Eastwood, nigga, and you done picked the wrong day
So bring your ass to the battleground
Rat-a-tat-tat, like that is how my gat'll sound
Avoid no niggas cause niggas be human
I squeeze the trigger and niggas be moving
Cause I don't point it in the air and pull the trigger (why?)
I'd rather point it at your ass and watch the nigga die
I gives a fuck about your team mates
When it's all said and done you're gonna wish you never seen 'face
You shoulda seen that lil nigga Brad
James through here, seen Dave and, yo that nigga bad
And your homies better stand still
Don't make my brother Warren bust one of you bitches cause the man will
Don't bring your ass to my picnic
Cause I done had it up to here with all you niggas talking that bitch shit
So you better get your shit right
I'm from the state where you rarely see a motherfucking fist fight
It's all about the gun blast
So you can miss me with that bullshit you spitting with your punk ass
It's the diary of a born killer
Don't have to worry about me falling off this thang cause I'm a strong nigga
Doubt my regard of the hard
With niggas behind me from East Oakland to the South Park
I've got the mind of the man right behind ya
You can run, you can hide but I'll still find ya
Like I say there's no getaway
And I'm gon' have it where your family'll have to throw your shit away
It's the return of the real niggas
I'm prejudiced to a certain extent but still I kill niggas
I'll bust that ass on the fucking double
So push on with that ho shit, bitch, cause you don't want trouble
So get your ass up of my shoestrings
And let your shermed nigga do things
Ay, ay, ay where you fin to go, fool?
(I can't fuck with it, you got it, man)
Come on, man .. you wanna rap, nigga?
(I can't do it) Come on
You see, you see! That's how motherfucker is, dogg
That's how motherfuckers be, punk ass hoes
You motherfuckers better quit fucking with me like this
That's really doe
* a/k/a/ "Look Into My Eyes"

Look me in my eyes, tell me what you see
Do you think I'm cra-zy??? (AAAAAGHHH!! Just bein me)
Sometimes I wanna die, maybe I'll be free
Free from all this bullshit that's constantly surroundin me
(I can feel it in my head) I see when I'm asleep
I don't wish to discustin, cause it done been too deep
I'm tired of bein' stepped on, and past around like weed
Look me in my eyes (Look me in my eyes)
And tell me what you see (and tell me what you see)
Can you see my future, and what lies down the line?
Is it just my test, or is it just my time?
Time for me to pay, for all the wrong I've did
I forgot to get picked off, when i was just a kid
A poison in my mind, tryin to find relief
But I can't get no peace, cause Shoemaukers been chasin me
Tryin' to set me up, bustin down my streets
Blockin' up my door, to see if he can catch me
But I don't sell no dope, so fuck what niggas say
Fuck Ronnie Carbone(?), and fuck the D.E.A
And fuck these undercovers, that lock me up for weed
You can search me all you want to, but you won't find no cheese
And I ain't finna snitch, cause I don't know a thang
Don't ask me shit bout Steve, don't ask me shit bout Jane
I know you crackrs pissed off, I can see it in your eyes
I'm down with Rap-A-Lot, until the day that I die
(Until the day that I die)
So fuck you in ya asses, you know it's all a lie
You just wanna destroy me, just like you did my god
But now I must expose you, and tell my boys the truth
Listen up my niggas: "The F.B.I. been watchin' you"
Especially if you black, and tryin to leave the streets
And get off in this music, you see the way they doin me
Runnin in my crib, makin niggas lie
Nigga get a scapegoat and take this 25
You know I ain't no dopeboy, ain't never been a mule
I admit I use to sell rocks, but that was back in school
Now I just do music, and smoke a little weed
But not enough to run a dope house, so why you fuck with me?

Look me in my eyes!
Will you look in my eyes, and tell me do you see what I see?(My eyes!)
Will you look in my eyes, and tell me do you see a Geeeeeeeee?

Look me in my eyes, I've told all I could tell you
And now you know too much, if you leak a word I'll kill you
You think that I'm insane, partially deranged?
You've had your chance to pick my brain, now explain
What's up with all these nightmares, this long rewinding road
That leads me to the same place I started from;
Right before I left home
(Look me in my eyes!) I thought you was a shrink
Diagnosed my symptons, I give you time to think
OK your time is up, now analyze my life
Please remove your glasses, look me in my eyes
(Look me in my eyes, my eyes)
You seemed to be confused, I raised up off his sofa
Put back on my shoes, because this sessions over
I headed for the door, he stopped me in my tracks
He said he had an answer, he told me to come back
He spoke the book of Matthew then he spoke the book of Luke
But he stopped at Revelations, when he just spoke the truth
And told me all my answers, I would find in his book
If I just stopped and looked, if I just stopped and looked
Told me to seek in he who seeks he shall find
Then he put back on his glasses, and looked me in my eyes
Looked me in my eyes
(2x)
(And meanwhile, on the Southside of town...)
Chorus:
Now when you're rollin' through yo' muthafuckin' hood
What do you see?
(I see some muthafuckin' G's)
Now when you're rollin' through yo' muthafuckin' hood
Tell me what you see?
(Some muthafuckin' G's)
(Verse 1)
Roamin' in my muthafuckin' hood and thangs
Seems to me my mutherfuckin' hood done changed
Cause niggas used to kick it with the rival gangs
But now we gots to deal with them survival thangs
.45 in my lap when I'm on the creep
Niggas livin' shife, so I roll one deep
Cause now they see me flippin' in the 1-9-9-4
C.S.I. nigga, black 850
And now they lookin' at me crazy
But off-brand niggas can suck a dick because they can't fade me
And if it came down to the gun, black
I never cracked up under pressure, cause I was trained for combat
So get yo' muthafuckin' boys together
I represent S.A., nigga, and we makin' noise forever
And gettin' paid at the same time
So you respect a muthafucka when a muthafucka claim mine
Cause if you disrespect, you ass out
And they we rolling through yo' shit in the Glasshouse
Actin' bad with the flashers on
Makin' niggas get they asses on
Cause ain't no mutherfuckin' love for fools
Who come around this muthafucka trying to scrub, you fools
It ain't no haps on it, hops
We snaps on the cops
And straps on the Glocks
And take the law into our own hands
Cause you ain't fucking with a rookie, nigga, you fucking with a grown man
And we gon' show you what we mean by funk
Muthafucka, you ain't see my trunk
I got a (SK) and a (AK)
And a (12 gauge) that'll fuck a nigga whole day
So recognize a real nigga from the streets
When you rolling through yo' mutherfuckin' hood, what do you see?
Chorus...
(Verse 2)
Hollerin at my homie at the swisher house
Scored a 40 bag and we hit the spot
Put my shit in park and got up under the tree
Pull the swishers out and gave the ganja to 3
Rapped us up a fattie and we started to smoke
Eyes gettin' red cause we higher than coke
A nigga chillin' cause it's all good
And we ain't trippin' on the bullshit, nigga, because we all hood
But other niggas don't wanna see it that way
But all I got to say is: you don't wanna see that S.A
Because we're all upon a mission
Killin don't make us no different
And dyin don't make it no different
Cause I done been to mo' wakes in this past year
Than the muthafuckin Bengals lost last year
So ain't no muthafuckin' thang for me
To kill a nigga who ain't fuckin' with the gang with me
Chorus...
(Verse 3)
Formaldehyde smokin, niggas gettin' loc'ed and
Ready to pull your coat and leave your stomach open
Scoping, hoping for you to fuck up and slip
So we can have a reason for fuckin' up your shit
(It ain't no muthafuckin' peace when they see me)
Cause we never had a muthafuckin' peace treaty
So I know I got to get em with game
And when I hit em with the game I gotta hit em with this damn thang
Cause it's kill or be killed, never cut slack
And if you cut slack, they bust back, fuck that
I never give a second chance to pull the first gun
Cause if they bust one time, that be the worst one
And that's the one that can close the shop
So you gotta stand and hold the Glock
Cause in my muthafuckin' hood, that's how it be
But when you're rollin' through your muthafucking hood, what do YOU see?
Chorus...
(Bun B)
I always wanted to be the biggest man in somethin
Had to find my place
But the world can leave a foul taste on the tongue
Had to dodge a case
Had to dodge a bullet
And the nigga that tried to pull it
The streets is throwed
If I don't get lean and blowed everyday
I feel just like I'mma explode on overload and overdrive
All my life this drive I tried
I seen a lot of good niggas die
Cause somebody hated somebody lied or somebody snitched
Or somebody's a bitch
I wish I could change the past
But I gots to live in the present and pray
That tomorrow this shit don't last, I'm livin to fast
Shit, my momma asked me who I was like she ain't know me
But, to tell the truth I didn't know myself
I found out she had to told me
Just to show me just how good I had it
I guess I couldn't see it
Mild-mannered I just couldn't be it
But that was just the way we used to G it
One of the wrongest niggas I see
Or one of the strongest niggas I know
Walkin on my tippy-toe cause the life I live ain't long and I know
So I put weed in the bong and I blow
Stay cool calm and collected a neglected
Child that grew into a man that's widely respected
Too real
(Chorus)
I feel no pain
I can't complain
Stuck in the game
Tryin to maintain
Cause I'm so real
(Pimp C)
We blow big everyday
But that don't stop our pain
Or bring back our homeboys that we done lost off in this dirty game
Got niggas doin 40
When you 25 that's life
I guess when your career is sellin dope somebody got to pay the price
These bitch ass niggas shife
Niggas might snitch out they momma
That's why me and Leroy watch stay strapped and ready for all drama
Cause we ain't promised tommorow
But nigga you promised to die
Nigga can't you see you gettin to high trippin of that potent fry
At night I talk to God and try to understand
How people can worship false prophets and say prayers to a man
I guess they already gone, ain't nothin gone bring them back
So I just say thanks for what I got and blow on indo sacks
I still love my piece and chain, wood grain and big head ones
But I had to realize in life everything ain't always fun
I guess that's true for some
But them hoes will never win
Out here just hustlin and grindin
Tryin to change from niggas to men
Chorus
(3-2)
My nigga you a ho to me
Boy you done went off on me
Runnin round with the fakin and hatin
I'mma blast if you run up on me
I'mma do my dirt by my lonely so that nobody can snitch
This matter coulda been resolved
If you woulda came clean and paid my shit
See niggas disrespect the game but boy you'll never last
Pullin that ho shit sellin your partner out for a piece of ass
And fool you claim you real but really need to be shot up
No respect for your family that's dead
Don't write yo peoples locked up
Damn I miss my dog he was hog to this game
Unlike bustas these days that talk down on your name
You boys is funny
I'm bout my money
And oh so true
Mr. 3-2 when I never trusted you
I'm too real
Chorus
(Scarface talking)
Yo anybody seen my diary? Oh there it is
I gotta write this shit down. Check it out
Dear Diary, I'm having a little problem
I can't make it by myself maybe you can help me solve em
I'm confused and I don't know what to do
I'm hoping you can help me cause there's no one else to talk to
I want to die, but it ain't for me
I try to talk to my dad, but my old man ignores me
He says I'm delirious
And I drink too much, so he doesn't take me serious
But little does he know I'm really losing it
I got a head, but ain't no screws in it
I be thinking deep
That's one of the reasons at night I can't sleep
I thought it would change when I was older
But even now I'm still peeping over my shoulder
Is there life after death too?
And what about the nigga with the cane and the black suit?
And what about cancer?
Too many motherfucking questions, and not enough answers
Ain't no use in trying
We might as well face it we were all born dying
There's a black book in Brad's hands
And its the diary of a madman
(chorus)
Dear diary today I hit a nigga with the torch
Shot him on his face and watched him die on his front porch
Left his family heartbroken
Flashbacks of him laying there bleeding with his eyes open
I can't put the shit behind me
I'm know I'm here somewhere, but I can't find me
I used to be a drug dealer
On the fo rilla, now I'm a born killer
And it ain't no changing me
It used to be hard, but now it ain't no thing to me
To go up to a niggas house
Put a pistol in his mouth, and blow his fucking brains out
No doubt if you cross then I'mma take ya
Cause I'm a fucking killer by nature
You got an M11, bring your weapon
Huh, I got an AK-47
It's gonna be a bloody Sunday
Cause your fucking with a nigga like Bundy
And I was taught not to care
Like a Vietnam vet with a thousand yard stare
So welcome to the slaughterhouse nigga
Redrum and I'mma be the grave digger
And if you want to cap, come cap me
I'm trigger happy like my great-grandpappy
Just watch for the chrome in my right hand
My second entry from the diary of a madman
(Chorus)
Dear diary, help me cause I'm frantic
S-sometimes I think I'm going schizophrenic
The world's looking dark for instance
Maybe cause I'm looking from a distance
But then again I wear a blindfold
Staring at the motherfucking world with my eyes closed
To myself I'm a stranger
Walking in the footsteps of danger
It's a long path ahead of me
I gotta get somewhere cause everybody here is scared of me
I had a job but they fired me
My wife walked off now I'm living in my diary
I got the new 'Face tape I'm about to, pop in the deck for you niggas
Turn up your radios

You're down and out, money funny, you hustle and die
On the verge of pawnin your jewelry and sellin your ride
Somebody shoulda told him ain't no life in these streets
You only out here 'til you touch it, when you touch it you eat
Niggas done took too many chances shovelin snow
And ended up facin a lifetime for tryin to sco'
I'm givin livin definitions on the subject of dope
One week he back on his feet, the next he's WHOA
I was a 70's baby, raised in the 80's
I was barely touchin 16 when shit got crazy
I remember in the 80's, me and pop would ride
Now we conversate on acres we's about to buy
He had already been what I'm about to go through
Told me ain't no sense in gamblin if you gamble to lose
If you made twelve dollars, you put seven away
And lived off the five, and never ever fuck with your safe
But when

When he hustle and he robbin'
That's when niggas start plottin'
And when you niggas start plottin'
Us country niggas start mobbin', mobbin'

I'm bout my paper, these other niggas slang for the sport
Like unaware tomorrow ain't promised, the game is too short
I've witnessed niggas get it all and give it away
Gettin back was out of the question, they lived for today
Then the hunger pains start up, then the murderous plots
To set up, they fuckin homeboy to get what he got
I mean the ones he broke the bread with, the ones you don't want
To be the ones fuckin your girlfriend the moment you out
I know the street game backwards, forwards, sideways
It used to be an honest hustle back then but nowadays
It's cutthroat, that's fucked up, niggas want they come up
So bad they'll take the .357 and smoke they brother
A damn shame; but, that's the way the game go
A chance niggas is takin especially if they slang dope
I've been in that position, back in the day
In fear of my homie hittin' my head to crack in my safe
And that's when

When ya hustle ain't evolvin
That's when niggas start starvin
And when you niggas start starvin
That's when you niggas start robbin (when these niggas start robbin)
When these niggas got problems
That's when niggas start plottin
And when you niggas start plottin
Us country niggas start mobbin - mobbin

So listen up my niggas, and I ain't tryin to preach
I'm just tellin it from my side 'cause I'm in the streets
I done been there, done that, seen a whole neighborhood
Destroyed by the government bein tipped off by one rat
He caught a dope case and they threatened him with time
He get his own fuckin people jammed and he take the five
That's the shit there; they ain't even catch him with dope
But they gave him thirty-five years 'cause the nigga done spoke
Snitchin, that's a motherfucker, watch what you say
You don't know no-motherfuckin-body, nigga, you lame
Watch your so-called homeboys, keep to yourself
Stay away from niggas gettin caught that get out of jail
Don't talk about your business, keep yo' thoughts in yo' head
And this game it got a paper trail, watch where ya spend
Don't write down names and numbers, it's a memory thing
Never shit where ya sleep, keep the crib out of range
And plus you never let these niggas know where you stay
'Cause when the push turns to a shove, they hittin your safe
True motherfuckin' game, true motherfuckin' game

When ya hustle ain't evolvin'
That's when niggas start starvin'
And when you niggas start starvin'
That's when you niggas start robbin'
When these niggas got problems'
That's when niggas start plottin'
And when you niggas start plottin'
Us country niggas start mobbin', mobbin'
Chorus:
Money and the power, money and the power
I ain't fallin short I got the
Money and the power
Yup! Hehehahaha, hehe ha hah hah.. yeah
Money and the power, money and the power
Never goin back cause I got
Money and the power

Deep in the heart of South Park lurks a stalker
S.A. fool, native Houston South Parker
Born and brought up to be a heartless motherfucker
No one else to blame, fuck it blame it on my mother
When I was growin up nobody seemed to give a shit
And that's what makes me one hard son of a bitch
Since they ain't give a shit, I ain't give a shit either
Sweet 16, time to stack me up some ki's
Learned the game of hustlin, fuckin over fiends
Sellin niggas beat, in other words amphetamines
My game was more advanced, sellin speed I'm goin broke
Got em up with Floyd and Floyd had fronted me some dope
Learned to rock it up, now I got it sold
Time to go for broke, motherfuck who I owe
Business started boomin, started movin powder
Motherfuck the bitches I want money and the power.. yup!
Chorus:
Money and the power, money and the power
I ain't fallin short I got the
Money and the power
Yup!
Money and the power, money and the power
Bitches on my dick cause I got
Money and the power

Bought me a Caddy, 30's and vogues
Brand new crib, brand new clothes
Mom would ask questions, and often pitch a bitch
Where am I gettin the money? Mickey D's ain't paid me shit
I'd make up a story, just to get her off my back
Uh oh I got a beep I think my boys are out of crack
Everything was smooth, exactly how I played it
A dollar to be made, best believe a nigga made it
Nickels dimes and twenties, and sixty cent bumps
Nigga rollin hard, stackin paper like Trump
And I ain't give a fuck I told you that from the jump
Didn't worry about no static I had a motherfuckin pump
Ass out of line, word em up a nigga sprayed em
Momma told me shoot first, and ask questions later..
Six hundred bucks a motherfuckin hour
And I ain't fallin short cause I got money and the power, yup
Chorus:
Money and the power, money and the power
I ain't fallin short 'cause I got the
Money and the power
Yeah..
Money and the power, money and the power
I got it like dat, cause I got
Money and the power

There goes 21, and still stackin 30's
Brought my brother Warren Lee down from New Jersey
He helped me for a minute then he started screwin up
Said fuck gettin paid, I guess my brother'd rather fuck
Bitches ran his life, and they're still runnin Lee
I guess he doesn't realize the bitch is fuckin me
It really doesn't matter, cause Ak'll never tell
He can stay broke, but I got dope to sell
I step out on the cut, shit was lookin funny
I ran back in the house and started callin up my money
I signaled for my workers to bring in all the dope
I can feel the bust and sure enough in comes the 5-0
Niggas stayed relaxed but they was friskin niggas up
If someone said my name then I was definitely fucked
But I'mma play it cool, if I kill I gotta kill
Fightin for my shit, I never ran and never will
Come to find out, they wasn't fuckin with my boys
Busted a nigga who said he paid em, talkin noise
Hehehehehe.. I guess the juices are sour
But I ain't fallin short cause I got money and the power YUP!
Chorus:
Money and the power, money and the power
Sold a million records I got
Money and the power
Yup!
Money and the power, money and the power
Best to come clean, cause I got
Money and the power
Money and the power, money and the power
Money and the pow-the-pow-the-pow-the-pow-the-power!
Hook
The voices in my head are screaming louder than my lips
All the words I should have said are slipping through my fingertips
And ever after seems so far away from me
The voices in my head are screaming louder then my lips
Verse 1
It's like I have been living a lie
It's beautiful huh the way I can keep it inside
I'm settled in somebody's dream
Seeing through one of his eyes
Pieces of somebody's mind
Pictures of thoughts in the frame
I stand alone in the dark now
Sad and crippled and shamed
I loaded my pistol and aimed
Cocked it quick and then bang
Woke up in sweat feeling the death
Creates an eclipse in the brain
Sometimes I think I'm insane
I hear the voice when I'm asleep
Whispers my name again and again
This is what's she's singing to me
Hook
The voices in my head are screaming louder than my lips
All the words I should have said are slipping through my fingertips
And ever after seems so far away from me
The voices in my head are screaming louder then my lips
Verse 2
Sometimes I just want to cry
We kiss in the rain
She is speaking to me once again
Hands in my ear
But this isn't clear
I listen but nothings explained
This is a lie
A feeling inside
I still often drift when I drive
The tears they leave burns on my cheeks
Motionless mirrors with eyes staring me down
A view of a soul
The heart of a woman is cold
My conscious is weak
She making me weak
The only love I've ever known has left me alone
And I'm dying inside
The only thing left is my pride
The pain you hear in my rhyme
For happiness I'll never find
All in my mind
Hook
The voices in my head are screaming louder than my lips
All the words I should have said are slipping through my fingertips
And ever after seems so far away from me
The voices in my head are screaming louder then my lips
Bridge
I think I've finally failed at something
I honestly believe that
Cause looking at us from outside
You would think we would take better care of our hearts
I died when you did mentally
Spiritually?
I'm numb I feel nothing
Hook
The voices in my head are screaming louder than my lips
All the words I should have said are slipping through my fingertips
And ever after seems so far away from me
The voices in my head are screaming louder then my lips
”The moment that is bound to shape the future…”

I got a letter from the government, the other day
I opened and read it, they tellin’ me to dead it
It said that the message I was bringing brought destruction
I put the pen to the pad and said “Fuck them”
Here’s a land that never gave a damn
About a brother like me from the jump; they’d rather see me slump
Face down, shot five or six times
With my kid and her mama in the cop car crying, and I’m dying
Stop lying, it’s a black and white thang
Redneck ass judge would rather watch a nigga hang
Than indict what’s white, not right, fuck a news feed
Black men got the same needs as the Jews need
Who me? I demand reparation
Fuck a cowboy, I’m a native robbed of my nation
I’m an African, Black man, fucked out my language
Got me praying to a white boy God, that’s insane
And if you ask me, why they steadily harass me
I reply with that “These muthafuckas nasty”
And I’m a god yet they calling me a nigga
They scared of me, so they try to hide behind the trigger
Acting bad ass, fuck a honkey with a badge
I’m a nigga with an attitude, you can kiss my black ass
Ain’t no sense in niggas being diplomatic
Televise the revolution, let these muthafuckas have it
I’m calling up the homies, they said to come through
And I run with them niggas ain’t scared to come shoot
Take an eye for an eye, take a tooth for tooth
Do unto others as them others would do onto you
And now they saying “Make America Great”
But what America hates kept America straight
And America safe, muthafuck that flag
My people are not free, we wanna touch that bag
So quick to try to copyright what came for free
Now they blaming me, and it’s plain to see
That they mad at that, like I’m a magic act
Yeah, imagine that; muthafucka, I’m Black
Fuckin’ vultures, super quick to steal one’s culture
Trying to make it your own; caveman, go home
Over-tan, long nose, funny-looking ass Donald
Got his nerve disrespecting President Obama
If you don’t want us around then let us leave
Pay the money you’ve been owing my peoples as they were set free
That 40 acres and a mule never came
And yet we’re still outstanding—out standing in the rain
Just waiting, patient, pacing, and praying
For God to step up, and not ain’t shit shaking
I was mistaken thinking scripture coulda helped us
Following the faith of our very own oppressors
No justice, just us
Look at how the aftermath of slavery today still affects us
Our kids educated by the enemy
And they don’t know shit about their history
‘Cause they ain’t teaching that in school
Leave it up to them coons, and all that’s cool
Let the bygones be bygone
And besides, we’ve been killing off our own
Shut the fuck up, you know what?
Uncle Tom, house nigga slaves need they muthafuckin’ nuts cut
I pack steel in the hour of the chaos
If Black lives still don’t matter to you, stay out
I'm representin fo' my niggas on lock, doin time for that he-say
She-say, layin niggas down on the freeway
Believe me, they need me, cause all these mouse-ass niggas
Comin home too long before they release date
He facin twenty-five years fed time
And he ain't never seen a day in that thang, he bustin head time
Let's keep it real, I got the documents to prove
That youse a snitchin-ass nigga tryin to hide behind your music
You hit the highway, got money the fly way
You phony, youse a ho-ass nigga that's what I say
And you can quote this and niggas wanna touch you
Last album I was 'Made' this album the motherfucker so
All you niggas wanna plot against the mob
Since you wanna make it hot I'm fin' to, adjust your knob
I'm high powered

Beep beep goes the sound of my cellular
It's the life of a hustler
You know we livin in danger
And dem I treat just like strangers

Real nigga he don't talk about it he be about it, cause he a G about it
I got a problem with a nigga I go squeeze him out
And what the fuck am I gon' talk to the police about?
I'm from the streets doin the type of shit you read about
I got chrome 45's under pressure, and in the dresser
And now you're froze on the stretcher
You wanted trouble, I wouldn't settle for lesser
I'm the devil in the flesh, my pistol is my protector
See my reflection as it fades into black
When I reappear on a nigga it's a ragin attack yeah
And I solemnly swear, any problem I have
I just empty the clip and him callin {?} square
That's on my life because I represent the mob
Since you niggas want that heat I'm bouts to, turn up the knob
To high power


Bitch nigga you just a dead man walkin, one foot is inside the grave
The other one is in a closed-top coffin
You're still talkin, like you the O.G
When you was locked down though, you was low-key
Them niggas told me that they had you in the seg
And the locals you was workin with the boys in there
And even had the nerve to go and try to talk to the streets
Thinkin that they'd embrace a marked-as-police
And then you tried to sue a nigga, but it got back to a nigga
And when I see him I'mma do the nigga
So skip that funky-ass deposition fool
Since you wanna crank it up, then that's what I'm about to do
To high power
Life goes on in the streets of my hood when you die
But some cry, and gets by, while others choose to wonder why..
His life was took at such an early age
A young nigga who lived in a rage died by the gauge
He used to hustle on the street corners
His mom would always beg him to quit, but he didn't wanna
As he got older, he got even worse
Til a real nigga showed him the purpose of a hearse
A cold night in his hood, he had a tangle
The brother he was squabblin with, had broke his ankle
Laid him out in the driveway
Some people knew he wouldn't survive, but hey
I ain't the one to speak up on another's
All I can do is try to open his eyes and help the brother
He chose the wrong way and that's the route he took
Born and brought up as an angel but he died as a crook
He had a baby that he couldn't raise
And she will never see her father again, cause he's in a grave
Hey yo, let's think about it, nilla
"My daddy was a dopeman, so I'mma be a dope dealer"
How will the family explain it?
"My daughter had a baby for a 'caine head!"
He ain't around to see her walk
Dry her eyes when she cries, pick her up when she falls
Just the thought of a kid livin fly fucks me up
When his girl has to raise a BASTARD child
It gets deeper, he used to punch her and beat her
She was loyal to his ass but accused as a cheater
She had a good deck but she picked the wrong card
Had a kid, now she's realizin life is hard
A big time dope dealer's all she wanted
Who drove a Jag or a Benz so she could flaunt it
The situation's got me guessin..
But the answer remains to be a question
He lived his life in a lie
I guess you only get a minute to pray, and a second to die
..

It was crazy how it happened
Some niggas rolled by in the Riviera cappin
All I could see was a pistol spittin rounds
And the boy was just screamin as he fell to the ground
A woman yelled - get an ambulance
But I knew he was dead, he didn't stand a chance
You shoulda seen him, he was scared
A bullet goes to his chest, and one to his head
He just laid there in silence..
And all I heard was the sirens
Paramedics pulled up..
Followed by a law man and then came a firetruck
Put his ass on the stretcher..
But if he survives, I'm willin to betcha
He'll be out for revenge
They patched him up within a week he was back at it again
Went to his brother on the Northside
Grab your shit, it's a hit, we're gonna take a long ride
Packed it up in the trunk
AK-47, M-11 and a pump
Rolled by ?? on Scott Street
School was lettin out
"Yo you ain't gonna shoot yet?" "WATCH ME!"
Opened his trunk and grabbed a shotgun..
.. he shot him
Put his tooly on the front seat
Continued his mission, as he headed down the street
The kids was just starin at each other
J.D. rolled by and smoked black's brother
Reached in his coat and grabbed a 'port
Full speed down Reed, shot his mom on the porch
On his way down Cullard
His brother was just dazed in a shock, "Why you do it?"
"Why you shot his moms Jay? Shit"
"Hehehehehe.. hah man fuck that bitch"
Went to the store to use the payphone
Called up Mack, "Aiyyo J.D. homey"
Hung it up and rolled down Dagger
Headin for the nigga he was after
By the time he arrived at the scene
Malcolm was ready for anything
He tried to sneak around the back way
Never thought of bein taken out on that day
Black boy, black coat
Stood around the corner as he passed slit his throat
He didn't fall so he fired
One to the middle of his skull, he's expired
A whole army came out
Twenty-seven niggas all strapped out of one house
That how it happens in the acre
One nigga died in the park in the paper
Shit gets deeper but why?
I guess you only get a minute to pray
And a second to die
I'm a born killer, you're face to face with Scarface
You tried to ice an ace, but that's a motherfucking waste
You snoozed, fucked up, G
And your momma shoulda warned you bout a nigga like me
Cause I don't eat and I don't sleep
Save that motherfucking flack, cause talk is cheap
And uh, since you got beef
Lets take it to the streets and I'm a bring it to your ass, chief
I'm coming from the heart son
And I don't take no shit, but I'm about to start some
Now which one a you hoes wanna jump
If you got static, then get it off your chest punk
Cause I ain't barring none
If you're feeling lucky then go ahead and getcha some
I ain't with this fucked shit
If ya ain't in trick, then get your ass in ya trunk bitch
Cause I'm about to square it off
Hit your ass in the chest with the Tec and try to tear it off
Send you back to mommy, in some plastic
And have the bitch out hunting for a casket
I'm on the for realla tilla my nilla
I'm a born killer

I'mma born killer
Born
Killer
"Don't fuck with me"

My momma did her part
But it ain't her fault that I was born without a heart
In other words I'm heartless, dude
I don't love me, how the fuck I'mma love you?
That's right, you guessed it
I'm legally insane, marked manic depressive
I'm taking all types of medication
To keep me out the mood of premeditating
Yo, the longer I'm alone it's worse
I'm having thoughts of killing me, but I'm killing you first
My psychiatrist talks but I don't listen
A victim of society fucked by the system
My whole life's been a see saw
I'm up one day, down and out on tomorrow
Right now I'm even more upset
Some shit done happened to me that I don't think I'll ever forget
You think I'd let it die, but I ain't
It ain't because I want to, its because I can't
I'mma getcha but I ain't going into it
Cause ain't nothing to it but to do it
See it ain't no sweat to me
Cause in the first place, you fucked up the minute that you stepped to me
I'm not your average dealer
I'm a born killer


Now I'm living where I can cause I'm homeless
Can't make important calls cause I'm phoneless
I ain't eating, I'm starving duke
I can't go to momma's house cause momma's starving too
Better grab that 12 gauge
Cause that's the only way a nigga's gonna get paid
I'm on my way to my old bank
They know me real good and they don't think that I'd gank
Had my gun in my trenchcoat
Now getcha ass on the floor
And don't think about pushing that panic switch
I'm getting paid and you're getting killed bitch
Take notes to the message I gave ya
Ya dying ho, and can't nothing save ya
I'm doing bad, so I'm going bad
Huh, and you never expected that from Brad
But there's a lot of things pressing me
And I ain't the nigga to let a mortician be dressing me
So I'm coming out winning
A hundred thousand in the case now I'm coming out grinning
But the shit didn't flow smooth
The security guard had to run and pull a ho move
He reached for his pistol
The 12 gauge went "BOOM" should've heard that motherfucker whistle
Hit him in his chest
Now which one of you motherfuckers in here wanna die next?
Nobody made a move
And I got away smooth
And that's how it is, nigga
I spared a couple of lives, but I'm still a born killer
Nigga don't act like he don't know who I'm talkin' bout
(Fifty-Cent piece drops on table)

It's your worst day, run and tell somebody
It's your worst day
It's your worst day, run and tell somebody
It's your worst day
What it is?, nigga!
You don't wanna get involved with this here, nigga!
Is you a bitch nigga?, you a bitch nigga!
Look at yourself and then analyze me!
This motherfucking G
It's the flossy, you got girl draws and
Girl flaws and, a braud nigga!
I peeped your whole hand when you came in
I'm a man and I hang men
Play the game to win
All mission play on ten
Scarface 'finna do it again
Mash you nigga, stash them niggas
Don't make me upstrap and blast you niggas
Once again, it's a only if you must I do it
Lock you in my scope and blast your ass through it
I'mma poet
The image and the style that you used to
Cus' you don't keep it real like you used to
A O.G., S.A., fool to the hole fa'sho
So niggas slow your motherfucking roll
'Fore I come through with the same M-11
The Feds took from me, and shoot you in yo motherfucking stomach

You a Snitch Nigga, when you rat on yo friends
Bitch Nigga, when you still be in pads with yo kin
You'z a Snitch Nigga, running when the drama go's down
You was ballin' at first what happened to the man in the south
You a Snitch Nigga, specializin' at bumpin' ya gums
Bitch Nigga, countin' on ya bricks but all I see is crumbs
Snitch Nigga, ain't you tired of running your mouth
And you can go home, 'fore the Devil run in your house

Now snitch fellas get up under my skin
That's why I don't mess with friends
Unless it's my Mac-10
I'm the king of the ghetto, Z-Ro the crooked in the flesh
Looking for head shots, cuz bitch fellas get the bullet-proof vests
What you scared for?
What happened to all the tough ass talk
The way you was bumpin', I thought you had a taste for asphalt
Look at momma's baby out here starvin' for his ass
Whippin', chiefin', with a magician then drippin' out his ass, listen
I'll be damned if I pull a rabbit out a hat
Well pull my 40 out of holster, and do this snitch fella on his back
WHOA!, look how I handled this .44
My conscience be screaming Z-Ro Murder Mo!, Murder Mo!
And these snitch fellas on "How I'm Living" try snitchin' on "BET"
But got a restraining order against "Murder I-N-C"
This how we ride, and ain't never gon' make a switch dude
Z-Ro the Crooked, I'll be damned if I be a snitch fool


It's Bun B I go back-a like "Atlanta Black Crackers"
I back-slap a, back-packer, from here to Cakalacka{Carolina's}
Wack cracka, short stopper or dope beginner
Bitch I ain't ya chicken hitter, bring the heater get you wetter(get you
Wetter)
We can flip the caliber magnum hanger
Step a bear off in his chest, you better hope I don't land one
If I cock the bitch back..aim it at your chest
It'll be piece before they even find the pieces to your vest
We relievers of ya stress..ease ya fame
Put this pistol in your mouth, you better lead them treason games
Now when ya momma warned ya about
Bun and he's insane
Kill a kid over a quarter, who just keeps plain
Now watch this kids plain, 'fore you fuckin with the triller
Z-Ro the young guerilla
And Face the born killa
(Bitch Nigga)
Bend around in the dark for dough
(Bitch Nigga)
You here the sounds you spark for the floor
Money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round

Money makes the world go round (that's true)
And money makes me do all things that I do
And hang with my homies smoke weed and drink brew
Ride down Belfort one deep and bang Screw
And money makes the world go round, (that's right)
Money makes the world go round, (that's my life)
Livin' in a mansion one day with my wife
Stack me up some papers these days one night
If wind stops blowin' these days to my sight
The winds start flowin' I'm paid, trunk tight
I gots to have paper these days in my life
I gots to have paper these days of my life
Cause money makes the world go round

Money makes the world go round

That's right
Money makes the world go round, (straight up)
Money makes the world go round
Everyday up on your life thank your God for your life
That money makes the world go round
Without a doubt
They all want to see you about a clout
They don't know, don't want to know or see what it's about
We faced with danger, do any thing for the paper
Scarred for life mentality of the street life made us
Watch out for the snakes and fakes
Out to take what's yours to make it theirs so prepare and beware
Money makes the world go round for some niggas
Money make the world kill all niggas quicker
The sckrilla, the cabbage, the cheese, the scratch, the cheddar
Whatever you call it, it's all hot

Money makes the world go round

The unfortunates is now fortunate
Cause money makes the world go round
What's up 'Face?

Money makes the world go round

Some people gots to have it, some really need it
A lot might even sacrifice their life to retrieve it
I see that money's good for me, money's good to me
Money can't buy me love but it can rent me some pussy
You get your hands on a little bit of it and before you know it
You go crazy without, do strange things for it
Although it's made of paper, it don't grow on trees
Unless you comin' up sellin' weed, while you blow on sweets
You see money makes the world go round
Makes the price of livin' go up, chances of livin' go down
You see money makes the world go round
If you ain't got it you ain't nothin' but you come up then they hound you
Cause money makes the world go round

Money makes the world go round

I take me a shit and try to gather my thoughts
Bumpin' the south/west beat, while I sip on a quart
You see my mind is on a whole lot more than just rappin'
The nigga got to do somethin, until this rap shit happen
It's been a long time, since I got my hand on some cheese
It's gettin' hectic, my daughter can't get what she needs
Shit is fucked up, you wonder why we rob and sell dope?
I go days without eatin, it ain't because I snort coke
Fool I'm broke, what's a good way to get paid these days?
Flip burgers, or lay your ass down to get sprayed
Hey man, I got to reason with ya
Nah, fuck tryin' to reason
I'm tired of strugglin' so now it's huntin' season
I hope you understand by now what I'm thinkin'
Get a bag of that dank, from the hemp and I'm steady drinkin'
Contemplatin' on what should I do
This nigga got G's, I'm talkin' about a hundred or two

Money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round
See, money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round
For my stars, money makes the world go round
(talk)
This song is about a nigga always trying to keep you down you know
Now touch that
We made something from nothing
And vowed to never tear it apart
We turned the street hustle into an art
That would quickly change life forever for us
No more riding bikes or catching the bus
We on the roll up, money to fold up
With Cognac and cooked yola
Got the neighborhood about to blow up, but hold up
I see this van sittin', this old cat in a fitted
Trying to get your little homey tore up
Yo bruh, we ain't working on this corner take your ass on, dog
Before you make me feed your ass to my hogs you fucking faggot
I know you want to catch me with this bag so you can hide me
Or with my .44 so you can 45 me
You put this shit off in our neighborhoods and sweat us
And when you finally catch us up you give us letters
A cold thing
Just when a nigga reach his goal, mayne
You hand him a case for easing out the dope game
And I'm...
**Chorus**
Watching us unfold with the times
He don't really want a nigga to climb
You'd rather separate me from my family forever
Instead of trying to keep us together
You motherfuckers would rather keep me down...
So what I rap about these streets
That don't make me be no less of a man
Than a person that do work with his hands
It's bad enough I gots to deal with all these pressures that stand
You tryin' to make me stray away from my plan
Know what I'm sayin'?
I'm from the gutter, where all we had was one another
No wheat bread to butter, from one bed to the other
All uncles and no brother
My mother's at work
My grandfather was my dad
And when he died it hurt
And as I hold back the tears my eye-wells swell
I been praying for heaven, I been living in hell
And these niggas in my age group is dead or either locked up
The bitches no better, they smoked out or knocked up
But I still love my hood, that's where it started
Ain't no hard feelings, we partners nigga, regardless
That's why you always see me coming around
Cause I could never turn my back on my town
But still I'm...
**Chorus(2x)**
Watching us unfold with the times
He don't really want a nigga to climb
You'd rather separate me from my family forever
Instead of trying to keep us together
You motherfuckers would rather keep me down...
Money never changed me
Money changed the people around
Now they plot to try to keep me down
But still I rise like yeast
Your whole conversation bout B
Fuck a nigga talking bout me, I'm a G
The realest motherfucker ever done it
You can't continue to pimp me and y'all eat from it
So fuck every soul who ever felt like I owed
Them a god damn dime, or a god damn rhyme or a god damn chance
Motherfucker you sad
You a grown ass man, holding a nigga hand
Now get out on your own, stop depending on your homes
To chuck you a bone, and stop throwing stones
And that goes for everybody thinking it's them
Fuck you, you and you
Her, him and him
Tom, Dick and Kim
All of y'all stand accused
Saying fuck to me
And I done bought your children's shoes
I'm...
**Chorus(2x)**
Watching us unfold with the times
He don't really want a nigga to climb
You'd rather separate me from my family forever
Instead of trying to keep us together
You motherfuckers would rather keep me down...
Alright, let's ride...
I spent my day right off a Holloway, broke and disgusted
Without enough money to buy food but I'm smoking so fuck it
Hit the schoolyard, no report card because I'm larger than life
Clothes smokey, eyes shining, 'cause I'm high as a kite, fuck it
High school teachers I'm a man of respect
South Acres baby gangsta, I'm demandin' respect
Fuck the school vice principal, he shife and I'm leaving
Told my mama about my dope case and my mama believed him
Now my daddy got a problem 'cause I'm home for vacation
Strong and shy with a fucked mind, let him know what they facing
Got the doctors who done studied this, but niggas with doubt
Probably take a shrink a lifetime to figure him out (Trust me)
I seen the same thing flash change violent
And motherfuckers caught in that chain remain silent
So why you figure I've be standing here shaking
Because the devils is close to taking me but I can't face him (oooooh)
My soul is controlled by the blessings of God
Still scared to walk to first ground 'cause the devil's in charge
Somebody help the lost souls find savior
'Cause I'm standing on the cut with a Tec-9 for the hoe behavior
They want to take me out the game like Rider
But you youngstas better stop and peep game because my game wider
I send this out to those who thought that they come
Cold as fuck when it came to the game and my game done
Southside south south side; southside south south side
Southside south south side; southside south south side
You know what I'm saying
It seems like every-BODY, everybody, everybody
Everybody forgotten about me..
Will I ever, ever, EVER, be free?
Huh, uh, HUH?

Just when they thought it was safe
I picked up the phone and called it a day
I bought a new car, caught a new case, fuck it
The harder I walk, the ground shall shake
Stomping, the harder I march, the ground will break
I am, groundbreakin, like an earthquake, heh-heh
Yeah, I run this shit, but I'll tackle it
You want me to break it down, I'mma fracture it
My mind is wandering, I can't find it
But ten times outta ten, my mind on the money
Bandana around my head like I know karate
And I'll wax a nigga ass like Mister Miyagi
And it ain't over 'til the fat lady sang
And that bitch got a whole lot more weight to gain
And call me by my new name
(...What is that?) "Featuring Lil Wayne"

"It seems like every-BODY, everybody, everybody
Everybody forgotten about me..
Will I ever, ever, ever, be free?
Huh, uh, HUH"
(My nigga, Featuring Lil Wayne...
Came here to fuck with me tonight, shawty)

I am as, real as they come as hard as they get
They go to talking off the wall I put a par' in they shit
I'm the o-riginal gangsta, I'll tell you how I do it
I take niggas from the jump when they step to me with that bullshit
I am a fool, bitch, a native H-Town from the south side of Houston
You're tuned to the sounds of a nigga, who don't give a fuck
Cause one way or the other
I'm gon' still get mine, play the game, motherfucker
The truth is in the building and I came tonight
And I done sold so many records, change my name to life
Cause I can breathe into the hood, make it feel my pain
And even though they try to change me, I remain the same
And even if I did have that chrome-plated grill on my shit
I come from out the motherfucking bricks
Now, never forget, where I come from, son
I'm respected in these motherfucking streets I run
I'm Face

"It seems like every-BODY, everybody, everybody
Everybody forgotten about me..
Will I ever, ever, ever, be free?
Huh, uh, HUH"
(MY, NIGGA)

It's Bun B, the nigga Mr. Swisher, and Mr. Flows
Mr. Brick, Mr. Killer Grams Nigga, Mr. 'BOWS
Mr. Slab, Mr. Candy Paint, nigga Mr. Dough
And Mr. Eighty-fo', hating ho, even yo' sister know
When I hits the do', motherfuckers drop and kiss the flo'
Light bulb flow, I glass shatter, transistors blow
I'm the shit fo' sho! Roll wit it, bitch or {?} worm
I'm hot in this heat, a head shot'll keep your perm burned
It's my turn, I earn stripes and paid dues so
Don't be surprised if I'm in a trap or own a new show
I don't dry snitch, sneak diss or even backdo'
Balla block, a short stop or drop down in Fat, ho
(What!) I don't keep it a hunnid (huh), I keep it a thousand
I'm hood, so I rep the hood, direct from the public housing
(Mayne!) I got it crunk like Obama in a 'Fesco
Nuttin less than the best, ho
Nigga, let's go it's U..

"It seems like every-BODY, everybody, everybody (muthafuckin G..)
Everybody forgotten about me.. (K, fo' LIFE!)
Will I ever, ever, ever, be free? (Long Live the Pimp!)
Huh, uh, HUH"
It's been a long time coming but now I'm back at it
Flipping the script, from balling back to gansta rap classics
You know that shit that hit the hood and upset it
If real niggas respect it, the squares gon' rep it
I done came in here to bring it to you
The uncut version of ganstarism with the nickel painted Ruger
Quick to cock it on you, spark light in your eyes
The unexpected is happening to you now nigga, surprise!
Who is it? (Face, marchin', mobbin')
You said it one more time (Face Mob)
What else? (we keep you)
Now motherfuckers lay it down
The ruler's back, cause it's too many pussies out here
Making bullshit records and ruining rap
I gotta check this whole game; niggas out here listening
To these record label bitches instead of doing they thing
I'm a real nigga, a street nigga till it's done with
And I could never let you talk me into dumb shit
Like selling out to move a few more units
Just keep me in the ghetto cause the hood stay truest
You fuck around and cross the other side of the track
Catch you a brick then realize that you can't come back
I'mma stick to the facts
Fuck it if I don't go two
The homies know that Face stay true
And though I've got more muscle, my sounds don't change
Been the same ever since I stepped in the game
Now, this is for these niggas switchin' they shit
Prostituting theyself, trying to get them a hit
Suck a dick

You a sellout nigga
Bow down nigga before they fuck around and find you face down in the river
Talk down nigga and I'mma bust you in your mouth nigga
Show 'em you a foul ass nigga
You a sellout nigga and I'mma bust you in your mouth nigga
Show 'em you a foul ass nigga

Fo sho I talk a lot of shit but you can bet that I'm the nigga
Out here backing it up, while you acting it up
I can prove you ain't as real as what you claiming to be
You the king on your block, but you ain't shit in DC
You ain't shit off in the city of Chi
You ain't shit off in the Do It or Die
They want to skin you alive
Out here talking like you carrying arms
We don't shoot at motherfuckers, we done flipped the script to carrying bombs
I can end it for niggas out here who's hard in the booth
Any city I can hit the hood cause Scar is the truth
I know so much about these streets that I can walk them asleep
You can't tell me shit about your hood, I walked on your beat
I know your whole life story, plus I've seen for myself
You got caught smoking dope, that's why they sent you to jail
Had you locked up with wet backs, only real niggas suffer set backs
90 days and I ain't goin' to respect that
And you can sniff a snitch a mile away
Fuck him in his ass and feed him dick, a pound a day


I've got niggas I was raised with who know who I am
Lil' Brad from out of South Acres, prone for scams
Never ducked the motherfucker, I was down for the dirt
Got respect from older cats cause I was down for the work
When Fondren had its Great Skate I'd roll to the club
Drunk off the bird with thumbtack holes in my glove
Stood in the corner waiting for bullshit to jump
And in the event it jumped you saw a fool get stomped
There it is, can't get this shit no realer than that
Had a super boxing game, but now I'm peeling your cap
I done been in fist fights with niggas twice my size
Got an incredible record, 27 and 5
And the 5 losses I got, I had to redeem 'em
So he had to fight me everytime I seen him
Ain't no pussy in me, I've been for real before this rap shit
I study MCs, that's how I know you hoes is plastic
So-a, shake your ass and I'mma tell 'em the truth
Fabricate your bumps and bruises homey, do what you do
Just remember who for real when they tell you they real
I survived the game of life nigga, fuck some skills
(Scarface)
Hotel, motel, deep up in a ho's tail
Pussy smellin sweeter than a half a key a dope smell
Knock that top back, told her I'd be right back
Nigga where your wife at, y'all niggas don't like that
I bring a bitch the rough shit, you be on some love shit
Kiss and hold and hug shit, she be wantin thug dick
You winin, and dinin, puttin all ya time in
I be into windin, knockin out the linen
Silk pink panties, but she can't understand me
I be buyin condoms, you be buyin candy
She love you, lust me, gansta shit, it must be
All the while you spoilin that bitch, so thinkin 'fuck me'
Hard for you to see that, cause you be on that weak rap
"Ay, can I get some roses please?", nigga where your 'G' at
A gentleman, fuck that, wearin suits, what's that?
You hit the ho she lay there, I hit the bitch she fuck back
Makin voices, noises, voices and noises (moaning)
But when she do, I send her home to you
Pussy hole swole up, everytime she roll up
(Hook - Devin)
(Nasty) I'm slippin in and out ya girl
(Nasty) Pussy all around the world
(Nasty) Stickin my dick up in and out ya girl
(So nasty) Pussy all around the world
(Devin)
Now I admit, I didn't put my prick up ya gal
She saves her pussy for you, she's just my dick sucking pal
She tells me her problem, I like to listen and learn
And I don't mind because she's always got a Swisher to burn
And a six-pack, I sit back, chill while she drives
With her skirt pulled down and her panties to the side
Wanna smoke, what's up, open up the glove compartment
Grab the Swisher, kiss her, get my lighter and spark it
Don't know how she do it nigga but when she be drivin
She be slobbin and bobbin while she's givin me noggin
And I've been, tryin to tell myself to chill
But I find myself just takin the wheel
(Hook) 2x
(Too $hort)
She followed me to the bathroom, and I ain't have to pee
I'm at the club tryin to do this little nasty freak
I met last week, you know the panties drop quick
She suck dick with two hands and a whole lotta spit
Average niggas get nervous around the bitch
Lick between her legs and run circles 'round her clit
Fall in love, she'll make your mind a wreck
When she lay on her back, and put her legs behind her neck
Sperm drinker, come in her mouth, she keeps suckin it
It's too sensitive, have a nigga sayin
'fuck this shit, bitch, can I have my dick back'
You don't wanna hit that, you don't wanna be inside that kit-cat
She's too nasty, but I like that
Pussy have you right back, fuck where your wife's at
It's hard for you to fight that
Long throat, nut-gobblin bitch with a tight cat
Gettin head in a white 'Lac, bitch
(Hook) 4x
Just waking up I gotta thank god
Fired up a square, that's how my day starts
Early mornin' buzzin' got me lookin' at life
Outside I see movin' bitches look at the lights
It's just another Saturday it seems like
Got dressed and hit the corner with my team right
Smoke it, roll it up and pass it around
Now I'm stoned and my ass is barely draggin' the ground
No sooner than you think I would've thought of
A cop walks over, never saw him
"Excuse me, mister officer man, I wasn't tryna disrespect"
And started coughin' again
Eyes red as a bandana
And one time heavy on his antenna
At his request they sent a squad car
And then they put my black ass behind bars

Oh, sittin' on this concrete couch, just waitin'
For the judge to say that I'm gon' be free today
Oh, sittin' in this concrete box, just sayin'
It's been a shitty day, can't find no other words to say
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Fingerprinted and gettin' booked in
They fed a nigga , so I took ten
Cause I'm knowing that I'll be sittin' here the whole night
Empty trunk tank, it's finna be a cold flight
I finally come up on some housin'
Old celly, so I'm bettin' me a thousand
And plus I got a bottom bunk pass
Boss came in with his punk ass
Talkin' to a nigga like it's date time
Askin' where I'm from, I'm from H-town
Niggas askin' me what I'm in for
Nosy motherfuckers want some info
I tell him, "Dog, I ain't done shit
You know these redneck crackers think they run shit."
It's lights out, I tie my mat down
Chuck it on the rack and stretch my ass out

Oh, sittin' on this concrete couch, just waitin'
For the judge to say that I'm gon' be free today
Oh, sittin' in this concrete box, just sayin'
It's been a shitty day, can't find no other words to say
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

It's court call in the halls
Strip a nigga down to his balls
Bare-butt, naked in my tennis shoes
The nighttime sergeant want an interview
They push us out like livestock
"Ain't no talkin' while I'm talkin', this is my block"
I finally get to see me a judge
I'm a black man, so she got a grudge
Old bitch full of race hate
And a nigga quick to represent the gray state
I ain't got a lawyer, I don't need one
Give me thirty days, you get three one
I ain't tryna piss in a jug, bitch
Just because I'm black, I get fucked with
Babe, if I had been a white dude
I'd have never been arrested, look at Michael
And even if I swam like a fish, though
They still would've threw me in the Crisco
And fried a nigga's ass in some hot grease
I'm just tryna get my ass out the hot seat
It's been a long time comin
But now I'm back up in this bitch to hit these niggas with this gangsta shit
I keep the strong rhymes runnin
My shit don't switch, I'm 10 years in, and ain't changed one bit
It's all about the real, nigga
I keeps it real, nigga
And won't sell out for Girbaud or Tommy Hilfiger
Fucker, I figure niggas wanna see
The side of society they don't see on TV
So when I bring the shit, I bring the shit like I seen it
And when I scream the shit, I sing the shit like I mean it
No secret, these muthafuckas figure I'm a threat
Cause I ain't fallin short to the traps the demon set
Now sweat, cause now I got my head in your books
And when I think 'cracker', my definition read 'crook'
Now look, we're livin under laws that they set
Back then we were treated like dogs and wasn't shit
And slowly but surely the shit changed
From they fault, but if you black, then you get blamed
A damn shame, that means this muthafucka's one-sided
And blacks, we get lost in the sauce because we unguided
These muthafuckas had a plan from the start
Get what they can get and rip they assholes apart
They smart

They smart, man
(Those guys...)
You niggas better watch yo ass
(..they're the bad guys)
Them bastards they smart, man
(Those guys...)
It's up to us for how long we gon' last
(..they're the bad guys)

I declare an all-out attack
Let's take our minds behind enemy lines, so we can see how the demon acts
And how he set us up for failure in the first place
And why the fuck did we just settle for a birthday
You see, I'm hip to the games that you run
Like the games you run unfair, we can get no fair one
Cause we was dealt the bad hand from the jump
And we can't deal, so we jack and get drunk
And might end up locked down or six feet
But in these streets a muthafucka gots to eat
You can't sleep, cause if you're caught sleep, you gots to pay
And just like everyone left you got your day
And these days were meant for all to keep tryin
But we can't relate, so we fall and keep dyin
Open your muthafuckin eyes who your enemy
The muthafuckas dyin or the muthafuckas killin you?


You put your crack on my table
I turn my axe on my neighbor
And my back to my Savior
You had me thinkin you were almighty
But to the Almighty you're just a man that's really all tiny
The Maker will open up our minds to see
That Heaven ain't a place here on Earth, you gots to leave
And once we leave, we stand between eternal peace and eternal pain
And you the Beast shall meet eternal flame
So let it rain, wash away up all my bad things
And put some laughter in our hearts again
Now black men, stand up, let's come together as a whole race
And don't be fed up by the old days
They try to do us like the Indians, killin us like wild beast
And show more love for the Chinese
And kept us trapped up in a small room
And made decisions on our life we accepted that left us all doomed
They sabotaged and they camouflaged
But if these niggas game to crank up some shit, then I be down to ride
These muthafuckas had a plan from the start
The only way to beat em is to think, cause they smart
They smart
Miss me? Wished me?
Well I am done now
Won't be coming back again
I'll let you run wild!
Smile for the camera
Pose for a snap shot
This will be the last tape
I'm about to cash out
Fun while it lasted
Maybe in the next life
I can be ya girlfriend
'cus i don't need an ex wife
They tell me that beauty's only skin deep
Inside empty, pissed off simply
Cause I will not apologize
For nothing I done did wrong
Bitch you done chose me, you are gonna win some
And lose some, that's just a couple thang
Fine if it works
If it don't, that's another ring
Sold to the highest bidder, my nigga
Ho had a nerve to tell a mama I hit her
Never had to, that is not true
Now I got another boo thang, that is not you!

Let us fly to the heart
It's a fight for love
? ?
I don't know, I don't know
I'm so lost, so lonely
Where she going, where she going?
It feels like I'm in pain
I'm lonely, I'm lonely

I don't wanna play the blame game
Nah, that's not me
I can pack my own bags
No use tryna stop me
I got my mind made
A spade is a spade, ma'
You took what we had
And made it bad, what's the spade now?
Relationship is gone
Ain't no heart here
Just a ice box where it was
If it's not clear
Let me make it for you
We are over, find another
Ain't no use in trying to reason
With this stupid motherfucker
I never shoulda trust her
It was dirty from the jumpstreet
You wanted the rapstar
You ain't really want me
Settle for a anybody
Shit you done was idiotic
You thought I was broke, huh?
Bitch I'm gettin plenty money
That shit is really funny
You gave me the 10 count?
You threw in the towel on me
Then brought that Benz out
You at your friends house
Booed up with some dude?
With pictures on your instagram
Smiling with it, fuck you

Let us fly to the heart
? ?
I'm so lost, so lonely
Where she going, where she going?
It feels like i'm in pain
I'm lonely, i'm lonely

Hey it's a new me
I hope you found new you
And got your shit together
I ain't mad baby, do you
There's plenty other dudes to fall in lust with
For holidays, or any other days
That you put yo trust in
You're a must win
Losing ain't a option
You don't wanna work
You wan't the finer things, stop this
You ain't no better than the next bitch begging
Can't pour piss out of them boots you put your legs in?
And even wanna fairytale wedding
Like a nigga wanna wife you
And I don't even like you
Love gone, how am i gonna write a love song?
I'm wishing you the best, but he fucked you with a glove on!
Girl gone, how nice of you to stop by
Bitch that you accused me of sleeping wit is my wife now
Let me be nice now
Here's the introducion
Misses Jordan
He's just stupid bitch that i was fucking

Let us fly to the heart
? ?
I'm so lost, so lonely
Where she going, where she going?
It feels like i'm in pain
I'm lonely, i'm lonely
Is there anybody out there...

I swear I feel so all alone, back down on my knees again
Hoping you can keep me strong, cause I can't hardly sleep tonight
I took too many sleeping pills, I drunk too many Miller Lites
And I can feel the Reaper near, so please forgive me for my sins
I am just another man, sorry for the pain that I've caused
I know you'll understand, but these demons are driving me insane
I've been going mad, probably oughta blow out my brains
Cause I'm hurting bad but I'm fighting... blast, on the other day
These problems got me using more drugs, along with the other things
I'm slowly fading into my thoughts, (come against me, bring it on!)
And I'm drifting in and out of space, and I don't believe I'm waking up
With the alcohol, demerol, drifting into another world
With the sunshine shinin, and I think I'm finna url
Momma, can ya look at me? This ain't what I used to be
Tomorrow, I'll be somebody else, cause I ain't been me
And I can't seem to shake these things, I'll put that there on every thing
The more I try to figure me out, is like the more I've changed
But my childhood was fucked up - raised rowdy by a single moms
She told me my daddy didn't give a fuck, she ain't let him do his job
Separate the family, and I don't know my next of kin
These days in these fucked up ways, who the fuck are them?
My daddy had three other kids, but I ain't never seen him so
Ain't no sense in coming around now, you ain't been here before
It's sad but I ain't feelin him, my whole life's been a fuckin maze
And when I tried to locate my siblings, they were gone away
Lost inside they other things, fucked me then, fucked me now
Quick to tell me "Show you some love" nigga show you how?
Ain't no love I'm feelin here, I ain't never felt this vile
Momma - did you really love me, or was I just a child?
Sad on the outside, I knew you seen it in my face
I wasn't really happy here, but I was forced to lead the way
Copped me a Chevrolet, drift away to the other side just to think
If I get to see Heaven, I can thank you for the ride
And thank you for my other kids and even though
They mommas won't admit that they can't make it but bad
Low on the child support - always been bad boo, tryna make me out to be
The bad guy that I really ain't, bitches quick to hassle me
Cause I don't see my kids enough, but I make the time to pick 'em up
But you find somethin to stick in my face - it ain't me fuckin up
It's bad enough, face to face, hoes who wanna catch a case
So bad they'll try to give me they baby - and what takes the cake
Is the whole ward is fucking her, daddy know where the weakness at
And you spoke lies to ya old mans eyes, how could you sleep wit that?
Jeopardizing everything, desperate, searching for larger life
Sacrificing the entire family, with no regards to Christ
Funny how people look at life - can take this shit for granted, right?
But then reality strikes, and changes things overnight
I thank the Lord for watching over me, though I'm prone to doin wrong
I repent religiously, hoping that the weak get strong
When the heat gets on {*wind blowing*}
Hoping that the weak get strong, when the heat get's on

Ya know... it's three different... stages of life...
Either, you're headed into a storm... ya in a storm...
Or ya just got out of a storm... (yeah) think about it...
*music until fade*
News clip: "I got my double-barreled shotgun, the one I call Molly
And I crawled out of the house Army-style, with the rifle cradled in both arms
Alright, I said, just hold it right there, I said 'don't move'
And I walked up on him with the shotgun
And I cocked both barrels of the shotgun on him cause I had double-oughts in it
And (Gunshot)"

We sell crack to our own out the back of our homes
We smell the musk of the dusk in the crack of the dawn
We go through episodes too, like Attack of the Clones
Work 'til we break our back and you hear the crack of the bone
Just to get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
We commute to computers
Spirits stay mute while you egos spread rumors
We're survivalists turned to consumers
Just to get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
Ask Him why some people got to live in a trailer, cuss like a sailor
I paint a picture with the pen like Norman Mailer
Mi abuela raised three daughters all by herself with no help
I think about her struggle and I find the strength in myself
These words melt in my mouth, they hot like a jail cell in the South
Before my nigga Cor' bailed me out
To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
We do or die like Bed-Stuy
Through the red sky with the window of the red eye
Let the lead fly, some G. Rap shit, Living to Let Die

This morning, I woke up
Feelin' brand new, I jumped up
Feelin' my highs and my lows
In my soul and my goals
Just to stop smokin' and stop drinkin'
I've been thinkin' I've got my reasons
Just to get by, just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by

We keepin' it gangster, say fo shizzle, fo sheezy, and stayin' crunk
It's easy to pull a breezy, smoke trees, and we stayin' drunk
Yo, I activism, attackin' the system, the Blacks and Latins in prison
Numbers have risen, they're victims lackin' the vision
Shit, and all they got is rappin' to listen to
I let them know we missin' you, the love is unconditional
Even when the condition is critical, when the livin' is miserable
Your position is pivotal, I ain't bullshittin' you
Now, why would I lie? Just to get by?
Just to get by, we get fly, the TV got us reachin' for stars
Not the ones between Venus and Mars, the ones that be readin' for parts
Some people get breast enhancements and penis enlargers
Saturday sinners, Sunday morning at the feet of the Father
They need somethin' to rely on, we get high on
All types of drug, when all you really need is love
To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
Our parents sing like John Lennon: imagine all the people watch
We rock like Paul McCartney from now until the last Beatle drop

This morning, I woke up
Feelin' brand new, I jumped up
Feelin' my highs and my lows
In my soul and my goals
Just to stop smokin' and stop drinkin'
And I've been thinkin' I've got my reasons
Just to get by, just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by

Yoyoyo, yo, yo
Some people cry, and some people try
Just to get by, for a piece of the pie
You love to eat and get high
We deceive when we lie, and we keepin' it fly
When the people decide to keep a disguise
Can't see they eyes, see the evil inside
But there's people you find
Strong or feeble in mind, I stay readin' the signs
Some people cry, and some people try
Just to get by, for a piece of the pie
You love to eat and get high
We deceive when we lie, and we keepin' it fly
When the people decide to keep a disguise
Can't see they eyes, see the evil inside
But there's people you find
Strong or feeble in mind, I stay readin' the signs
I rise as day breaks
Clouds hide the sun’s rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
It’s darkest before light
I’m gonna push through

Turbo-charged bars
Slot cars on tracks, falling off, game scars in these rap wars
Ain’t nothing band-aids won’t cover
Touring with 7D coverage
Live bands, two buses, my own cash
No budget, no major label fundings, Jets baby
We went from crawling to walking to running
You can’t say nothing, you under gag order
Hopping out of Audi’s hurting y’all with kicks, I’m the Transporter
Think about it, never mind, you ain’t gotta
I’m already on some whole other, word to yo mufuckin' self
Nobody else gon’ do it for ya, nobody else
Every now and then someone’ll offer ya help, but they ain’t doing nothing
'Til they really see you tryna do something, I ain’t bluffing
Kush puffing on you jive turkeys
Stuffing stockings with these gifts
Audible applaudables homie take a wiff

I rise as day breaks
Clouds hide the sun’s rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
It’s darkest before light
I’m gonna push through

When you a man, action is what’s expected, nothing is spoken on
Producer never got time for no excuses, gotta go beyond
My flow is tom-foolery
I smoke these pork rappers so fast they call me charcuterie
I beautifully exude the vibe that’s free of ambiguity
Ya goonery for the sake of goonery is cartoons to me
It’s coonery, it’s lunacy, let’s make it plain
Only way that you hang is attached to a tree
The moon talk to the sea and speak the body language fluently
She makes it rain
When I’m on fire, she always try to douse me
Only reason that you make it rain is ‘cause your diamonds cloudy
I see you from a mile away when it get overcast
Old people feel it in they bones, invade your home like I broke the glass
And let myself in, fighting for freedom like the people in Tunisia
Spread through Sudan and Egypt, this the music for the movement
The score to your achievements, never join ‘em so you gotta beat ‘em
It’s carpe diem hey (hey) yeah

I rise as day breaks
Clouds hide the sun’s rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
It’s darkest before light
I’m gonna push through

Like kindergarteners
My vision’s bothered by vigilantes that harbor on street corners
Try your hardest to harvest bundles of weed on ya
The starving’ll speed on ya, stampede on ya
Impede on your pockets then pee on ya
Dreams of us living lavish in fabrics of fine linens
Spending, established, with women dining and laughing
But this environment got us violent, ready to crash in–
–to society, take this driver seat, hope you fastened
Your seatbelts twice, when I rolled them dice, I crapped
So many times I can build casinos from scratch
Too many daps you might receive from the things you achieve, relax
That’s what my mental say, but my physical’s been detached
I’m on some other shit, like fuck the government
I'm higher rankings, where’s the mothership?
I made a covenant that I was changing but my luck has been
Quite disgusting when reality tainted, where the fuck you been?
Left him face down like he was planking
In a cold world where old girl and her homeboy got a motive
You can bench curl your tribulations, that sensation's insulting
Got a wifey or a mistress, nigga which one you indulging?
Regardless of who you pick know life's a bitch when you ain't focused nigga
I'm focused

I rise as day breaks
Clouds hide the sun’s rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
It’s darkest before light
I’m gonna push through
Another night, slips away
In other words, I should say
There are no words, you should say
There are no words
Another night, slips away
In other words, I should say
There are no words, you should say
There are no words
Ms. Hill, you got skills, that's a gift, it's real
Get ill, what you spit got the power to uplift the heel

I wish I could talk to Lauryn
I mean excuse me, Ms. Hill
And let her know how much we love her is real
The industry was beating her up
Then those demons started eating her up
She need a savior that'll bleed in a cup, yup
We used to kick it in the salad days
When she look at me like she ain't know me when she see me nowadays
I nod, she nod back, that's how it stay
Her songs still better than anything out than "Hot" or "Power" play
Remember how they accused her of saying, he did her album without help
Then she went to Rome to sing and tell the Pope about herself
Just after she left the Fugees, started rolling with the Marleys
Got back with her crew at Dave Chapelle's Block Party
She made songs about Zion and trying to be faithful
Took Black Star on tour in Europe, I was so grateful
Speaking for myself but I'm sure I could speak for Dante
I got to watch a show with Nina Simone and Harry Belafonte
We used to chill at Nkiru, her moms was a customer
She used to love to buy the books by Octavia Butler
Parable of the Sower, the main character's name was Lauren
What the album did for black girls' self-esteem was so important
I got concerned when she got sick on the road
She ain't healthy,, I'm a brother
And I wish that I could pick up the load, but no


Got your assistant on the the phone, "I need to talk to Lauryn"
And I wanna walk through the storm, and I could be the umbrella when the rain is pouring
Please, this no disrespect to whoever your man is, though
This relationship is strictly music like D'Angelo
I know you hate Babylon, and wanna see it fall
But they won't let you read your poem at the BET awards
You give us hope, you give us faith, you the one
They don't like what you got to say
But still they beg you to come, whoa
Now that's powerful sis, it's black power
We get money, keep our eyes on the final hour
And no I ain't saying you Christ, that would be sacrilegious right?
But you can blow and you nice, sisters them raps is vicious
The raps the sisters recite with their black fist up
The devil's last wish is a queen that rise past bitches
We used to read Francis Crest or anything
By Third World Press impressed
But what the power of the word suggest
Hatched ideas in our heads like birds in the nest
You gave birth to a new sound like Donda West, yes
Should I be saying all of this while the mic is on?
I might as well let it out because one day I might be gone
I write this song and hope you feel how much we love you
And you play it, cause I really ain't got the words to say it
But yo
History, it's happenin' every day, y'all (right now)
Everyday (live, right now)
Right now (good mornin', Vietnam!)

Listen! Brooklyn wins again
It's the Stuy, it's the Bush, them niggas again
Ta' Kweli, Mighty Def, and S. Dot on the guest lock
Kanye, you're the dopeman of hip-hop, now let's rock
Now roll out, niggas, my hometown niggas
I get it good in yo hood, so slow down, niggas
Watch the speed though, mind your pedal and ease off
Or screech off into a collision course with these walls
(BAM!) They don't move, don't pray, don't lose
Don't sleep, life passin', light flashin', life happens
That fast, part of done, black hands up in prayer
Black guns up in fear, dyin' wish is to touch the air
Seekin' heaven that wasn't here
Eyes will not see another year, it's another day
It's the same fight, different round, sound the bell
Mix it up in victory, you live it up, the beat'll get risen up
You're knocked down, then get back and get it up
Get off of queer street and get with us
And get clear where we did it, from the heart, from the people
From the top, from the jeep, from the gut, from the street
From my soul to the mic to the essence
So in my absence you feel the presence, exactly
I make contact, for short, I MC
Me and mine we don't just get by
We get free and that's ready 

Just to get by
Nigga I sold coke, nigga I pushed lah, carried a fo' five
Claimed I was ready to die, promised never to cry
Held it all inside, reality was too much to take, so I
Kept my mind fried, slept for most of mine
Soon as I closed my eyes, then I woke up behind
Thinkin' either I load up these 9's, or blow up with rhymes
‘Cause this flow of mine is like blow up but lines of coca
And your folks think Hov' just wrote stuff to rhyme
Nah, I'm a poster for what happened seein' your moms
Doin' five dollars worth of work just to get a dime
So pardon my disposition
Why should I listen to a system that never listened to me?
Picture me workin' McDonald's! I'd rather pull a MAC on you
Sorry, Ms. Jackson, but I'm packin', bye!

Yeah! It's somethin' about that Nina Simone piano flow
It's like a Michelangelo painted a portrait of Maya Angelou
And gave it to a sick poet for they antidote
If music get ya choked up, this is the tree and the rope
This is Chi, nigga, I'm Mr. All-of-That
Fuck a map, let's put this bitch on the almanac
Dice what they hittin' fo', lax what you sittin' on
Tracks who you spittin' on, rap 'til we get it on
And don't let nobody with the power to sign
Ever tell you you ain't got the power to rhyme
They used to tell me, "Toughen up, put some bass in your voice!"
They used to tell me, "Lighten up, put some Mase in your voice!"
Lord willin' I ain't killed nobody
But I have a feelin' this album that I'm gonna make a killin'
Or not a shilling, this is love-it-or-hate-it music
But—at least we made it music
And we didn't make it industry, this is gon' be interesting
This'll be the end of me, or I'm finna be an entity
Kanye, Jay-Z, Mos Def, and Kweli
We are not makin' songs no more, we're makin' history

This morning I woke up
Feelin brand new, I jumped up
Feelin my highs and my lows
In my soul, and my goals
Just to stop smokin' and stop drinkin'
But I been thinkin' I got my reasons
Just to get (by), just to get (by)
Just to get (by), just to get (get buh buh buh bye bye)
(Just to get by, just to get by)
(Just to get by), just to get get buh buh buh bye bye

We keep it gangsta, say 'fo shizzle', 'fo sheezy'
Desensitized by the violence on the TV during the war
Killin' each other is easy, its pourin' liquor for fallen niggas
Believe me, it's ghetto libation, seen it all before
Just to get by, my people, we get fly
My people, we get high, fillin' cigars with the lah
Nigga, come on! Even Jesus was stoned
Before receivin' the throne
I send a rest in peace to Nina Simone

Back in the days we was used to doin' the shit
I can't call it all in the streets
We was hustlin' fiends that asked for it
I guess I was used to just standin' on corners
Waitin' for paper bags with bundles of crack
Hopin' the week was good, so I could get money back
(To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by)
When I was stressed I possessed a side of my strength
That made me angry and bleed
With the frustration havin' me smokin' Newports and weed
(To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by)
Those be the times when I try to rely
On my niggas and street mothafuckas
And reach out to wifey, and then I place a call on my mother
(To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by)
*Ayo, Mom, pick up the phone, I gotta to talk to you, Ma*
If you was five percent instead of actin' stupid and guessin'
You had to go and study your lessons
And know your math in the building in session

This morning I woke up
Feelin brand new, I jumped up
Feelin my highs and my lows
In my soul, and my goals
Just to stop smokin' and stop drinkin'
But I been thinkin' I got my reasons
Just to get (by), just to get (by)
Just to get (by), just to get (get buh buh buh bye bye)

Some people try, some people try
Just to get by, for my piece of the pie
We love to eat and get high
We deceive when we lie
And we keepin' it fly – yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
When people decice to keep a disguise
Can't see your eyes, see the evil inside
The best people you find
Stronger people in mind
I stay readin' the signs
I don't wanna waste your time baby
I just wanna make you come to me
Comfortable baby, so come here darling
And come for me baby
I don't wanna waste a second, no girl
I just wanna make you come dance with me
Come talk to me, come here darling
Come here for me baby

Why you so far away? You need to feel this
I've got somethin' to tell you, come here real quick
I've done dirt in the past, I know that love hurts
I'll come for you, but my lady's got to come first
I can tell by your hesitation there's trust issues
You get excited, ignite it, highly combustible
You on a higher vibration, that's why I fuck with you
Left me provide for you, comfortable as a Huxtable
Your whole style is colder than Minnesota
I love your profile, the way you look over shoulders
At the crib, I'm hopin' you come over
We can do it like Common and Mary and come closer
We can do it like Barack and Michelle, give me a fist bump
Black magical, act radical with the fist up
Do it 'til we rockin' the bells, you like hip-hop
Promise you I'm not gonna tell, we keep our lips locked

I don't wanna waste your time baby
I just wanna make you come to me
Comfortable baby, so come here darling
And come for me baby
I don't wanna waste a second, no girl
I just wanna make you come dance with me
Come talk to me, come here darling
Come here for me baby

Like a Spike Lee movie, I'm movin' across the floor
Feelin' love in the music, I'm using it like a lure
I love how you do, with your beauty and your allure
Make you come like the ocean, approaching me like "sure"
She Rockefeller Center like Diego in the lobby
As valuable as The Scream or a Salvador Dali
She popular with the thieves and wanna be Thomas Crown
Some try to steal her attention as soon as I'm not around
This last bird probably flew the coop
Blastin' Outkast, last words: "Ooh-Dee-Whoo"
I don't know how to describe you, you're so beautiful
Je ne sais quoi... how you say, "voulez vous?"
Pardon my French, with the tongue kissin' I'll make her come hither
'Til she dancin' with wolves, see how they run with her
I'm dumb twisted off rum, liquor
But fix my composition and give a proposition to consider

I don't wanna waste your time baby
I just wanna make you come to me
Comfortable baby, so come here darling
And come for me baby
I don't wanna waste a second, no girl
I just wanna make you come dance with me
Come talk to me, come here darling
Come here for me baby

Hey you, hey you, hey you
Yeah, I'm talkin' to you
Hey you, hey you, hey you
Yeah, I'm talkin' to you
Simmer down for me
Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down for me
Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down for me
Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down for me

Black Madonna, you sow the seeds like a farmer
While I manage, just serving long sentences, no commas
Write poetry in your honor, your body is like a sauna
The promise, you gettin' closer to the sun, you gettin' hotter
You the Earth, that's emphatically "yes"
But I still call you a bad bitch, under my breath, out of respect
Naturally blessed, Lady Chatterly fresh with tatted flesh
I ain't gotta ask her "why you stare" - that's a "yes"

I don't wanna waste your time baby
I just wanna make you come to me
Comfortable baby, so come here darling
And come for me baby
I don't wanna waste a second, no girl
I just wanna make you come dance with me
Come talk to me, come here darling
Come here for me baby
I know there's a first time for everything
First time I let her in my bed she got wetter then the perfect storm
That we weathering together and
This the first time that I've ever considered wedding rings
But first things first yo
I met her at the bar rolling with three wise men like I followed the star
There she is shorty bi coastal
Thick like bifocals, stacked like 2Pac vocals her body so loco
Jewel of the Nile so I'm romancing the stone
The rhythm is to the words and I watched her dance to my poems
The way she move them hips let me know in advance that she grown
I pictured it like Paris Hilton when she answered the phone, yo
Dancing alone because she extra fly
But I got good look so I catch her eye
Gave the rest a try now give the best a try
Leave your nest and I'll fly make you testify
Damn baby I know we got some haters and

I don't care what people say
As long as you and me okay
Because I never been in love before
See I use to be a player and
All of this is new to me
And this ain't what I'm used to seeing
Because I never been in love before

You running back to the kid like this was home base
Or a marathon I let you set your own pace
Your own space and the beautiful struggle
Now baby tell what's it gonna take to prove that I love you
When I'm gone you be missing me too
It let me know that my prayers is the music God be listening to
Don't get it confused I'm trying to get religious with you
I never thought I feel like this its like a miracle you
You You stole my heart like a crook in love
Crossing the bridge to the Brooklyn love
When I took above it's clear skies that's surrounding my earth
Your love is drugs and I'm down to serve let's deal with it yo
We go to the spot and you still get it low
I get excited fast and still love to hit it slow
Till the walls come tumbling down like Jericho
And you hear the sound is stereo
Here we go


You looked good when I tried you on
So I had to write a song
Use to be the guy that always made her cry when I'm gone
Always kept a stable and I never spent a night alone
No cable or no hard line phone why
I'm never home scared of commitment
Ready to forever roam
We at war like sister souljah and she welcome to my terror dome
Head strong our connection proved them haters dead wrong
From now to R.I.P. Proceeds my name up on the headstone
Leave her be for five minutes
Dudes try to dive in it first
They want to spit on my name and tarnish my image
I tell them do you I don't care who she speaking with
Because I already know she made it clear who she leaving with
And it feels so beautiful
Put it in a rhyme because it feel so musical
Plus you ain't no groupie ho
Sitting in the studio
Before we do this though there something that you should know
Ayo Fed wassup bro?
Wassup with me? You know what's up with me man
I'm trying to get paid in full
Check this out right
Since Javotti is the label
And I'm talking over this def beat right here
I think we should turn it up
We got my man (Tr-tr-Trend on the beat)

Thinking of the master plan
Where there’s nothing but cash inside my hand
Wanna dig into my pocket my prophet is heaven sent
I dig deeper, you know I represent, represent
Yeah, money over bitches, my sisters go over everything
My bandz will make you dance, I'm forever like a wedding ring
Far above the hate and, the jealousy that the cheddar bring
Trying to get away from the 85ers like Evelyn
Ride with me, I got ‘em leaking like Nene
Got ‘em leaking like Wiki, these monkeys biting like hickeys
Cause they’re seeing what I’m doing, filling them with confusion
Cutting just like a truant, I’m fluent just like a student
Of the romance languages, only the diamonds hang with us
My meal is decorated with garnishes just like your wages is
The crib’s outrageous like really it's no joke
The girl of your dreams be coming over to smoke loud

Turn it up loud, turn it up loud
Turn it up loud, turn it up loud
Drop it, stop it
With all the soap operas and the soap boxes
Turnt up, turnt up, turnt up, for the people

You can feel the heat from your speaker, my sound will darken your features
Run it down like a zebra, I move with the speed of cheetahs
I’m from Brooklyn where the heat is the size of a two-litre
I ain’t asking for no followers, I'm looking for new leaders
Is hard not consuming all the bullshit they feed us
Intravenous like a cord to the womb from the fetus
Been hard since I started reading, alliteration is literally littered
Through my DNA swimming all through my semen
So every time I bust, babies begin being born
Talk turns tough til them toasters that's tucked get
Drawn like a picture, picture a perfect painting
Police profiling people peacefully praying
Lay the law like leaders the lazy is lollygagging
On my grind getting guap, guess green is the new black
Meet me at the bar, we throwing a few back
Hopped out the car, you know who blew that loud


Ayo we drink good, smoke good
These cats wearing funny hats like the pope would
I come in looking quite clean in the loafers
So hood might scheme up to no good
You no crook, Gosling in the Notebook
I got the birds on the wire like I know I Wood
I still rep P.O.C.s like I'm supposed to
Coming live from death row like I know Suge
My rhymes like a laser beam - so focused
I’m in the ring, so lean I need a foam cup
I ain't lying, bare teeth so ferocious
Maybe I’m lying bare feet in the ocean
On the beach fall asleep and I'm floating
To the beat so unique like a potion
I love music, I’m complete in my devotion
(Word, say it again)
I’m complete in my devotion
I'm on that homicide, suicide, drama like Islamabad
Under God, going overboard like the Amistad
Ringing bells, it was 2012 back in 95
I made it out alive, now finally I've arrived
But still threw back to all my other blue black
People that's sticking to it like, mice to a glue trap
My work speak for itself so I don't interrupt
I am an expert, this is no beginners luck
If you denying the truth, then I don't give a fuck
Otherwise get your hands and your antennas up
As we go into our initial descent, I'm alive, but only fifty percent
I wasn't listening to that intuition now I'm in that system again
And I'm praying God give me the strength
I'm drifting into a dark place, tryna keep this part of my heart safe
My soul basically been shark bait, my body's in bad shape

Spitting that fire flame, on a higher plane, going poltergeist
Life a game, ain't no referee, I can't hold it right
Bring the rain, praying to the Lord for it to pour tonight
Bring the pain, fucking with that meth, I'm on that Walter White
There ain't no maybes, baby, make it or you don't make it
You gotta take it, take it, take it or you gon' get taken
Can I get a church from the congregation?
Can I get a church from the congregation?

I'm on that armageddon, public devastation, come in the Revelations
Rap Jehovah, knocking pastors over while I pass the dosha
Lord forgive him, but I keep cutting these records like a sword was with 'em
Mixing it with the medicine, attempting to warn the children
Of what the future holds, slaves of monatomic gold
Seems the problem is atomic, but it's microscopic though
I'm courting hoes and pouring fours, there must be something more than this
Hopefully I'm immortal and I'll never need a mortician
All my thoughts is black, Kweli on the track
My reflection is eternal even if the mirror cracks
And I don't wear no watch, cause I ain't got no time
Solar system, this is astronomy not a rhyme
We bringing the real back, y'all ain't have no spine
So spin the reel back, nigga press rewind
Soak it all in, that is until you're dry
I'm throwing the peace and eating a piece of devil's pie, I'm...


A dialectic
Attract cofollowings like scientologists reading the dianetics
This religion that I invented, it's really a way of life
These thoughts of freedom that I embedded is reaching you through the speakers
These poison animal leaders is weaker than niggas with fever and sweeter than diabetics
Get deaded trying to set it, they'll tie you up like a fetish
They'll gas you up like unleaded and let it off
'Til you wetter than spaghetti sauce and lettuce chopped up with your body left in a crevice
We the reverends performing exorcisms
Exercising the right to fight for the dedicated
Concentrated few that's left who listen
God is with them like we started a mission, following God is wisdom
God is risen like followers of Elijah finding God in prison
We praying for that work, we need that occupation
Can I get a church from the congregation
If you sick of the same conversation
You say you make it rain but that's just condensation
My mama said life would be so hard
Growing up days as a Black girl scarred
In every way, still; you've come so far
They just know the name they don't know the pain
So please hold your heads up high
Don't be ashamed of yourself know I
Will carry it forth til the day I die
They just know the name they don't know the pain, Black girl

I do it for the people, I do it for the love
I do it for the poet, I do it for the thug
This is for victory, and this is for the slaughter
I do it for my mother, I do it for my daughter
Promise I'll always love ya, I love to kiss and hug ya
You and your brother should be looking out for one another
I'm so blessed, man, y'all the reason I got up
Somebody put his hands on you I'm getting locked up
I'm not playing, that's the prayer I'm saying for Diani
And if I die then she'll be protected by Amani
That's her bigger brother and I love the way he love her
She a girly-girl, she love to imitate her mother
But she a Gemini, so stay on her friendly side
She'll put that look on you, it's like somebody friend just died
My pretty Black princess smell sweet like that incense
That you buy at the bookstore supporting Black business
Teach her what black is; the fact is her parents are thorough
She four reading Cornrows by Camille Yarborough
I keep her hair braided, bought her a black Barbie
I keep her mind free; she ain't no black zombie
This is for Aisha, this is for Kashera
This is for Khadijah, scared to look up in the mirror
I see the picture clearer through the stain on the frame
She got a Black girl name, she living Black girl pain
This is for Makeba, and for my Mamacita
What's really good Ma, I'll be your promise-keeper
I see the picture clearer through the stain on the frame
She got a black girl name, she live in black girl pain


This is for Beatrice Bertha Benjamin who gave birth to Tsidi Azeeda
For Lavender Hill, for Khayelitsha
Athlone Mitchell's Plain, Swazi girls I'm repping for thee
Manenberg, Gugulethu; where you'd just be blessed to get through
For beauty shining through like the sun at the highest noon
From the top of the cable car at Table Mountain; I am you
Girls with the skyest blue of eyes and the darkest skin
For Cape Coloured for realizing we're African
For all my cousins back home, the strength of Mommy's backbone
The length of which she went for raising, sacrificing her own
The pain of not reflecting the range of our complexions
For rubber pellet scars on Auntie Elna's back, I march
Fist raised, caramel shining, in all our glory
For Mauritius, St. Helena; my blood is a million stories
Winnie for Joan and for Eadie, for Norma, Leslie, Ndidi
For Auntie Betty, for Melanie; all the same family
Fiona, Jo Burg, complex of mixed girls
For surviving through every lie they put into us now
This worlds yours', and I swear I will stand focused
Black girls, raise up your hands; the world should clap for us

Momma said they'll be days like this...
From the top, from the top, from the top, from the top
From the top, from the top, from the top, from the top
In a state of grace
Where the talent is surrounded by the pain and the violence
So the selling never safe
At the same time snitching to the Jake
Is the quickest way to get found at the bottom of a lake
But the problem we face seems so great
That we can't escape so we accept our fate
So the sex and the money and the murder are the pictures we paint
If an artist is a part of a community
And got an opportunity to get that cake
Would never come back to the hood, no immunity
Usually a nigga like that so fake,no different from a snake
Nothing left to give cause you always wanna take
If you ain't using all the talents God provided you with
For the betterment of man, understand you ain't nothing but a waste
Look into the face of a young girl
Raising up like a flag when it's unfurled
Got game listening to her mother's pearls
And she love Beyonce cause she run the world
Her mama used to run this city
Way back before the nigga Puff was Diddy
When it came to the music then she got real picky
From New York, but preferred 2Pac over Biggie
No disrespect to Ms. Wallace, but she liked to do the knowledge
And she felt that Pac was more lyrical
Plus she never went to college
But she called herself 'Earth' found rhythm with the gods more spiritual
She God in the physical
And it's only natural to pray for a little you
Musical so she played the umbilical chords
So her daughter was born it was a miracle
Music is the light when it's dark
And the way that you spit your dart is a big part
She grew up loving hip hop
Now all her daughter got is "Love & Hip Hop"
Nowadays niggas turn up for the sex
Niggas turn up for the money, never turn up for the movement
Ratchet reality stars that be looking so stupid
Getting in the fights at reunions
She used to be inspired by the writers, now she's tired of the biters
No desire for the lying and the violence
That's inflicted on the body in a so-called party environment
Her body is politics
Lost count of how many whores she was called today
She won't do it no more, lost all her faith
They say she exaggerate when she hollerate
But it's only so much she can tolerate

Help me find my way to a state of grace
Stir my heart, touch my soul
Feed me freedom sounds you made
Help me find my way to a state of grace
Lift me up with your weight
Pull me to the grace

She wanna to be the first in her family with a higher education
Her entire graduation was a dire situation
Did a paper on the state of the hip hop generation
But no longer felt a part of the conversation
Used to be I'm a ''ride or die'' chick
B.I.G. with the ''Me And My Bitch''
No objections, being an object,major label seeing a profit
She ain't never been a bitch or a ho
But she used to sing along when she heard it in a song
She used to be front row at the shows 'til she overdosed on the testosterone
Her favorite rapper invited her backstage would have stayed
But she felt like she really ain't belong
When she wouldn't let him hit, this nigga called her a bitch
She erased all her songs from the phone
You are who you fuck with, so the guy that she stuck with
You can bump it or dump it, the artist she trusted
Just broke her heart, so misogynistic and disgusting
She tried not to judge him, in her heart she still loved him
And the way that he lusting, a part of his suffering
And this young man, clearly not ready for the harder discussion
Female emcees acting more like a dude than a dude do, only if you knew
I know a few who flow crazier than if you flew over the nest of the cuckoo
But she never gonna hear them in the mix so the new attitude
Taking cues from the radio playing that doodoo
She on D'Angelo Pandora station playing that Voodoo, who knew?


In the face of hate
She'd be lucky for a balance cause the world is challenging her to be great
I see lyrics as colors and shapes
Put it on tape, let her know I could relate
When you wish you could switch the way that you look
And your nose was smaller and your hair was straight
When you got no faith
When you hate yourself, when you hate your race
Let's get to the core
Our sisters worth more than grinding on the wall half-naked
She a bitch, she a whore
And you rich and you shit on the poor
In all of your records and ask 'em to buy it
Why should I support music that constantly disrespects me?
And make you dismissive of the efforts of those who get left
With the charge of repping it correctly
When it's free online or in a cloud
Ain't no reason to touch the radio dial
You wonder why you don't hear no sounds on the air
And it's clear that your sales going down
Down by law then you found the raw
On a message board and you sounding off
These niggas get the whole world, but what's the cause?
No wonder why these niggas be sounding lost
Rhyming is a memory
The assembly line rap niggas is designed by the enemy
Stop giving them your soul, gift wrap
Prepackaged, fabricated shit rap
Running through you like fast food -  Big Mac's
You don't want no problems, fix that
All the time that you spent listening to that bullshit
Now you ain't never gon' get back


She don't love it, no
She don't love it no more
I exhibit characteristics of the average misfit
Who graduated from stabbing and grabbing a biscuit
It’s sick and tragic how antagonistic we get
When there's no power it go sour
I seen 'em crossing a bridge by the masses,
Covered in the ashes of both towers
Native New Yorker the way that we talk
Make him an offer that you can't refuse
Come back later on after you thought it over
Look out for shooters that we’re popping up at the opera
To pop ya, daughters paying for the sins of the god father
Popular music got ‘em confusing killers and artists
I kill it the hardest. Competition dearly departed
They feeling some sort of way 'cuz my flow revealing the garbage
I'm making 'em throw it up. You just making the people vomit
When it comes to this rhymin' I’m a legend like Tutankhamun,
Or the Chupacabra, the way I weave it together and tie the knot up
Made a macramé of macabre, you daquiri with a shot of
The Amarretta, you’re sweet as a girly drink
Throw it back, cognac, I'm the best, you know that
You can have your own opinion, but not your own facts
On track as the most prolific ever, the most consistently
Viciously off the rip, we be rippin' it like a shredder
Some symphony hall shit, gettin' higher than your falsetto,
Getting better. Drop a pearl every jam like Eddie Vedder
Very fed up with self appointed preservers of past eras
Who never see their reflection when they’re walking past mirrors
They got bitten and now they smitten with the taste of blood
They take enough drugs for the sleepin' they weepin' and fuckin' they make-up up
I raise the bar and the waiters up
All this hate is just confused unadulterated love
The eyes are the window to the souls and my shades is up
Advocate for artists, regardless cause I got faith in us
For the workers who don’t get paid enough
Take the bus, hands way too rough for the paper cuts
As far as they’re concerned food on the table's the only way to love
It takes a slum village to raise a child, you got to raise it up
Raise it up, raise it up,raise it up, take it up, take it up
Yes! Welcome to the wonderful sounds of Talib Kweli
Ladies...

I got you in the mood, for an interlude
Raw like in the nude, I hope this ain't considered rude
But let's stop talkin, cause it's feelin like an interview
I know you into me, so, let me get into you
I'm always in the mood for laughin and lovin
And rappin and fuckin', and passin' the dutch and relaxin'
And puffin' and hittin' and duckin', the rippin production
These kittens ain't muffins, just because we stuff 'em in the oven
My words is drippin off the tongue like the wax from a candle wick
Ill the way I lay down the rap, they can't handle it
Cats all sappy like romantic flicks, dude, get a clue
Like Colonel Mustard in the study with a candlestick
They holdin hands with these dudes like they goin steady, but
One glimpse and I know they're ready, you already know
Slipped her a note like, 'you ready to go?'
We make a getaway plan and we head for the do'!

I wear the night like a cloak cause I move with the stars
Navigate through the truly bizarre
Who we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life
And if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight
I wear the night like a cloak cause I move with the stars (uh, uh)
Navigate through the truly bizarre (Yeezy, uh-uh)
Who we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life
And if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight (Woo!)

You messin up my mo', my whole mood, told you, oh
Lose, eat crews like crews like soul food
The only producer that feel like "fuck rappers!"
Only backpacker with a chip like hackers
Only Michael Richardson, only much blacker
So if he say nigga, then I'ma say...
Is this a Ritz? Carlton? Dress like, fresh, like
Just like, I'm the shit
Uh, you ain't figured out what I'm about yet
Always rockin that "this ain't out yet," but this ain't 'bout that
From a city where niggas plug like outlets
Far as music go, yo, it ain't no outlets, so, when I go out
Niggas always out to get me in the studio
And I ain't in the mood to flow, I'm with my girl
And I'm tryin to hit the movies yo, and they tryna act stupid, oh!
In the club with Silicone Suzie
What happened to real girls like Rudy?
With real titties like Tootie
This girl got a silicon booty!
And got the nerve to act moody!
Now I ain't tryin to judge like Judy
But bitch you a man, you can't fool me!
Act like 50, throw her in a pool, G!


Break it down, uh!
What?
Ah-ah, uh, uh-uh, ah
Ah-ah, uh, uh-uh, ah
Yeah!

Bringin the drum, keep it funky like a stink in a slum
Cause see they wanna breed cursin for the things that don't come
The speakers wrong that we rap dudes speakin in tongues
Christmas time choice for what? No we keepin our guns
Smokin a piff to cause a leak in your lungs
You ain't got shit to do like Friday when the weekend begun
Completely done with rap dudes, don't compete with the dumb
I spill my blood for my people, see how deep it can run?
I'm in the mood like Donte and Main Flow
Never comin with the same flow, got it's change, yo
It's strange yo, to make yo chain glow, that's yo main goal
That's a facade like I'm somewhere over the rainbow
Really these cats sweeter than mangoes, Mr Bojangles-ass dudes
Dancin around the club, doin the tango
Go hard like Iverson playin with hurt ankles
Plus, wrestle the topic from a different Kurt Angle!


Wow, that's a nice track!
(We must love and support each other!)
We have nothing to lose but our chains
(We have nothing to lose but our chains!)
Now you say that shit so loud, them motherfuckers outside hear you
It is our duty to fight for our freedom!
(It is our duty to fight for our freedom!)
It is our duty to win (It is our duty to win!)
We must love and support each other
(We must love and support each other!)
We have nothing to lose (We have nothing to lose!)
We have nothing to lose (We have nothing to lose!)
We have nothing to lose (We have nothing to lose!)
But our chains (But our chains!)

Send this one out to
To the mothers (they neglected) to the fathers (they rejected)
To the sisters (disrespected) to the brothers (unprotected)
All of us (all of us) all of us (all of us) {all of us}
We send this one out to
To the mothers (they deceited) to the fathers (they mistreated)
To the sisters (they misleaded) to the brothers (that get beated)
All of us (all of us) all of us (all of us) {all of us}
This is happening to all of us

Yeah, if our struggle is a strain then the strain is dominant
My name is prominent for entertainment that's laced with consciousness
But really it's just common sense like Lonnie Lynn
You don't need binoculars to see the light coming through the dome like it's an oculus
The common myth that we're savages with no history or accomplishments
Or knowledge of ourselves, they did a job on us
Considering the prediction of economists, machines will do our jobs for us
The future for the working class is ominous
They got us indoctrinated through a bitch's brew, a religion mixed in with abuse
Emotional we sit in pews, it's physical, we get the noose
And hang ourselves refusing to name ourselves, refuse to change ourselves
When I talk about our past it doesn't ring a bell
They make you hate yourself it take effort so check the method
They'll take you from your family, your kids will never respect ya
Attach your sins to the black of skin we get the message
We start acting if we cracking the whip better than the oppressor, yes
Every problem can't be solved at the ballot box
We unifying Africa like Gaddafi, that's what got Malcolm shot
They out to stop anybody with knowledge that figured out the plot
On the balcony like Martin Luther King, I been to the mountaintop
The blue wall of silence, it's really the blue wall of violence
The good cops who retire and get fired
They screaming black on black as an excuse for you to not care
'Til the cops roll up in their SWAT gear

I tarried through the turbulent month of Ramadan
Sweating all through the night just like the Holy Prophet
Then reappeared on the stage in BK with the Ummah
Shoulder to shoulder with J. Cole and Kweli
Just before Jehovah the God crowned me the king with his goldie locket
Alhamdulillah, we've come really far, ain't it?
The little engine who could, could power any car can't it?
The mothers in Chiraq say the murders getting burdensome
The cries of the despised was heard flying out of Ferguson
The last days and times, the holy Quran and Bible
We on the last page and line, the verse with all the babies dying
Outside of the matrix, inside of the spaceship but the savior's blind
Or so it seems, years after Noah was told he would row upstream
The heavens bursted and the rains came
Retaliation for the sons of the fathers who worked the chain gangs
I hit that shmoney dance on the coffin of a crooked cop
In a Worldstar society where all we do is look and watch
No intervention
Policemen beating elderly women with evil intentions on the highways and the byways
The police state be sprayed into the backstreet to the driveways
Officer friendly is an enemy now, looking at me sideways
Shit was all bad just a week ago
The view was just as sad just a peep ago
The cries of the asiatic ancient-semitic peoples
That propel Jay Elec from the pedestal to the steeple

To the mothers (they neglected) to the fathers (they rejected)
To the sisters (disrespected) to the brothers (unprotected)
All of us (all of us) all of us (all of us) {all of us}
We send this one out to
To the mothers (they deceited) to the fathers (they mistreated)
To the sisters (they misleaded) to the brothers (that get beated)
All of us (all of us) all of us (all of us) {all of us}
This is happening to all of us
To the mothers (they neglected) to the fathers (they rejected)
To the sisters (disrespected) to the brothers (unprotected)
All of us (all of us) all of us (all of us) {all of us}
We send this one out to
To the mothers (they deceited) to the fathers (they mistreated)
To the sisters (they misleaded) to the brothers (that get beated)
All of us (all of us) all of us (all of us) {all of us}
This is happening to all of us

We've got to live
Live to the end (we gotta do, we do)
We've got to live (for our grandmothers)
Live to the end (and granddaddies too)
We've got to live (live for the babies)
Live to the end (my brothers out there going crazy)
"Niggas is tellin' me about this Illuminati shit while I'm in jail - that's another way to keep your self-esteem low, that's another way to keep you unconfident. And I'm putting the 'K' cause I'm killing that Illuminati shit. Trust me. These motherfuckers wanted to kill you, why the fuck they gonna tell Farrakhan, why they gonna tell the Nation of Islam, why they gonna tell this nigga in jail about the plan? How did he know? How'd it leak to him? Who told him? Who told him, the Pope? Who? Cause they like, 'the Pope' and 'the money', aw c'mon man, get the fuck outta here."

Oh you niggas wanna get deep?
Niggas wanna kick knowledge?
Y'all niggas ain't deep man, y'all niggas lost me
Soon as you steady tryna tell me which rappers in the fuckin Illuminati
Then I'm like, show me the proof right?
Niggas start talking about the anti-Christ and aliens and shit
Save the ghost stories for the kids nigga, I'm a grown ass man
Let's go, let's go

You can lead a man to a drink
But you can't make him take a sip
You can lead a man to a link
But that don't mean he gonn' click
What's this? Y'all ain't really on no deep shit
I peeped it, scared of a motherfuckin' secret
Society and only bein' with people you agree with
You scared of a chalice scared of death
Only thing worse is your silence
Illuminatis enlightened, the OWL see in the darkness
Masonic roots still survive from the book of dearly departed
Egyptologist and scholars
Symbologists at the college
Will all acknowledge that ancient Kemet is where it started
Way farther back than the knights
Or the Rite of the Scottish
You need to wake up, no new Bugatti
My enemy tryna stop me but I don't stand a chance
If I can't identify 'em properly
Illuminati as we know it started in Bavaria
Years before it landed on the shores of America
The mission: abolishment of government and religion
They were enemys of the state
And they was hated by the Christians
They was Poets, they was Scholars
Early Illuminati was sorta like the students
In Victor Hugo's Les Miserables
The modern day politicians would diss 'em
Turning them into martyrs
This in turn inspired the founding fathers
The vast majority Masons who were the subject of the Illuminati
Found this fascination the order was insipiration
And ain't no disrespect to the masons
But you try to keep secrets then it leads to speculation
Only those in league with Satan need to hide infomation
That's how you catch a ride to your final destination
Where the proof, show 'em proof put it all on the table
When the facts are intact ain't no need for a fable
Good versus evil is primitive
Real life's more complex, what's your context?
They put the symbols on the dollar bill, the monument, the obelisk
They honouring Columbia the children of the colonists
You can trace it back to the root trace it back again
It's really just another case of stealin' from the African
Racism and vanity justify the sale of flesh
You property like cattle or produce but are you still as fresh?
Population control is real, you know the deal
But still perpetuate the cycle of violence
We known to hold the steel
No, I don't need no fuckin' chorus
Used to read so many books
Thought I was a hoarder down at Borders
Like Behold the Pale Horse or The New World Order
But you really don't know what you reading
If you really don't know the author
A lot of Satan worship is just government propaganda
Unsubstantiated lies with no proof a bunch of slander
Of course there are forces against you and that's a fact
Don't get caught in the distraction, it's bigger than any rapper
The truly oppressed ain't got the luxury of inventing a monster
The devil incarnate is much realer than the devil in concert
What they doing so sinister
Worse than any blood sacrifice you can imagine
Iller than any cinema
The Federal Reserve, the World Bank and the IMF
Helping the poor get poorer you in debt until your dying breath
Food, vaccines, humanitarian aid
They want control of the region, they really tryna get paid
Obey thy consumer make a product out of man
Where's the conspiracy? It's always been the plan
Y'all niggas scared of one world currency
But still paying your taxes
It ain't the Illuminati that worry me
Lack of spiritual energy, suicidal tendencies
Unwitting soldiers in the armies of the enemy
I'm leaking information so follow me down the wormhole
Same reason that they called Bradley Manning a turncoat

(Man, we supposed to be brothas!)
Oh what you tryna get smart?
Nigga you tryna kick some knowledge?
Nigga fuck that give me your muthafuckin jewelry nigga
Take that shit off
Oh you got a pager too huh?
You a balla huh? You a balla huh?
Gimme that muthafuckin' shit
Better me than the muthafuckin cops nigga
This is a tear jerker

The revolution's here
No one can lead you off your path
You'll try to change the world
So please excuse me while I laugh
No one can change your ways
No one can lead you off your path
You'll try to change the world
So please excuse me while I laugh

Yo, I heard it's said the revolution won't be televised
But in the land of milk and honey there's a date you gotta sell it by
Otherwise it just expires and spoils
And these folks jump out the pot when the water too hot
Cause the fire boils inside
You go to church to find you some religion
And all you hear is connivin' and gossip and contradiction and
You try to vote and participate in the government
And the muh'fuckin' Democrats is actin' like Republicans
You join a organization that know black history
But ask them how they plan to make money and it's a mystery
Lookin' for the remedy but you can't see what's hurtin' you
The revolution's here, the revolution is personal
They call me the political rapper
Even after I tell 'em I don't fuck with politics
I don't even follow it
I'm on some KRS, Ice Cube, Chris Wallace shit
Main Source, De La Soul, bumpin' "2Pacalypse Now"


Yo, I speak at schools a lot cause they say I'm intelligent
No, it's cause I'm dope, if I was whack I'd be irrelevant
I'm like the dope in your tracks until your high is settled in
You leanin' to the left, the laughter's the best medicine
But the troubles you have today you just can't laugh away
Stay optimistic, thinking change is gonna come like Donny Hathaway
You have to pray, on top of that, act today
Cause opportunity shrivel away like Tom Hanks in "Cast Away"
Everybody pass away, the pastor prays, the family mournin'
Everybody act accordin' to the season that they born in (You'll try to change the world)
You fight in the streets, start bleedin' 'til the blood is pourin'
In the gutter, mothers cry 'til the Lord be livin' by the sword and
All that folks want is safety, they goin' gun crazy
The same reason Reagan was playin' war games in the '80s
The same reason I always rock dog chains on my babies
The struggle is beautiful, I'm too strong for your slavery


It's a beautiful thing that's happenin' right now
Right now G
Yo, I'm rockin' with my man Hi-Tek on the track right now
We fightin' the good fight
The Beautiful Struggle
Yeah, let's go
(So please excuse me while I laugh)
Uh uh, yea yea uh uh
Turn the music up, uh uh
Yea yea, yea yea, yea yea
Okay okay, we almost there
Let's go let's go, uh uh
Yea yea, yea yea, yeah, yeah, yeah

É tudo nosso
Conexão Brasil, Estados Unidos
É pra chapar rapá...
Eu tenho o prazer de dizer que tou ahhh
Aqui agora para cantar para você, para balançar
Se voce quiser, pode chegar, pode dancar
Ohhhhhhhh

Last night I had a dream that was so real
I woke up in a cold sweat, it felt so ill
I stared into the face of an angel
Tainted by the city, you ain't from this place it'll change you
Walkin by, I thought I was sly
Offered to try, at first I thought she was shy
'Til I saw this guy at the bar talkin to her reckless
She ignored him, cast a glance in my direction, started dancin to my section
... Her body flyer than a jet pilot
What a smile and the eyes like wet violets
They flutter by like the wings of the butterfly
Keep it tight, Eva Mendes in The Other Guys
Got me in another zone - they call her Sunshine like
"Put your mother on the phone, I ain't comin home"
Put a deposit on a place in her heart
All along she a place from the start
My favela love, man I fell in love, man I fell in love
Man I fell in love, man I fell in love
Man I, man I fell in love
Man I, man I, uh

Ehhhh, a gente é desse jeito mesmo é diferente
Ehhhh, é brasileiro é swingueiro, é coração
Ehhhh, a gente é que bota fé na vida pode cre
Tamo ai para viver para encarar
(Ehhh) A vida pro que der e vier
É nois que tá na fita agora pode crê
Brasil crescendo a gente tá ai para aparecer
Se voce quiser colar com a gente, não tem nada não
A gente vai correndo junto nessa mesma união
Brasil o povo de mistura raca pé no chão
Objectividade na vontade de crescer

A feeling of panic engulfin the whole planet
Yet my words are slow dancin, my language is romantic
Vocabulary that's bustin your capillaries
My freedom'll taste sweeter than juices of blacker berries
My adversaries speak I'll of my name, I'm so sick
Attack is very guerilla, my game is so pimp
Everything fall into place, it's gravitational
Profit stay in the black, the shade is so un-fadeable
Healthy relationship make your other ones better
I'm Lee Scratch Perry, they call me the upsetter
For the cheddar get the bread up
Mr. International call it the bruschetta, the spiritual newsletter
I wish you knew the arc of the story and knew your part
You're lookin into my heart or just lookin to be a part
From a boss in my prime, look how we crossin the finish line
How you tired, I stay wired like I was offered a line


Uh, uh
I don't wanna bang it or beat it, hit it or stab it
You're listenin to voodoo, I call it the black magic
You jammin up the traffic, you bubble, it don't stop
It might blow up but it won't go pop
"Pow!" That's the sound like onomatopoeia
Got me floatin when you (Rockin My Boat) like you Aaliyah
Got them African features like people out in Bahia
Mix tobacco with the reefer like you was a European
When I leave I'm gonna miss you, (Official) like Kardinal
Trust I'll come back and I'll visit for carni-val
When I come back around, take me out on the town
And you can show me how you put it down
My favela love, man I fell in love, man I fell in love
Man I fell in love, man I fell in love
Man I, man I fell in love
Man I, yea, yea yea...
Ghetto to ghetto, backyard to yard
We tear it up y'all, bless the mic with the gods
Precious metals round our necks and arms
We tear it up y'all, bless the mic with the gods

Whatever's in your heart is where you want to be
My hood is the ghetto
Even when you look it's never what you see
My hood is the ghetto
I've been down before up is just a reach
Cause my hood is the ghetto
Catch a second wind then begin again
My hood is the ghetto

Black magic in the hood, it's tragic but understood
Crack addicts, crack windows, crack wood
Even what's bad becomes good, status becomes stood
Upon the pedestal welcome to the ghetto show
Federal buildings, pissy hallways filled with children pushing children
Fiends lips peeling, shit seems real and
What's real is the estate of mind that we're in
The situation feels great
My man peels weight, so he can fill plates
You might get love but you still feel hate
With gang shakes and chain clinks, we communicate
Chicago to Brooklyn nigga real ones do relate

If lyrics sold, then truth be told
I'd probably be just as rich and famous as Jay-Z
Truthfully I wanna rhyme like common sense
Next best thing I do a record with Common Sense
Cause it's the music, the blues, it's the jazz, it's acoustics
Soul, Rock and Roll, the hip-hop that we producin', yea
It's the gear, it's the flare, it's the stare
Nowadays they'll shoot you where they used to shoot the fair
Remember lost soldiers, pour a beer, shoot the air
We got our own elected officials, no matter who the mayor
I know you know what I'm talking about
From New York to the South, take off your shoes when you walk in the house


Yo, I grew up where they're playin' skelly in the parking lot
And sell paintings of Aaliyah, B.I.G. and Pac up in the barbershop
Buildings too big so you don't really see the stars a lot
But rappin', drinkin', and goin' to prison you see them bars a lot
I feel the spirit in the dark and hear it in my heart
And always keep my ears to the block till I dearly depart
Hip-hop is really the art
We have to express the part of ourselves that make us want to martyr ourselves
It ain't harder to tell when somebody stick you up and put the hammer to you
They want them dead presidents like stic.man and Mutulu
With a gun to your jaw, these kids don't run anymore
Kicks is a hundred or more

A man in front of the store, beggin' for money and mercy
I told him say a prayer under his breath, he cursed me
Niggas is thirsty I heard it's a drought
Up early, servin' from their grandmother's house
Sometimes the ghetto feels desolate, the eyes of the hood yo is desperate
Affected by the deficit, times and lessons get hard
Either get by or get God, but you try to get by
It's like the block keep blockin'
You try to make moves, its like the car keep stoppin'
These shorties in the court, need Cochran yea
I tell them while the weed seeds poppin', in the game you need options
No time for feet watchin', me and Kwe keep rockin' for the ghetto
That is great, good for you
Okay get out of the way though
Thank you, excuse me, excuse me

Been a long time, shouldn’t have left you
Without a dope beat to step to
Say uhh, shouldn’t have left you
Without a dope beat to step to, say
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
C’mon, the word is back
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
Yeah, y’know you heard of that
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
You know the word is back
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
Yes, I know you heard of that

Psychopath, ride a tricycle in a biker’s club
Mike Tyson face tatted, addict like it rough
Hey scatterbrain, don’t get your grey matter punched up
Til you're hunched, tucked, talking like you punch drunk
One love, two maybe if I’m drunk enough
Naked watching three painted ladies do the bump and rub
Mean mugging Jean the Heebs call meshugenah
Booking her in the Catskills like, look at her rap skills
E-book in the backpack, the nerd in the Rat Pack
Jean Martin de Bergerac, you heard of her murder rap
Her murder rep, then learn it, confirm it and burn its audio
Music for your convertible, use it for burning cardio
Don’t use it with burners, they’ll find me in your stereo
And blame me for the murders, lock me up and get me carried off
I know I said murder before murder murder, fuck it, murder
Make it four, insert a learning curve
Mine is so high you get vertigo, assertive girl, infernal glow
Eternally superlative, blindfolded learn to drive
At night up on a girder bridge, hurt her no
Tyler Durden nerve in this, the boys are back
Oh yes the boys in black, the boy’s a {Black Star}, rap star
Jean a rock star, minus the Pharrell and all the cop cars
Rock soft, lock bars with the realest in the spot
Really y’all should get on your knees and pray us for our forgiveness, say


I’m a man of God who asked the Devil for some face time
The Shaitan, you never see him coming cause you're faith blind
The mainline, Bloods is waving flags like K’Naan
The Crips throwing gang signs
The Beast in the street bear they teeth like a canine
Get low like the bassline
Jean and Kwa think alike like great minds
The crown is on my head, what makes you think that you can take mine
They know they’ll never win but still they racist like a hate crime
Run the track like Tyra in Higher Learning
We bleeding gasoline so we keeping the fire burning
We speeding like Valvoline and we speak for a higher purpose
You believe in magazines, I deliver entire sermons
You need some Vaseline cause your shit is dryer than deserts
You never fired a weapon in your life so
Picturing yourself as a gangster the only way that you shooting
My intelligent design is a product of evolution
Psychotic, erotic catch phrases just to get at your girl
Create solutions for a digital world
So baby even when I’m spitting game I’m adding on
Rappers going hard, the G.O.A.T
I got an acronym for Capricorn
Centered And Prepared, Rigorous, Innovative
Captivating, Ordinary, Regular, Nigga just
Growing daily, your chick goin crazy yo
Handle her like Chelsea Lately
Rocking the fresh kicks like you felt the baby
We’ll wait til you done being whack
We got every hand up from the front to the back
If you wondering why dudes is dressing funny in rap
They need attention dog, there ain’t no more money in rap
So if you mixing with GarageBand, videos on the Flip cam
I’m a big fan, you got more heart than Bret The Hit Man
But shit damn, it’s the pinnacle, gets no better
I’m boasting, but still stay humble
Never cynical, I’m posting
Yeah
Yo...let me, let me, let me, let me tell you why - why
This nigga...why we dedicated this song to this kind of nigga
Cuz number one, duke is drivin' in the motherfuckin' projects
With a - with a Sebring, and with - with a rag off
Y'na'mean? Y-you not ballin' like that play-boy
Straight up, then the bitch you got playin' shotgun
Like, I used to serve that bitch, c'mon
Really really good, I mean and you gotta shirt and tie
You wack ass nigga...

Wack niggas...I don't even like to be around 'em
Give 'em dap or pound 'em
See 'em out, they houndin' dawg
Sayin' they got tracks for me to get down on
Sayin' they hot when that shit don't even sound warm
Nigga I'm nasty, my style is sound porn
The graphic, exposin' wack asses
I emcee as free as Ol' Dirty Bastard
You think you Catholic tryin' to appeal to the masses
The Cassius Clay of rap today
Rock a beard like Castaway
You couldn't be dope for even half a day
We keep it hot like its after May
Smoke a nigga then I pass to K

The pastor say we goin' to mass today
We have to pray, these niggas is wack 'n' eh
I have to say, since Pac passed away
Most these niggas don't even deserve a track from me
First of all let's get rid of them Louis Vuitton boots
And get yo tall ass out that C Class coupe
Y'see the whiskay had them girls feelin' friskay
You was with mey, she said "Who's the sissay?"
And even if they did wanna get bizzay
Freaky like Missay and roll the weed up
You would roll three blunts and fuck up three blunts
Motherfucka you would fuck up a free lunch, dawg
Just keep it right thurr like Chingay
Yo girl don't like me how long has shee been gay
Spanish girls tell ya "No hable ingle"
And everbody wanna run to me for they single
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dawg, if I was you I wouldn't feel myself
Dawg, if I was you I'd kill myself

(Wack nigga) Wake up in the morning dawg, and you a
(Wack nigga) I'd kill myself if I was that
(Wack nigga) Everything you wear and rock, is just
(Wack nigga) Even if you flossin' rocks you still
(Wack nigga) You can't do it dawg, you's a
(Wack nigga) Bitin' ass, bitch ass, trick ass
(Wack nigga) Even your daughter says "My daddy's a - "
(Wack nigga - You wack nigga!)

You know you wack when ya dawgs tell you
That's how you know ya flow is weak
Cuz you only got them there to 'Say Yes' like Floetry
The clique that I oversee ain't impressed by ya poetry
You're the place you're supposed to be
You ain't ain't comin' close to me
It ain't that you underrated
It's more that you're under dated
And mediocre at best is all the hoes you've ever dated
For all your guest appearances
You couldn't get the clearances
For them it's just a check they don't respect you as a lyricist
Look at what ya lyrics is, Murder, Death, Kill
But you never shot nothin', never have, never will
Better add on to ya skills before you join this round robin
Of super emcees that'll add to ya problems

In the beginnin', God created man in his own image
I'm 'bout to tell you how the story gon' finish
Kweli handle his business, niggas don't forget it
Cause a wiseman can choose to get ignorant with it
Na'mean - you all can get it, I'm conisdered the nicest
The way I spit it give these niggas all identity crisis
All day talkin' that shit like, "You hold a gat, right?"
The trip you on must be short cause you pack light - act right
You got it twisted, tellin' niggas that you pack heat
You ain't gunning now, you runnin' like an athlete
You ballas need to quit rhymin' like Allen Ive
Start speakin' Nuwaubian and followin' Malachi
Or anything but rhyme, you need to sell drugs for real
Instead of on the radio, you'd be dead or in jail
All these thug niggas wanna rap
And all these rap niggas wanna thug
And all ya'll fuckin' the game up
It's time to change up, my lyrics rip ya frame up
Askin' if I'm nice like fuckin' with a chick
Who don't give head - that's a no-brainer
Niggas back bangers you don't even know the names of
I'mma bout to meet my quota, you about to meet ya Saviour
You wack nigga, you about to get shot
Fuck with Talib Kweli, that's how you get got boy!
Not that I'm wildin' or even promote violence
It's just you're fuckin' up my high, can a nigga smoke in silence?!
Yeah
Yeah! That's what I'm talkin about!
Let's do it... Kanye West, c'mon turn me up and
Black Thought, c'mon turn me up and
Pharoahe Monch, c'mon turn me up and
Talib Kweli in the house with

Guerrilla Monsoon rap - all the shorties like "who dat?"
Got the whole crowd like "how ya do dat?"
Nigga you, get smacked 'til ya blue black
And ya crew, give me dap like true dat
We come through and all the shorties like "who dat?"
Got the whole crowd like "how ya do dat?"
Nigga you, get smacked 'til ya blue black
And ya crew, give me dap like true dat

Yo, I hit these emcees with the grip of death like I was a Vulcan
Ain't a lot of "ifs" an "ands", it's just straight talkin
It's hard to swallow at times, so take portions
Bitin off more than you can chew, create orphans
Emcee species endangered like dolphins
Rappers is spittin nails into they own coffins (c'mon)
Hear come the Dundee moves rocket-launchin (yeah)
Black Thought, quit playin him close and back up off him

Kweli -- spruce to the tree, Bruce to the Lee
The real emcee, that your favorite rapper used to be
One by one I knock 'em out like Schoolly D - my rhymes is eulogy
A flea could move a tree, before ya think ya movin me
I black and blue emcees - actin new to me, get smacked stupidly
They lack skills, like the black community lack unity (uh)
Still my rhymes hurt like Ali to Fraiz'
Step off the stage to shouts of "Kweli boomayyay!!"

See these four emcees came to get down
Rearrange the rap game, change ya whole sound
Nigga YOU, got ta, understand the plot ta
Movin and groovin and always improvin alot-ta
I'll outfox the, average Porsche Boxster talk
Break the bank on some old Frank Sinatra (New York...)
Slash Chi-Town, slash Philly
Check the blast from Geneva, you can get slapped silly


Okay... my sound drenches, each of the five senses
And hold the shock value of electrified fences
It's truth or consequences, ride wit us or against us
Is you a dedicated soldier, or you a princess, dog?
I'm in it to win it and not for the wealth
Got a crib with a Grammy and a gat on the shelf
Nan nigga competition, gotta battle myself
And me and Kweli on a mission, gettin Pharoahe for help

From natives walkin the Trail of Tears to players sippin Belvedere
We always comin well prepared, and all my dogs' smellin fear
PLUS, even my niggas from the Bay, they say you hella scared
Truth or consequences, and all senses be well-aware
Your style - under-developed there, hell if I care
What hardship you claim to see, but I can tell by your stare
Nigga you fugazi, sayin ya crew blazin
Like sayin Miss Cleo is a true Jamaican, we makin

Guerrilla Monsoon rap, smell the fumes, get in tune wit it
When I attack your city, y'all gon' think Dr. Doom did it
Spit it like white trash in seed-spittin contests
With a vendetta that sent a betta letter bomb to Congress
I'm pissed - cumulus clouds of ominous
Words of the Thor, the rawness that'll restore ya calmness
Unless, you wanna be leg and armless
That's parapaleg' for those who believe in bomb threats
I try, I try
I try, you know I try
I try, I try
I try, you know I try

K. West! Kweli!
Got searched on the plane, Arabic first name
Disturbed by the fame just like Kurt Cobain
Breath of life, kiss of death, my lips pursed the same
You flirt 'til she came
Nothin' hurt like the pain and torture
Daughters of the dust lookin' for a vein
Something to take in vain like the Lord's name
Put your hands together, got 'em all sayin'

I try, I try
I try, you know I try
I try, I try
I try, you know I try

Yo, it's all ghetto in gear higher than falsetto
More metal for beef that we don't let the law settle
I try to navigate the treacherous waters of
America's ghettos that set up to slaughter us
But there's more of us
Although we speak in different languages
We all pretty familiar with what anger is
Young and dangerous, trigger stranglers
Get up on some gangsta shit
Guns to bang ya wit'
And we put it on records to entertain ya wit'
Our growing pains go way deeper than Mike Seaver's
Our uniforms is white sneakers and white T-shirts
On top of wife beaters
We like to light reefers
The 'hood need us for rappers, just ain't the right leaders
I put a lot into it
This is my product and I gotta move it
Stop the industry but you can't stop the music

An upside down kingdom where life is just not fair (upside down kingdom)
Some many sufferin' cuz deep inside they're scared (so scared)
Fear pumped into their veins to keep them from their destiny
Where would they be if you and I don't care?

I try, I try
I try, you know I try
I try, I try
I try, you know I try

Yo, the things I'm seein' on the news is insane
A stock broker shoot his kid and throw himself in front of a train
A mother leave her baby home for two weeks all by himself
Three years old, eatin' ketchup and mustard, cryin for help
Tryin' to bring your struggle to life
The label want a song about a bubbly life
I have trouble tryin' to write some shit
To BANG in the club through the night
When people suffer tonight
Lord knows I try

I try, I try
I try, you know I try
I try, I try
I try, you know I try

Life is a beautiful struggle
People search through the rubble for a suitable hustle
Some people usin' the noodle, some people usin' the muscle
Some people put it all together, make it fit like a puzzle
Come on, say it now
Life is a beautiful struggle
People search through the rubble for a suitable hustle
Some people usin' the noodle, some people usin' the muscle
Some people put it all together, yeah

I try, I try
I try, you know I try
I try, I try
I try, you know I try
Upside down kingdom
Oh, they're so scared
Everyday on the news we can't look around with
Something somewhere
I try, I try, you know I try
I try, I try, I try, you know I try
Lord knows, Lord knows we try
Yeah
Yeah man
So I start looking out the window
I see gun store, gun store, liquor store, gun store
Where the fuck are you taking me?

We bout to twist it up
We bout to lift it up
We never givin' up
The startin' salary, it's hard reality
Find solidarity
We got our leaders too but where they lead us ?
Do they leave us or they see it through?
Yeah we packin' precious metals
Our shit is next level
We raise the threat level

Every ghetto, every city, like Ms. Hill
They way too used to the missed meals
Hard to concentrate, hard to sit still
Murder rate permanent place in the top 10
We live here, these hipsters drop in
You hear them barrels cockin'
They say consciousness mean a nigga ain't rugged
Until they get beat within an inch of it
Self made niggas don't get discovered
They actin' like you owe 'em somethin'
Homie I don't owe you nothin'
Fuck your beef
It's way too early in the mornin' for the hate
You ain't brushed your teeth yet nigga
And your toast ain't buttered
A perfect storm and the coast is flooded
Most discovered that my flow got 'em
You posers sound like  stuttered
Man I'm goin' too fast, let me slow it down

I'm good walkin' in every ghetto around the world
The hood often embrace ya when you profound with words
I say the shit they relate to, I keep it down to Earth
Other rappers sound like they hate you, them niggas sound absurd
So when they walk through the ghetto they get their chain snatched
They gotta talk to the ghetto to get their chain back
It's like an open air prison and it remain packed
Nothin' but straight facts

Indie 5, for the people by the people
Ya-ya, giddy up, who got the juice now?
Snatch it out your kiddies cups
The shit you gave us watered down
This one's for Basquiat
They be brushin' with death, uh
Is this The Art Of War for cops?
We double-dutchin' duckin' shots
Every home ain't got a Pops
Every man ain't sellin' rocks
A different will to win here
Different from switchin' cars
They pray that we switch our bars
To a fiend from a metaphor
Worldstar, Worldstar
Lotta love and this life hard
Keep us prayin' like "oh God"
Illegally thievery think us peelin' off easily
Frustrated we hate it
That's why we scream out "nigga we made it"
It's an odd future they ain't know we was all some creators
Somethin' from nothin' was told Kings walk and man you frontin'
For the people and by the people but them over money
I'm on my Viola Davis here, workin' for justice
How you get away with murder? Be a cop and just kill us
How we supposed to not catch feelings?
Innocent lives, boy we got kids in these buildings
I'm on my Viola Davis, it's what you call a defense
For all the drama they gave us I'm spittin' Shonda Rhimes wit
Too high for you like ganja, that’s what Shonda rhyme with
I holla back in the Hamptons, you still black if you rich
Spread love ain't just the Brooklyn way, it's universal
360 and the nine lives, whoa, what a circle

We bout to live it up
We bout to give it up
We bout to twist it up
The startin' salary, it's hard reality
Find solidarity
We got our leaders too but do they leave us?
Or they lead us and they see it through?
Ready or not

We know
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
It’s bad here on Earth, but if we don’t get to heaven
It’s hell (it's all going to)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (yup, we living in)
Hell (yup, they giving us)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (yup, we living in)
Hell (word)

Every Sunday dressing up catching gossip at its worst
Couldn't see the difference in the Baptist and the Catholic Church
Caught up in the rapture of the first chapter and second verse
If we all God's children, then what's the word of the reverend worth?
Taught early that faith is blind like justice when you facing time
If we all made in God's image, then that means his face is mine
Wait or it's that blasphemy it's logical it has to be
If I don't look like my father, then the way I live is bastardly
Naturally that's confusion to a young'n tryna follow Christ
Taught that if you don't know Jesus, then you lead a hollow life
Never question the fact that Jesus was Jewish not a Christian
Or that Christianity was law according to politicians
Who was King James? And why did he think it was so vital
To remove chapters and make his own version of the Bible?
They say Hell is underground and Heaven is in the sky
And they say that's where you go when you die
But how they know?

We know
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
It’s bad here on Earth, but if we don’t get to heaven
It’s hell (it's all going to)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (yup, we living in)
Hell (yup, they giving us)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (yup, we living in)
Hell (yup, they giving us)

I've been to many churches, I've quoted many verses
I've dealt with my base self, I controlled my many urges
I used to study my lessons, it was a blessing, not a curse
I learned that Heaven and Hell exist right here on Earth, word
Studied with Rastafarians and learned from the dreads that hell
Is called Babylon and that's where them crazy baldheads dwell
They got us thinking that Muslims like to make bombs
But real Muslims believe in paradise and the resist the Shaitan
So it all sound the same to me
That's why when they say one is right and the other is wrong
It just sound like game to me
It's like God skipped past the church and came to me
No that ain't vein to me
It's just a particular way that I came to see
The difference between those who claim to be
Religious and those that say they spiritual
And recognizing that life is full of miracles
You could see my glow in a rhyme
The poem divine cause it coincide with a grow in the time
That those who looking for God knowin' to go inside

We know
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
It’s bad here on Earth, but if we don’t get to heaven
It’s hell (it's all going to)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (yup, we living in)
Hell (yup, they giving us)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (yup, we living in)
Hell (yup)

Living in mass confusion, looking for absolution
The gas seducin' and psychopath produce the last solution
Based on his interpretation of what the words were saying
Trying to get to God but ended up doing the work of Satan
Religion create division, make the Muslim hate the Christian
Make the Christian hate the Jew, make the rules of faith
That you condition to and to you gotta follow
And God forbid you go to Hell
But if you ever walked through any ghetto then you know it well

Momma say it's her after me
Preacher say it's blasphemy
I say there's gotta be a better explanation
This dance is just me and you
I pray to God, here's you
Take one look at your rear view
And you can see what I see
That could only mean

We know (hey)
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
It’s bad here on Earth, but if we don’t get to heaven
It’s hell (it's all going to)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (yup, we living in)
Hell (yup, they giving us)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (it's all going to)
Hell (yup, we living in)
Hell (yup, they giving us)
We know
That what we reap we sow
But we forget how low
We can go
It’s bad here on Earth, but if we don’t get to heaven
It’s hell
Hell
Hell
Hell
Hell
Hell
Hell
Hell

The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want
Just because the lord is my shepherd don't mean I gotta be no sheep
You feel me?
More blood is spilled over religion than anything in world history
We saying the same thing
.
Yeah
Special dedication
I'm sendin' this one out to you
And you and you and you
I said to you and you and you

She cold blooded
I love how we meltin' the ice
She like the sunshine of my life
Cause all I see is a hot thing
You're my hot thing
And you're my hot thing
And you're my hot thing
Word, you keep my dark sky lit up at night
So bright that you blinding my sight
Cause all I see is a hot thing
And you're my hot thing
And you're my hot thing
And you're my hot thing
Word, somebody like a flick
It got surprisin' twists
I write the script
The main character - your thighs and hips
Award for best supportin' role go to your eyes and lips
The way you move your body got 'em stiff like a hieroglyph
I watched you dance across the floor to the title track
You 'bout to get me "Off The Wall" like you Michael Jack'
I make a scribe in your beauty my sacred duty
I will write a song, write a book, write a play, make a movie

Good love you a sexy thing
And all I'm sayin' is you got somethin' I like
Love that you like it
Love that you like it
Love that you like it

Yo, I love your country ass
I love your city sass
I love how you know my ways
You catch on pretty fast
These dudes are pretty crass
Harass you in your past
I love how you snap back and get the last laugh
I love the way your crib smell like Votivo candle incense
The White voice you use on the phone when you handle business
I love it when you freaky
I love when you a lady
Rockin' door knockers from the late 80s, raisin' babies
I love her; god bless you
Your body somethin' special
I love to play connect the dots with your facial freckles
No need for fashion policin' because I love your style
Whatever happen to Shenice, baby I love your smile
I might be fallin' in love, should I let her know
A pimp told me if I love her I should let her go
I sing her praises every time they play this instrumental
Cause she instrumental to my life


I love how we meltin' the ice
You like the sunshine of my life
Cause all I see is a hot thing
You're my hot thing
And you're my hot thing
And you're my hot thing
Word, you keep my dark sky lit up at night
So bright that you blinding my sight
Cause all I see is a hot thing
And you're my hot thing
And you're my hot thing
And you're my hot thing
Word, lemme take you by the hand
You need to tell your man, don't fight it, damn
Have you groupied out like excited fans
I promise you'll be climbing walls like Spider-Man
Knees bucklin' you'll hit the floor when you try to stand (up)
So you drop it like it's hot - oh so heavy
You and me we can leave now - we can go steady
How about we be jetty cause I'm so ready to bounce like a '64 Chevy
Girl you're outstanding
From your hips to your thighs
It's  how you standing out
Girl you're outstanding
So let's not waste no time
Let's get it girl cause tonight it's ours, yeah

While you walking, everybody watching you closely
Hitting them high notes, nothing about you low key
Just let it register, body is unreal
Was animated like Jessica...
Rabbit a cartoon, wanna stab like a harpoon
These dudes is dry; the club a desert
Your body like an oasis
The thirst is so real, you can see it all in they faces
Especially when you drop it low, baby you gotta know
Girl you be killing them, filling them with all kind of hope
Dude on the block that be selling dope
By the shoes and the watch you can tell he's broke
Tell him stop with the lies he telling folks, you can't see with a telescope
Celebrating, holding glasses up like Sara Palin nose
Love it in the club when the fellows go
But you hate that your hair gotta smell like smoke
They ask you what is hitting for
Nigga try to fix the prices, never dealt with chicks before
You ain't got your liquor license, still you down to live your life
If dude is down to split the slice of pie... you like the master active fly
Until you hit it right
Hey you girl with the tight up-skirt
In the back of the club where they light up purp'
Known to drop it like a stripper, with her night off work
They make it rain and you stuffing dollars right in your, purse


You just looking for somebody that can fill in the spot
Fill in the blank, yeah shorty, you've been sipping a lot
Feeling the drink, as it seeps to your head
You erase your regrets
Throw another shot back, as you race to forget
Yeah the night just started, we both parted from ex love
Sleep won't make you forget him baby but sex does
Swear you ain't looking for no one night stand
But you prepared to risk it all for that one right man
Ask me, let's have a toast to your future
I know you belong to
Leave your ex in the past, don't let him haunt you
The last argument was world war III, but follow me
I introduce you to that bourgeoisie
Talk is cheap, welcome to the R. Les show
You'll be my Brigitte Bardot, I'll be your Serge Gainsbourg
Give you what you came for, let me get that car door
Have you ever made love in the Lambo Gallardo
I come from the God body era
I come from standing on street corners
Smoking blunts out of white owls with 40s
Building and destroying about the suns
And the planets and the moons and the stars
About the nature of man
About knowledge, wisdom, and understanding
And you had to show and prove
And you had to be right and exact

Voulez-vous, rendezvous, coucou le poopoo, come on!
Yeah Chris, yeah, I like that right there, yeah!
Hah, come on! Yeah
KAYTRANADA, classic

Waste these niggas, son, I got a doctorate in rockin it
Pardon, we got it poppin, it's marvelous, nigga watch it
You follow a carbon copies I'm stoppin' to intervene
You're erroneous, these the phoniest rappers I've ever seen
When I take flight, I'm traveling light, that's a double entendre
For when I'm touring, exploring outside the genre
Illuminate, when I grabbin the mic, it's so bright it'll blind you
Yeah I'm back with a friendly reminder
We're two ships that're passing in the night, but alas
You got to run into the iceberg, I'm cracking this shit in half
Traveling light, not talking about back of the back
First I get back in the lab, then I hit the road, I'll be back in a flash
I'm Barry Allen mixed with Harry Allen
My blood hot as volcanic rock forming canary diamonds they find on Canary Islands
My rhymes inspired by enviroments of the very violent
I'm the voice of a generation that's very silent
I stick to my convictions like I've been indicted
All you niggas throwing me shade you about to get enlightened

Travel light, travel light
Traveling light, travel light
You grinding 'til the sun up
Whether it's cold murder, the pies have been cut up
Hopping over the hurdles, just look at the stride
Life is heavy enough but you lifting me high
Huh, rather leave it behind
The legacy that you built will be left when you die, so
Brooklyn is changing, and so am I
I see you on the other side, travel light

Ay, I'm faster than the speed of sound
Smashing through these barriers, I'm blasting out your speakers now
Travel around the planet till I landin where I'm needed now
We entertainers, they wanna call us leaders now
Woah, extra baggage not in the plans, I'll shop when I land
Stop for the fans, every airport from Okinawa to Osaka, Japan
Stop assuming I live in your time zone
Jetlag is my reality, the road is my home, I roam
Your downfall is you should probably get out more
I been planning out tours, with a band of outlaws
I'm packing my bags, just marijuana and magazines
Wrapping the flag around a pistol, the red, the black and the green
Never crashing, the grill is mean when I'm whipping machines
Dipping between all these commuters, they moving slow like they sippin the lean
Are they living the dream? Get to they office
And that computer's drifting off until they spit start to drip from the screen

Travel light, travel light
Traveling light, travel light
You grinding 'til the sun up
Whether it's cold murder, the pies have been cut up
Hopping over the hurdles, just look at the stride
Life is heavy enough but you lifting me high
Huh, rather leave it behind
The legacy that you built will be left when you die, so
Brooklyn is changing, and so am I
I see you on the other side, travel light

City of broken promises, my mission is reconnaissance
It's dangerous for anybody following
That's why I take biting as a compliment, it's proof of my dominance
It's the haters' way of congratulating me for my accomplishments
Well, I'm so atop of this demolishing all the Charlotters
To whisper in the ears of your congressmen
Shoving dollars in their pockets, the more we locked up, the more they profiting
They building empires like Ottoman
Now who you wanna face? The sharks in the water or the snakes in the boat?
The lesser of two evils be fighting for fake votes
We walking through the valley of darkness so stay close
Need the light at the end of the tunnel to make a toast
Raise a glass to our glorious past, we the wave of the future
Never confusing protesters for looters
Silencing Radioheads and OK Computers
Travel to Mecca like Mansa Musa so let's go
(Yeah!)
The proud. Stand tall or don't stand at all, come on. Uhh, yeah. Break it down. What we do?

We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride

June 11, 2001. Timothy McVeigh is executed and the country breathe a sigh of relief. Goodness prevails over evil, it seems. Somehow when he's gone, we feel safer. Little do we know

Today the paper say Timothy McVeigh's in hell
So everything's okay and all must be well
I remember Oklahoma when they put out the blaze
And put Islamic terrorist bombing, on the front page
It's like saying only gays get AIDS, propaganda
Like saying the problem's over when they locked that man up
Wrong! It's just the beginning, the first inning
Battle for America's soul, the devil's winning
The President is Bush, the Vice President's a Dick
So a whole lot of fucking is what we gon' get
They don't wanna raise the babies, so the election is fixed
That's why we don't be fucking with politics
They bet on that, parents fought and got wet for that
Hosed down, bit by dogs, and got blacks into house arrest for that
It's all good except for that, we still poor
Money, power and respect is what we kill for, for real

It's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride

August 4, 2001. A drunken police officer mows down an entire family in Brooklyn. The judge lets him go with no bail. It reminds us, of just how worthless our lives are to the justice system. I struggle, to explain the situation to my son, it's hard

Niggas with knowledge is more dangerous than than niggas with guns
They make the guns easy to get and try to keep niggas dumb
Target the gangs and graffiti with the Prop 21
I already know the deal, but what the fuck do I tell my son?
I want him living right, living good, respect the rules
He's five years old and he still thinking cops is cool
How do I break the news that when he gets some size
He'll be perceived as a threat or see the fear in they eyes
It's in they job description to terminate the threat
So 41 shots to the body is what he can expect
The precedent is set, don't matter if he follow the law
I know I'll give my son pride and make him swallow it all (Damn!)
Fuck the pigs! I think the pigs killed Big and 'Pac too
If they didn't they know who did, they got to!
Who they serve and protect, nigga not you
Cops shot off of ten G's, but they got Glocks too
Let you protect yourself, or better yet respect yourself
Straight into the hospital is where you gotta check yourself
They be getting tips from snitches and rival crews
Doing them favors, so they working for the drug dealers too
Just business enforcers with hate in they holsters
Shoot you in the back, won't face you like a soldier
Kurt Loder asked me what I say to a dead cop's wife
Cops kill my people everyday, that's life

We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride

September 11, 2001. Terrorists attack the Pentagon and the World Trade Center kills thousands and permanently scars America's false sense of security. We see the best examples of humanity in the face of the worst. As firefighters, police officers, rescue workers and volunteers of all sorts, fight to save lives. The world will never be the same again

My heart go out to everybody at Ground Zero
Red, black, yellow, white and brown heroes
It's more complicated than black and white
To give your own life is the greatest sacrifice
But it's hard for me to walk down the block
Seeing rats and roaches, crack viles and 40 ounce posters
People broken down from years of oppression
Become patriots when they way of life is threatened
It's a hard conversation to have
We lost kids, moms and dads, people ready to fight for the flag
Damn, when did shit get this bad?
America kill the innocent too, the cycle of violence is sad
Damn! Welcome to the world, we here
We've been at, war for years but it's much more clear
We got to face what lies ahead
Fight for our truth and freedom and, ride for the dead

We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
Let's toast to paid mortgages, lasting marriages
Tina Farris's pay King to Paris
Living long, making my kids heirs and heiresses
The family crest, the legacy, the heritage
I'm out of Philly where the ecstasy and syrup is
And we don't need Theraflu, we need therapists
Them never-ending pursuit of them dead presidents
Is the reason I got the band back together, bitch
Yeah, it's me and 
North side, bomb squad, Eric Vietnam
If you don't see it like I see it then you see it wrong
We October 3rd niggas like me and Kwe'
Life got me in a state on the interstate
And all I'm thinking bout is what's up on my dinner plate
Meanwhile I make your girls hyperventilate
Prolly cause I live the kind of life art imitate

That's my art in your eyes, my life in your hands
We living next door to the Aquilius again
Pardon me fam
But I'mma show you how it is
I'mma show you how we get in

Rocking the Guy Fawkes mask like Anonymous
Passport pimping like I'm going outta town to flip
The ass for a symbol with the cops hopping out of whips
Bath salt niggas with the zombies apocalypse
I'm blessed cause my afterlife is the studio
This rappers life is gangster's paradise like I'm Coolio
That's what a few believe like a doobie roll
We off of that Patrón, we sipping the Don Julio
You talking shit? we don't need the chatter
Opinions are like assholes, not everybody fecal matter
So they straining to push it out, put they foot in their mouth
That's when I'm letting the Brooklyn out when they pull it out
Better let it off cause you set it off
The music that's creating a movement like it's December 4th
Threw away the dark meat but they ate the white
Animated like it's kind of darklit it's my wicked life
It imitate my life


Yeah, y'all keeping it 3hunnid, we keeping it 360
Coming full circle echelon don emcees with me
Tired of saying I'm the best, I won't waste another breath
Heard lyrics coming back, I say it never left
Y'all just catching up, so slow to come around
Ice-T gave ya cliff notes, I ain't gotta dumb it down
Cause I read the book, made the movie and I edit this
All while I be living it, and set the precedence
And get the presidents, fuck all the chit chat
Might hear the click clack, and I'mma diss back
Married to the game get the rice out Riff Raff
Nice being self employed, ain't gotta kiss ass
I ain't gotta slim fast, smack a ho with a love handle
Dare you to say you ain't a fan boo, roll a bamboo
Life imitating art imitating life, show you how the fam do
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money

I used to put the money first, y'all still do
But that hardly works cause y'all still ask for prices from
The waiters and you're hardly served
You pay once, you pay forever, that you can't reverse
That's why I ain't paid Talib for no fuckin' verse
Mutual respect over below payments
Your mind accepted marriage when money proposed slavery
I been listenin' and four quarters of y'all won't make it
I'm Africa's number one, that's a fuckin' bold statement
And I'm the most relevant
You failin' to admit that is your biggest impediment
We're not on the same level man
Your dream girl sent me nudes and I'm checkin' 'em
Underneath the table as I'm havin' dinner with the president
Man fuck the money
O tsenya tlhogo then otla ka plane
Eh sane, being broke's for makgokgorane
They love cause they know I'm bein' real to my peeps
There's niggas richer than me who still wish they were me
Wassup

Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money

Money make niggas break promises
Money turn niggas into pharmacists
Money make you drop outta colleges
But the bars that I spit through God exist
Who we be, that's who we are
Versace, Gucci, Louis Vuitton
My taste expensive as a superstar
So I take what I want like a coup d'état
From profit sharing to profiteering
Now they stop and stare cause we cop McLarens
But we not preparing for God's appearance
Too busy dominating and domineering
Our competition securin' our position
Now our greed dangerous as a heart condition
Rap niggas lie like politicians
So I gotta tell the truth, that's a smart decision
Capitalism is a cataclysm
If white collar crime is a bad decision
Then the makers who routinely crash the system
Would quickly get they asses dragged to prison
Need money to eat, need money to live
Need money to keep, need money to give
But when pursuit of the money is your only goal
Then you lose control, then you lose your soul
Dollars and cents to rob our children of their innocence
So when it's sent, we come to our nation's capital to cash the check
According to Dr. King when he saw it clear in his dream
"We built the pyramids, they built a pyramid scheme"

Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money, fuck the money
(Intro Talib Kweli)
Yo, we're going to have the word love
In many different languages translated all through the track
So, whenever you hear the word love
Know that, it's going to be in a different language
The language of love cannot be translated, yo
(Verse 1 Talib Kweli)
Love is blind, you just see bright light
You up in the club feelin' the night life, lookin' for the right type
Blood rushing to your heart making it beat
When she swept you off your feet and made it complete
You know the plan you had to conquer the world
Thinking you Scarface, looking for that perfect girl
And now you found her
Started with romantic, then got to frantic
Then things thats normally small become gigantic
Now y'all sinkin like the Titanic here come the panic
Being with you like a habit, without you I can't stand it
It's tragic when you wonder when you lost that magic
Without understanding that you never had it try to grab it
In the bed gettin a nut off, communication cut off
Getting mad cause you turned on wondering where she shut off
Constantly comparing you to someone in my past
We don't smile anymore, and we argue over cash
Advance to that physical shit
See what happens if you keep talkin
See what happens if you lay a finger on me motherf...
Yo, see what I'm sayin'
It's like one big mind game that everybody playin and
Niggas say bitches is trife, bitches say niggas is
We just don't understand our fundamental differences
I'm still learning though, actually
I just do what come naturally, naturally, naturally
(Chorus Les Nubians)
L'amour n'a pas de, frontiere (Love has no boundaries)
Restes car je t'aime comme tu es (Stay because I love you as you are)
J'ai traverse l'ocean du verbe (I crossed an ocean of words)
Et je t'ai trouve (And I found you)
(Verse 2 Talib Kweli)
Women thrive on emotions, men refuse to acknowledge
So when we arguin nobody win
Words get in the way time and again
Sticks and stones break your bones words break your heart
Whether you in touch with that part or not say "word"
Words are weapons for the revolutionary
Used for evil make the situation very scary
Word up, but love is brave
It flies in the face of fear
Yo, wherever you want to go love'll take you there
Let's go, you know a flower that grow in the ghetto
Know more about survival than the one from fresh meadows
It got love for the sun, that's where I'm comin from
Spit in this fashion cause I love rockin over drums
Word (te quiero) I put my love into my music
If you with me then you love how I do it
If my heart you're livin' in your ocean I'm swimmin' in
Never drowning got me floatin' watching you in slow motion
Love potion overdosin approachin
The explosion of my senses everyday without your heart
Is like a sentence in jail
Trust I'll always be mentally free
You got the key to let it out I'll show you how it could be
Love {*different language*} it ain't nuttin but a word
A chicken ain't nuttin but a bird
Yo, yo, yo
(Chorus Les Nubians)
L'amour n'a pas de, frontiere (Love has no boundaries)
Restes car je t'aime comme tu es (Stay because I love you as you are)
J'ai traverse l'ocean du verbe (I crossed an ocean of words)
Et je t'ai trouve (And I found you)
(Verse 3 Talib Kweli)
Some of y'all in love with that material but
Love enter my life like a miracle and
It reciprocal that's why I'm feeling you love
We exibit our natural behavior
Like making love under the moon in Jamaica
Get you so hot you call the name of the creata
The morning we hop back into action again
Up on the wall lovin how the sun blacken your skin
Remember when we explored the beach
Swam in the ocean and saw beneith
How the colors of the coral reef looked like the illest floral peice
That's what your beauty remind me of
It's hard to find a love like ours, taking it high above
Them other duns try to spit game but, I dont sweat it though
Know in my heart that we connected so I let it go
Now if they call you out your name and that's a different thing
Anything but Queen I'll go to war like a King
Your friends sweat you cause you ain't got a band
But they dont understand
Some things is meant to stay between a woman and man
And they ain't privy to it so they try to get into it
Both you and me see through it so the way we flow is fluid
We speak the love language, they speak from pain and anguish
Some don't love theyselves so they perception is tainted
Out they joint like "Shit, he payin for your rent" missin the point
When you rub me into your skin just like an ointment
It's more than pillow talk, it can't be translated
Learn how to speak it, and become emancipated
It's a language
Universal love...
(Chorus Les Nubians)
L'amour n'a pas de, frontiere (Love has no boundaries)
Restes car je t'aime comme tu es (Stay because I love you as you are)
J'ai traverse l'ocean du verbe (I crossed an ocean of words)
Et je t'ai trouve (And I found you)
Love love love love, love, love (Repeated)
Hands in the air (4X)
(Hook: Marsha Ambrosius)
Lord knows I had it hard today
Had it hard today
Still I gotta keep my head up high along the way
Cause it only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
(Bridge 1:Talib Kweli)
Every day I gotta wake up early
Let it break, thank the Lord at the take
Get the troops, hit the booth, spit  at you, spit it great
Practicing my gratitude, life is so beautiful
Working on that attitude, just because
(Hook:  Marsha Ambrosius)
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
(Verse 1: Talib Kweli)
Every day I gotta
Trust in God and hustle hard
My grind is real, my hustle dope
I’m finding meals, I’m signing deals
I’m the Gladiator like Russell Crowe
Yeah, you know it’s real, but I’m focused still
Why you focus shake it like gold field
Cause you’re not in tune, no, you’re not immune
No Echinacea, no golden seal
So you sick inside, gotta flush it down
When you talk to folks, cover your mouth
Ain’t nobody gonna cover that shifts
So you go to work, you tuff it down
You bust it out till you’re out for work
I know your boss a jerk, you’re gonna cuss a mouth
Hit it with a bus driver upper-cut
That clock only thing you punchin' out
I relate to you, you gotta pay your dues
When the time is right you gotta make a move
Your job is what you get paid to do
Your call is what you’re made to do
I got faith in you, you’re gonna make it through
Cause you don’t chase money, money chasing you
Keep laboring like you got a baby due
You won’t taste no fruits like Naked Juice
Wo!! The world won't wait for you, you gonna take it now
You gonna make a vow
As long as you on planet earth put family first got to make 'em proud
Hey, let me break it down, oh, bless your hearts
Keep talking bout how stressed you are
Better talk about how blessed you are
(Hook: Marsha Ambrosius)
Lord knows I had it hard today
Had it hard today
Still I gotta keep my head up high along the way
Cause it only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
(Bridge 2:  Marsha Ambrosius)
Every day I got to get up early, wake the kids
Get on running made again
Go to work watching in
Every day I’m hustling
Fight the traffic, lose my cool
Get the kids up at the school
Life it’s hard, yeah, that’s true
This is what I have to do
(Hook: Marsha Ambrosius)
Cause it only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
(Verse 2: Talib Kweli)
Walk with God be still and listen
Try to talk to God what's real I’m spitting
Call 'em Christ by name but he still ain’t rising
Set to my lane but still ain’t listening
Got ice in the veins remain so frigid
Still in the kill brain cells when you hit it
Order pills when you pop that, pop that, pop that
Don’t stop, get it, get it
Started, we the fighters, we survivors but we ain’t living
My soul is blacker than the Friday after Thanksgiving
People of colour 25% more likely than whites to face prison
But just because the president is black there’s no more racism?
Post-racial? More like most racial
The hate for you disgraceful
Don’t let it take you off your base, let it motivate you
Don’t let it overtake you, so what another cloud
Survive the storm by riding on the beasts of the southern wild
Wow
(Hook: Marsha Ambrosius)
Lord knows I had it hard today
Had it hard today
Still I gotta keep my head up high along the way
Cause it only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
Memories live, man, and my memories stay alive..
(more talk)
Heed the battle call, check the catalog
Flow so crazy it's adderall with the padded walls
More twisted turns in the body that's on the baddest broad
These cattle call 'rappers' is weak, my honor matter more
Your whole style stiffer than mannequins you see at a store
You mannequins are Chante & Kenny, I mean the Latter more
No ping pong and we volleying with the back and forth
Straight King Kong and the trap we blasting off, son

You want Nigerian money, see me in Qatar drunk
Waving the K, I can't fake the funk
Blessed with the belts, flying in the stealth
Jewelry on the neck, diamonds in the Cheals
You know I wrestle with pawns, getting my money, we gone
The automatic laying player, we Dons
You can't see us, the new phenoms, I like the Benz zeons
Split your wig like I got three arms
I need a fiancé, at least a Beyoncé
I know my vision beyond some other shit
I'm just as meaty as moms
I'm supposed to be on, the greenery gone
I'm still the king of the drama
Put the Ruger down your throat, eat my Johnson nigga

Way they all in their feelings, what's wrong with niggas
Forgetting silence is still a response
The way the blood paint the wall you can tell he really an artist
I get it like Whitey Bulger 'til rapture, dearly departed
 x2
We gon' Lex in, my nigga
These are blessings, my nigga
Keep stressing, my nigga
Don't stress, little nigga
Eat a clip, little nigga
Niggas trip, little nigga
Violations we gon' flip, little nigga

It's the champion flow, the Jordan, LeBron and Kobe
The Obi Wan Kenobi, of getting that guap-a-mole
We touring overseas, got her fanning out like a Dakota
I'm trying to get the check, I'm Martina Navratilova
Catch me at the races, gateway at Saratoga
They trying to place my face cause we mobbing, we taking over
My niggas keep it pure while you cut with the baking soda
These rappers be stretching the truth like they taking yoga
Couch potatoes, now they made us into a vegetable culture
A result of division like it's a decimal quotient
Do the math, my nigga, do the math
You'd never settle for less than the whole if you knew the half

Rough as alligator skin getting crazy grip
I'm so amazing with words I make a baby spit
Resting in Tibet, wild with the Gillette
Giraffe long goose on, my boots is 
Pocket full of coins, producers on set
Niggas with the coupes is on next
The losers gon' step, the users gon' check
We choosing our ninjas, the Jews is on deck
Refuse, that's a debt, pool with the steps
Everybody see us, the tools is all TECs
Anything come through we school, wan' bet?
Fuck you gon' tell us? He knew we on next

They wanna act like they know me, you don't know me nigga
You got the baby boy hustle, you a Jody nigga
You wanna swim with the sharks, I'm Chief Brody killin'
Get your jaw tapped this is raw rap, come on, yeah
 x2
Take it to the top
Yea, that's where we at with it, hah
Take it to the top
Just cause you are a character, uh
Don't mean you have character
We taking stock right now
You ready? Let's go

A wise man know what he know, and what he doesn't
If he's not really sure what he's saying, he don't discuss it
A righteous man walks the earth without judgment
And loves his enemies enough to deliver justice
A pious man relies on religion for his direction
At times he introspective, but his biblehood never questioned
A dying man will make a confession, try to get into heaven
Thinking his lifestyle is blocking his blessing
A violent man will stock up on weapons and go to war for his
Get post-traumatic stress disorder, become an officer
A man of peace uses his words in different mediums
He'll bleed for his beliefs practicing civil disobedience
An honest man knows only liars are scared of the truth
His word is his bond but his action's always the proof
A faithful man never need evidence to believe
But still he gotta work for the blessings that he receives
Let's go

Sometimes it's hard to believe
In what you don't see or understand
But the picture is so much bigger
Than what we could even imagine
It's hard to feel better
When the weight of the world make you feel sadder
Put your faith into action
Heads up and eyes open

Top tier niggas blossomed in the basement
All the nights that we were lacking those refreshments
Rain down, thunderstorm with the flows
Articulate with the bounce now I'm back like I'm Derrick Rose
Once the one on the bench with the snotty nose
Nefertiti would hold me when I was cold
Communion Sunday, my twenties went in the bowl
Forgive me Lord for them bitches the night before
Business deals and the Bentleys I can't afford
Gotta be the example for children to do their chores
Blowing weed smoke on the cover of The Source
Rolling Stones, on the gone, it was the boss
Fallen soldier on his own so we march
Roll up a bag of that weed, therefore I spark
Recite the Quran, I'm in the dark
Devil knocking on my door, he like a narc

Sometimes it's hard to believe
In what you don't see or understand
But the picture is so much bigger
Than what we could even imagine
It's hard to feel better
When the weight of the world make you feel sadder
Put your faith into action
Heads up and eyes open

No excuses, if I start it then I'll see it through
God is what I see in you so you might as well believe in you
Think what you see on TV's true? The media deceiving you
They misrepresenting, misquoting then they misleading you
Belief is a funny thing, in case you're wondering
If they want the ring, they coming for the throne like they the sons of kings
These average rappers is acting up for the dough
Yeah I tell you what I believe but I back it up with what I know (oh!)
It's the facts versus the facts simile, your raps killing me
My last victory was great moments in Black history
I celebrated with a bottle I just brought back from Italy
And some loud, I got super packs like I backed Hillary
Lost in desire, I walked through the Devil's fire
I inspire the resurrection of kings like Hezekiah
The trust you put in me to be a, beast with this rhyming
That's where the rubber meets the road and where your faith meets science
Let's go

Sometimes it's hard to believe
In what you don't see or understand
But the picture is so much bigger
Than what we could even imagine
It's hard to feel better
When the weight of the world make you feel sadder
Put your faith into action
Heads up and eyes open

Take it to the top, take it to the top
Yeah, yeah, take it to the top, take it to the top
Take it to the top, take it to the top
Check it out baby
Check it out y'all
This that upper echelon shit
What is this?
Welcome to the Prisoner of Conscious

Brainiac dum-dum, bust the scientifical
You feel it all up in your soul, we getting spiritual
You heard I'm coming back, it's so scary I put the fear in you
I murder every track, cause the rhymers like to stare at you
Real shit back, it's a miracle
Rap been laughable over the last year or two
Reflecting like a mirror through who is the real living proof
I'm back with the classical shit, I pack lyrical
Substance like bowls of kush into a vaporizer
And then I vaporize ya', my paper may surprise ya'
No need to brag on my paper cause I'm a naturizer
I vibrate higher, the truth break liars
I chose who is like us
The lovers, the fighters, the writers, the exciters
Cut the grass we could see the vipers
We cut the glass cause we the diamonds


I be listening to real shit, real spit, like die hard feeling
Type of shit the fake niggas find hard to deal wit'
I'm on a higher plane, I'm destroying em' while I build them
My threat can't be contained, so my name on Obama kill list
Kweli the artist that you wanna be
Moving the through darkness, the light is what's in front of me
Front on me you posers exposing your insecurities
Supposedly it's wack and replaces lack of maturity
The purity you need to get in the game is gone
Ain't no conspiracy, stop looking for someone to blame it on
Gotta pay a debt, took a stale style and I made it fresh
Wait a second, got your girl wetter than tomato flesh
Waiting on me with baited breath


Welcome to the
Walking through double fisted, I'm lifted on something vicious
Everything is moving, I'm getting me a percentage
Vintage, nothing but the sky is my ascendant
My girl is ride or die, I'm avoiding the evil temptress
Ain't no question who the best is
You don't like it stay the fuck out of my mentions
Pimping down to the socks, and so is business
The all night workout like 24-Hour Fitness
Y'all niggas is adorable, incorrigible
The praise that you get is barely audible
People is ignoring you, why?
The last place in the world that you belong is a recording booth
Order suit, niggas is gassed up
Petroleum a lab when these niggas get swept up
Custodians of culture, back to the future rap, DeLorean
I class up the joint the spit is valedictorian
Nana-nana-nana ohohoh (status for life)
Nana-nana-nana ohohoh
Nana-nana-nana ohohoh (yeah)
Nana-nana-nana ohohoh (hey, hey)
Nana-nana-nana ohohoh (yeah)
Nana-nana-nana ohohoh (come out)
Nana-nana-nana ohohoh (uh, ay, ay)

Clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap
Clap clap clap clap clap clap for me hey
Clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap
Clap clap clap clap clap, now bring it back

Welcome to the new age where they're thirsty for that Kool-Aid
Thirsty for first in that page, really thirsty just to be fake
Be the first to hate what you say, trying to diss you calling you "gay"
Such an urgent need to express yourself, but really nothing to say
Don't fuck with us, we too tough, get high like you do drugs
Like spit me out I'm chewed up my life is chopped and screwed up
I know you up in this club, I know you don't give a fuck
You told me what you don't like, you made that clear, now what do you love?
There's gotta be more, some live the life of the rich, some people gotta be poor
I've been through a door, I will not sell you a dream, that's what the lottery for
The music is clay, I shaped it, I molded it, like it was pottery or
The mouth with the law, twist it like Robert Duvall, son, the godfather raw
Free as the diamond you found on the floor, I furnished the rhyme with the proper decor
I burnished the nine in my mind with the galore, so they burning with shaman, I'm popping the door
To top it all off, if your style is married to substance, you sound like you got a divorce
That's why I'm blocking and unfollowing y'all, I done forgot what I'm following for
Enough about y'all, now back to me, ain't no academic leave, I'm not faculty
These new slaves ain't ready for my masterpiece, so when they hear me rap it's catastrophe
Cause a casualty so casually they mistake what I do for having beef
I don't actually wish anybody harm, now stretch your arms and clap for me

Clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap
Clap clap clap clap clap clap for me hey
Clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap
Clap clap clap clap clap, now bring it back

Wake up cause no you're not dreaming (yeah), catch up with us cause we leaving (yeah)
Got enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders
I'm looking for some new leaders (ay), I'm looking for some new leaders (uh)
Got enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders
Wake up cause no you're not dreaming (no), catch up with us cause we leaving (yeah)
Got enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)
I'm looking for some new leaders (ay), I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)
Got enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders

Oh lord
Ever since the day I was born, that marks the day I was chosen
To rise above them all and be a leader, I'm like Malcolm X when on the podium
Martin Luther with a dream, Rosa Parks on the bus, though as funny as it seems it remind me of us
Through the money and the fame ain't shit gon' change for the light we adjust
Do it for the children without a ceiling to live up under
Times getting hard, that's why my niggas smoke that tropic thunder
If all our people spreaded love instead of evil
We would prosper our conscious to a level with no equal lethal
Stay true, I gave you my oath, what would the ancient God my nigga Thoth
Through all the books and the screens I was taught, I look at myself and pretend to learn the most
Our leaders dead and gone, what's left for the believers?
If you looking for the truth, one word: Underachievers, nigga

Clap clap clap clap
Clap clap clap for me uh (put your hands together)
Clap clap clap clap
Clap clap clap, now bring it back

Wake up cause no you're not dreaming (wake up), catch up with us cause we leaving (catch up)
Got enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)
I'm looking for some new leaders (ay), I'm looking for some new leaders (uh)
Got enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders
Wake up cause no you're not dreaming (wake up), catch up with us cause we leaving (yeah, catch up)
Got enough followers (ay), I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)
I'm looking for some new leaders (ay), I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)
Got enough followers (what), I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)

As I change the so called predestined course of my life
Advance my shit so now I travel at the speed of light
Moving these intricate insecurities out of sight
Moving myself forward from the darkness into the light
I take flight, it's goodbye to all the negativity
That plague millions of young innocent souls like me
Gave me the genius mind state necessary
To feast off of mother's unlimited figurative tree
Of life, I tried to tell these niggas that our purpose is to move it
Something like Darwin's beliefs of humans in evolutions
As I fall asleep on these social forms of materialism
I wake up and go through more colors than your normal prism
Would you rest my soul, I'm blinding me to a blurry of visions
In light of me on what to cut with such gifted precision
And now I'm truly livin' (bless up, bless up)
And now I'm truly livin' (bless up, bless up)

Wake up cause no you're not dreaming, catch up with us cause we leaving
Got enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders
I'm looking for some new leaders (ay), I'm looking for some new leaders (uh)
Got enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders
Wake up cause no you're not dreaming (no), catch up with us cause we leaving (yeah)
Got enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)
I'm looking for some new leaders (ay), I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)
Got enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)

Nana-nana-nana ohohoh
Nana-nana-nana ohohoh
Nana-nana-nana ohohoh
Nana-nana-nana ohohoh
Nana-nana-nana ohohoh
I see ya, Yeah I see ya
See, I'm lookin right at you, I eye-contact you
You see me, and I'mma be me, Uh
First, I'm sayin Hi, then I'm wavin Bye-bye
We get in, we get in
Girl, you're so fly, you're so fly

Yo, these swallows is horny as Charlie Parker
Be cutting em cause I'm studying these birds like ornithology
Follow em when they tweeting, holler instead of speaking
Give it a name, she played the wicked games every weekend
Broke up with a dude for almost ending her life
Came over for the closure, ended up spending the night
Got cozy in this apartment, wine bottles started popping
Put scratches up on his back, they questioning where he got them
Forgot it was her, she Freddy, her fingers was like machetes
The fucking was so steady, she shredded him like confetti
Confronted him 'bout every single chick, shes like "enough already,"
I need to be with someone else, this stuff is so petty
She was reacting to things he did in the past
This nigga was no saint, he couldn’t say no to ass
Her behavior so rash, she gave up all her power
He put her out on the street, nowhere to live, nowhere to shower
How she gonna make it through the night?
How she's so accepting of her station in life?

She always carrying a baby with her
Her spitting image just like looking at her baby pictures
Her fate is sealed cause she dependent on a man for real
How she running these streets but always standing still?
She need to get up off the hamster wheel
She need to get up off the hamster wheel
How she running the streets but still standing still?
She need to get up off the hamster wheel
She need to get up off the hamster wheel

Battery in the back, popping up with the coppertop
Popular with the ass of the Hottentot
Niggas whooping and hollering at Andromeda when she passing the barber shop
Only job that's an option McDonalds or telemarketer
Hard for her making ends come together, this ain't the Beatles
She needing some anesthesia like she going under needles
She doing so much cutting, its a wonder she bleeding
The money was so seductive, no wonder she ain't leaving
First time she felt like a woman was when a dude screamed
"Nice ass!" out the car window driving past
Nobody showed her how to live so all she do is dream
They call her Rocky cause her makeup is like a mask
 scars permanently lodged on her frontal lobe
Behind bars for credit card schemes she pulled a month ago
First she getting high, now we waving bye-bye
She's waiting out her station just the same
As she's waiting at the station late at night for a train that never came
Moving at the speed of a solution
Bleeding in the streets as we're breathing the pollution
They're saying that we need a revolution
But their passion is reduced to all-caps on a computer
Hey, every sixteen I make a sick scene
Blood splattered all on you shirt like a Miskeen
Y'all niggas trippin' like mescaline and mixed greens
My flow cleaner than the Sistine, pristine
You going green like Al Gore with 'em
I make algorithms that got Malcolm in 'em
God's favorite, I'm sick as a doctor's patient
We live in a cold world, my job is to rock nations
My occupation? Elation, a celebration of rebels
Raise the levels and the decibels flagrant
It's too amazing how we be blazing, son
Our flowers is the loudest, they crowd around us
But cower in the shadows of the towers, boy

Take a tour with it, bake the raw
Where the beats so savage
That it's knuckles gon' scrape the floor
Make a call, all the rocket ships taking off
Jah, Wu, gun music playin' when we facing off

Yo, I plaster the nation, causing evacuation
My manifestation got 'em patient from how I keeps it amazing
See, I'm the reason niggas need some training
While I'm inflicting the pain and making it suitable for any occasion
I'm very engaging soon as I'm awaken
Quickly back you up and bag your bitch
She's reminding me of Sanaa Lathan
Rely on the hating while I'm smiling and waiting
That's when I embrace 'em
If you try to front, you'll be highly mistaken
The mightiest making of a classic, alrighty, I'll face it
My psyche is ancient and I'm hiring, so try me, I'm patient
Sorry, I'm lying, face it, I'm back for the taking
I'm urgently giving niggas the courtesy of smashing their face in
(Damn, can you cut his mic off?)
See how we got 'em buggin'
Cause they can't believe what we have in the making
Shit so historic, got me goin' for it while I bang the nation
And do niggas greasier than a slab of bacon

Bitch, you still cooking this pork in this house?
Stop cooking that damn pork in this house
The hell going on in here?

Take a tour with it, bake the raw
Where the beats so savage
That it's knuckles gon' scrape the floor
Make a call, all the rocket ships taking off
Jah, Wu, gun music playin' when we facing off

These rap niggas is bitches, nothing but suckers to me
Sacrifice myself for the music and let them suffer through me
Your weak product is nothing to me
I only feel effects when I fuck with Louis
Yep, I get buck in the studio like I'm Evil Dee
Pulling strings like the Muppet movie
Shining my light like Mos calling his mother Umi
Who's the hottest regardless of who's flaming?
We ain't talkin' 'bout the best until you mention my name
Who're you kidding? The truest spitting
I'll break you like a mirror so it's clearer
That we don't believe in superstition
These new additions need supervision
Thinking that they can spit it in the booth like me
What are you stupid? Listen
I've been official, it's been official, I'm too consistent
I make a claim cause I'm too official for euphemisms
Staying in the cut like a new incision
I'll put you on your ass like True Religion
So give it up for the truest living

Take a tour with it, bake the raw
Where the beats so savage
That it's knuckles gon' scrape the floor
Make a call, all the rocket ships taking off
Jah, Wu, gun music playin' when we facing off
All the lonely people, where do they all come from?
All the lonely people, where do they all belong?

Yeah I like to go out to clubs
Las Palmas, you know
She this envy if I wanna get grimey wit' it at Bungalow Eight
Opium down in Miami
But when I walk in, I look around and I think

I look at all the lonely people (x4)

Yo, I'm headin' out, 'bout to do some fleshin' out
I know my flesh endowed
With somethin' to prove, I'm settin' out
On a trip to Heaven's mouth, yeah
I'm steppin' out in the name of love
Who knew the Devil could slow dance?
We have pathological romances with technological advance
Infatuated with infatuation and
Intellectual masturbation with premature ejaculation
Make a baby mama's all bastardization and
Lonely people all through the city
They club hoppin' and they love shoppin' and they thug posturin'
Thugs be lockin' horns with Crips on them drug blocks
And them dollars flow right out of the 'hood
When you tryin' to make paper out of the wood
You know that money don't grow on trees
For paper people change colors like leaves
And they fall off in the mud like a filthy pig
Makin' you and your dogs who store all call off
That much deserved ass whippin'
He snitchin', he twitchin', he bitchin', he all soft
Never work with his hands
Little kid on the block who always ran
At all costs, gotta be in the club
Lookin' for happiness or the meaning of love
Then it hit him, out the blue like a vision
All of a sudden he don't like the way he been livin'
And wanna be forgiven
How I know? Cuz I'm right there wit' him
Yo, yo


Tattoos tell 'em who you are
Plastic Surgery coup d'etat the God
Uh, lasers to remove the scar
And then you are, you a supastar, supastar
It's your birthday and you in the club
Talkin' "Holla back" and "Nigga what"
So much cleavage and asscrack
If pussy were a stock it would plummet on the Nasdaq
Blank stares like nobody care
In a room so exclusive nobody there
But really, truth is that nobody there
Cuz it's feelings inside that nobody share
I want God to smile on me
But see, fame is a drug and you wild on E
Celebrities decorated like Christmas trees
God complex like they born on Christmas Eve
Sing a song to yourself and you stand alone
Get nominated for a gold gramophone
Walk the red carpet, left your man at home
Security snatchin' people camera phones
You got rose gold yellow bottles, pink Cashmere
So ahead of the trend, that's so last year
Last month, last day, last hour, last minute
Your pursuit of cool is so passionate
Doin for the cash in it, laugh in his face
If it's def or anybody who don't stay in his place
So popular can't go nowhere, folks stoppin' ya
Might want to check a thermometer
When you go to a movie heat rises
Surrounded by people still lonely, that's why you need disguises
Probably
This the year of the BlackSmith
Talib Kweli, Kwame, let's go
Yeah, niggas don't listen
Back in the days we all used to listen
Now shit is so wack, nobody listen
To that real hip hop, yo, listen

Ladies and gentlemen, get ready, here I come
Talib Kweli and I'm bangin' on ya eardrum
Something I wanna tell you
Now lemme get up in it, wait, wait, wait, wait

Friends, Romans, Countrymen, lend me ya ears
Start repentin' cause the ending is near
But don't panic, you can't function if you livin' in fear
Pay attention, you gotta listen to hear
(Wait just a minute), who the fuck you think talkin' to?
Put you on hold, get a specialist to walk you through
Kweli, the flow captain of fast and slow rappin'
I'm so crackin', you ain't heard? Ya shit appear like closed captions
King of the bars and I'm goin' hard, pause
All my confidence comes from knowin' God's Laws
Bangin' on the system, fightin' my kinda war
Loud as a whisper, quiet as a lion's roar

Ladies and gentlemen, get ready, here I come
Talib Kweli and I'm bangin' on ya eardrum
(Something I wanna tell you)
Now lemme get up in it, it's for ya spirit so
But y'all hear me though
Get up, get into it and get involved
There's a little something that I wanna spit for y'all
(Something I wanna tell you)
Now lemme get up in it, wait, wait, wait, wait

Get it now, get it fast, get it right
Get it big, get it locked, get it done, get it tight
(I think I wanna feel you)
But you don't really hear me though
I spit clearly so it's live outcha stereo
To your heart while it's beatin' in ya chest
When you speakin' to execs and they see behind the desk
To ya spirit, nothing weaker than the flesh
So while you try to keep it fresh, you gettin' deeper into debt
Real hip hop is missin' from the shelf
Yup, it's what you felt when you listen to yaself
Only a few is makin' cuts that's spinnin'
So before you spend ya hard earned spinach

Ladies and gentlemen, get ready, here I come
Talib Kweli and I'm bangin' on ya eardrum
(Something I wanna tell you)
Now lemme get up in it, it's for ya spirit so
But y'all hear me though
Get up, get into it and get involved
There's a little something that I wanna spit for y'all
(Something I wanna tell you)
Now lemme get up in it, wait, wait, wait, wait

You love the sounds comin' out your speaker
I spit rounds like a nine millimeter
The youth today, they frown at the teachers
They ain't down with no leaders
They don't wanna wait (just a minute)
They like, "What? Nigga, wait right there"
I got 'Reservoir Dogs', you'll be missin' a right ear
Get it clear, I figure it's my year
I'm everywhere, makin' appearances in nigga's nightmares
Hear the word, peep the flow, check the cadence
What you heard as a pro, I'm so amazing
Don't front, girl, you know it's ya favorite
New Kweli, yo, they runnin' out of patience

Ladies and gentlemen, get ready, here I come
Talib Kweli and I'm bangin' on ya eardrum
(Something I wanna tell you)
Now lemme get up in it, it's for ya spirit so
But y'all hear me though
Get up, get into it and get involved
There's a little something that I wanna spit for y'all
(Something I wanna tell you)
Now lemme get up in it, wait, wait, wait, wait
Yo, don't it sound so good to you?
It's the return of the greatest, y'all
Talib Kweli, BKMC
BlackSmith is the movement, BlackSmith is the music
Whatchu ridin' for?
Whatchu livin' for?
Whatchu dyin' for?
(I think I wanna feel you)
Bangin' on ya eardrum, yeah
Wait now, wait now, wait now for a minute
Listen
Wait now, wait now, wait now for a minute
No matter what the obstacle is, we fight through it
To survive is only half the battle, we won't lose it
So have faith in better days on the way
I lend my hand to you, whenever you need me I'll stay
I understand sometimes, the world is type cloudy
But like a plane that's over the game, we fly out it
Determination, dedication til the end
I'm there every step of the way, until we win
Cause I believe in prayer, in God Almighty
Get them burdens off your shoulder, send them to the highest
But we can beat it, overcome the lows
Being positive is key, you believe and it shows
I spread awareness, be mindful of your health
Be here for one another so you never by yourself
One step at a time, one time for the cause
I rep it for the world, I rap it for us all

Don't run away from who you are
Life's beautiful (life is beautiful)
Pick yourself back on up
Life's beautiful (life is so beautiful)

This the highway of life, we stay driven
Then at some point, you arrive at a decision
To fly high, we weather any condition
We doing more than surviving because we living
The music feel good -- yes sir, it'll satisfy you
Like a meal would, real good when it's going down
It's the flavor that you savor when you wait
It tastes great -- compliments to the chef, he got taste
Clean your plate, clear the music in front of a glass of water
Taking stale pictures, see the crystals forming
The horns make me feel victorious, the keys make me feel glorious
The drums make me feel like a warrior
The track feel big, Notorious
Do it for the people feeling trapped in the corridor
Nobody know what you're going through in a day
But don't let yesterday ruin today
And they say..


They say it's all for the money, but I don't wan' believe it
I'm a man of my word, so whatever you been hearing
Is the truth -- flatline, polygraph, that's me
We could all use a break -- spare of Apache
Catch me crossing items off my bucket list
Cause life is good as you want it to get
I paint a different portrait with any color I find
The canvas is the world and the brush is my mind
I don't mind stepping out my comfort zone
I think the greatest fear is the one of the unknown
If you afraid of living and you afraid of death
Then I'm afraid you'll never take a step to the left
Or the right direction
Tonight's confession -- I used to be scared of my own reflection
And what would really happen if I fought that vision
But the matter all along -- if it's not good, it's gone
Nowadays we be rocking glasses for fashion
And fucking with life a fraction
Covered in Max Factor, hustling ass-backwards
As sure as Hi-Tek look like Richard from Last Dragon
Your focus on bogus rappers got you caught up in distraction
Distraction. Who fucking who? Who cares? That's distraction
You wish it was you, don't you -- why you asking?
Try to break the law of attraction
Get a piece of my attention like a fraction of a ration
Or a measly little morsel
They suck your blood and you believe in the immortals
We nocturnal like a sleeping disorder
See the water drawing away from the shore
This ain't no ordinary storm
We killing for a humanitarian cause
But have yet to show up in Darfur
The Arab Spring is what it's called
But it's looking at the pride before the fall
They say it ain't about the spoils of war
But turn around and tell you how much more the oil will cost
Steal the land from the Native American and call the missiles Tomahawks
Make him a mascot, dress up like him for sport
As a final assault to his beautiful culture
Scavengers, feasting on the dead like a vulture
Snacking; how you keeping up with my rapping?
You barely keeping up with Kardashians
You caught up in distraction
It's the living proof -- you try to make the truth elastic as Mr. Fantastic
We recycling these rappers
Truthfully, these niggas is plastic
Coming through the front door blasting
I ain't talking bout them e-mails
That you always send to the masses
That somehow end up in my trash bin
My niggas got the aim of sharpshooters and the hearts of assassins
All this war, all this life, all this passion
The game is distraction
Give a fuck if the President wear a flag pin
Rhyming is deep as holes Chilean miners are trapped in
Or the cracks in the earth under Asia Minor causing disasters
My deep cuts way above your minor infractions
Talk to rappers like children cause that's how they acting
They holding their hands like minors in traffic
The captains of industry and the lovers of status quo
Have a deep-seeded fear of change
For them it's strange -- they wanna go
Back to the 50's, they asking for a return
But them days is much blacker, for lack of a better term
We adapted to the times, but this culture we had to learn
Came about as natural as a perm on a pachyderm
These fascists have had their turn
We packing them German burners, them Lugers
The next shooters waiting for Superman, they get nothing but Lex Luthor
America's nightmare, vivid as Fred Kruger
Our heroes are dead to us
Spirit that bled through us
Endear us with the spirit so the flow is so foolish
What you hearing is precision
The people so thirsty, what they seeing is mirages
But this passion Photoshopping and your YouTube collages
Coming through like Collossus
Exposing the false prophet
Taught how to do the knowledge so I'm never off-topic
A lie is like a potion
First it gets you open
Then you swallow whole straight for the truth
Fuck the chaser, skip religion and the politics
And head straight to the compassion
Everything else is a distraction
Chorus:
She's got a ticket I think she gonna use it
Think she gone to fly away
(Where you going?)
No one should try and stop her
Persuade her with their power
She says that her mind is made
Spoken: This a story we all familiar with
Verse 1:
Yeah we all tryin to live worry free
Pretty young things affection is like currency
Talking bout a country girl living in a city though
Searching but she get her moral compass from these videos
Girl you'll be killing and searching your faith or new tears
Courage under fire especially after a few beers
Already broke the resolution for a new year
They blushin cause they sayin it's nothing inside a few years
Until I came across this dame I used to baby sit
At the club looking for this lame she had a baby with
Wait a minute you're only 17 and she said to me
My baby gave me strength to leave the city life ain't meant for me
Father can't be bothered, I'm here to make my peace
So offered her some money but she started quoting Jay to me
I'll do you one better, I slay these niggas faithfully
I don't need you to pay for me, I just need to pray for me
Chorus:
She's got a ticket I think she gonna use it
Think she gone to fly away
(Where you going?)
No one should try and stop her
Persuade her with their power
She says that her mind is made
Verse 2:
When you call up and captain say that ain't no hero
What you really bring to the table let's keep the real dough
No matter where you're going if you don't get your mind right
First choose between two evils like this is Twilight
She up in the kitchen tonight cooking the grams up..
Gotta take you to right the Peter Pan but
She gotta take it to..she got a grant..
She gotta take it to fly she had a lan and she try
She tryin to avoid the trap is like the cancer
The love of money run in her vein, now she a dancer
Now the blow go in her nose to keep her dancin'
The high is the only escape, she like a phantom
A ghost just a sell of herself packing them pasttense
Closer to selling herself, using her assets
Ain't nothing left to shake let's break it all down
Got it inside her veins, she takin' off now

Fly high, fly fly
Sky high, yeah
Hole up, where you're going girl
Where you're going, hole up
Where you're going girl
Where you're going, hole up
Where you're going girl
Where you're going, hole up
Where you're going, damn
Verse 3:
Damn, I'll found her later that she don't know who her father was
I’m like this crazy, a baby ain’t got no starter kit
She never met the real..foe they tried to steal her goodies
They breakin' into her candy store
We holdin' pistols and Willy Wonka for soulja sistas
Cause when we're taking the gold and taking the coldest winter
Statistics will give you the truest picture of the youth
The visionary’s on a mission for new beginnings
It’s hard enough when you radiate a twenty block radius
Wondering who the father of the baby is
To pay relationships to her like sound fiction out to table
And public you write a buy you and provide it with the title
Body of a woman with the eyes of a child
Driven that she could..is it now
Want her future to be as bright as a smile
She like I see her spinning that Wheel of Fortune, let’s buy a vowel

Hole up
I realized early that black girls carry universes inside their bodies
Waiting to be named whole continent
Land masses that were once connected
Flow through her arms fingers, chest, legs, stomach
Feet and head
Ghanna is her heart, her lungs charity
Her tongue I'm.., her bones massai
Her breath Aboriginal her skin the color of Moroccan
Sand in south african sky lines
Her blue blood separates the land fro our riversand great legs
The place where we shit and drink
The place that we love and hate
Colonize and liberate
Conquer and rebuilt right and so up
Escape and imprisoned
The place where questions like if you a woman
Raise your hand will get you killed
 + (Talib)
Deliver us, deliver us (Yeah)
Deliver us, deliver us (What? Yeah)

And what the people say? We wanna live it up
And what the people want? Please deliver us
And what the people need? Hey...
I got that, yeah

I call these rappers baby seals, cause they club you to death
I could call 'em Navy SEALs, cause they government feds
What become of the vets? They drugged up, they fucked up, they in debt
There ain't no love and no respect, it's like a gang it's like a club or a set
Hip-Hop's the new WWF
What do you rap or do you wrestle? Niggas love to forget
We got til it's gone, you think you on, you still hustlin backwards
Your topical norm a tropical storm, it's a fuckin disaster
Back to the topic we on, it all started at Rawkus
They couldn't find the words to describe me so they resort to the shortcuts
Is he a backpacker? Is he a mad rapper?
An entertainer? or the author of the last chapter?
We living in these times of love and cholera
Synonymous with the apocalypse, look up the clouds is ominous
We got maybe ten years left say meteorologists, shit
We still waitin for the Congress to acknowledge this!
 & (singers in the background)
What the people want? Please deliver us
We wanna live it up, please deliver us
Th-th-this is the, th-th-this is the, this is the hostile gospel
I'm reaching through the fire - please deliver us
I'm preaching to the choir - please deliver us
Just keep it real with us, you scared to spill your blood
Your words rung hollow, we need someone to follow

You ain't promised tomorrow, so get your paper up
You can't always just borrow and asks for favors bruh
Stand on your own two, never covet thy neighbor's stuff
Karma's a bitch so watch your mouth and what you sayin bruh
I start a conversation based on general observation
Hip-Hop is not a nation, take it to population
Niggas got a lot to say when locked inside the belly of Satan
Awaitin trial debatin how the hell I got placed in this system
Am I a victim or just a product of indoctrination?
They exploit it and use me like a movie with product placement
You hear the congregation; this is the hostile gospel
The truth is hard to swallow it'll leave you scarred tomorrow
Keep it honest our motto, these niggas keep it bottled
I'm the writer who reach the fighters like speeches by Cus D'Amato
DJs stickin to vinyl like "Fuck Serato"
Suppliers who ride around the block, in the custom autos
Ballin like the struck the lotto you know who the cleanest is
A nigga keep it reeich with the stitch and greedy geniuses
I'm not a hipster, but I flip it like a sneaker pimp
Expose the game, treat it like a bitch
Smack fire out these hoes, cause they snitch and tap wires while I plead the fifth
You can't trust a soul in the biz, so be careful who you eatin with
And sleepin with and also who you chiefin with
You never know they might've added in secret ingredients


Freedom's a road that's seldom traveled, watch hell unravel
Right before the eyes of the soldier who fell in battle
The single mother who raised her daughter to bear the sacred water
And not take the hand of every man who make a offer
To black kids wishin they white kids, when they close they eyelids
Like, "I bet they neighborhood ain't like this"
White kids wishin they black kids, and wanna talk like rappers
It's all backwards it's identity crisis
The industry inside us is vipers with fangs trying to bite us
Drug suppliers is the health care providers
We cakin, makin narcotics outta household products
We ain't workin out 'til we exorcise the demons that's inside us
Plus they seem to just provide us with enough rope to hang ourselves
Enough dope to slang ourselves, enough toast to bang ourselves
It's officially nigga season, these niggas is bleedin
That's why I'm spittin freedom we had enough of trigger squeezin


In these tryin days and times
All I need is to be free
I can't do it on my own
Lord can you deliver me?
There are trials still to come
It's salvation that I need
So I'm reachin to the sky
Lord can you deliver me?
Deliver us...
Deliver us, yeah
Deliver us, ohhhhhhhhhh
Oh, deliver us
Deliver us
Ohhhhh Deliver us yes
Deliver us, deliver us, deliver us
Yeah yeah yeah, ohhhhhhhhhh... {*ad libs to fade*}
You are now witnessing the demise of the music business
I say demise of the music business cause people always gonna need music in they life
You know what I'm saying?
I can't do music with people I'm uncomfortable with
You know what I'm saying?
I can't be on stage with you pouring out my soul if I don't like you
So with that said, shout out to Strong Arm Steady
Shout out to Jean Grae
That's my Blacksmith family, you dig?

I just heard a song that reminded me of times when you was finding me
Rhyming in Greenwich Village circa 1993
Yeah, those was the salad days, my career's appetizer
The main course a casserole, a jambalaya
Of different influences that led me where the music is
A student is only as good as his teachers' tutelage
Paying for college, not learning was straight foolishness
So I stopped going to school but this was
Hard to tell my parents -- sat them down, tried to get through to them
Started flowing daily and traveled to different places
Freestyled with Clef and Forte in the Booga Basement
With Rubix and Juju on Flatbush, my hood amazing
Platinum Island recording with Duro and Just Blaze
And that was right next door to Rawkus -- what's up, Jarret and Brian Blackshaw?
And Matt Fingaz; Kendra Ross, you got the soul of a Stax singer
I love how you always bring it back, sister
You and Reesy making every record
I got classics with Hi-Tek and Mos Def that are so respected
Shout out to Corey Smyth, shout out to Dave Chapelle
I went on tour with The Roots, they played so well
Writing rhymes with Myka 9
Me and Pharoahe Monch were Soundbombing
Me and Lonnie Lynn got a lot in common
Mystik Journeymen introduced me to Top Ramen
On the bus, Kanye West would never stop rhyming
Ain't no mountain high enough for him, he never stopped climbing
That's why when the homies win, I never stop smiling
See I'm smiling right now

Nothing else matters more than friends and family
No doubt, that's how its gotta be
This is my odyssey, it's just the God in me
Friends and family
Yup, they all a part of me
Cause I would die for them and they would die for me
Friends and family
That's right, and plus I love my fans
Love when you throw your hands up -- it's like you all my fam
Friends and family
Like you considered kin
Got me through thick and thin, thank you for listening
Nothing else matters more than friends and family

It started with a blast, now I'm a iconoclast
Promise to be honest in my craft and make the promise last
I do this for myself, but the song for you
Once I put it out for sale then it belong to you
This for Amani Fela plus Diyani Eshe
Your daddy love his girl, your mother never far away
This is for Eque, this for Kierra Paul
We wanna ride like Ciara and we will never fall
HeadCquarterz and Guru is love forever y'all
Make it plain cause its too strong for a metaphor or simile
Your legacy will always be remembered for forever or
Til the end of time whichever come first
Big love to my mom and dad -- you could have done worse
Jamal and I the way we are cause you put your sons first
Many black parents lose they sons to the gun burst
Mommas drowning in they own tears til they lungs burst
Voice cracking like Michael Stipe cause everyone hurts


First record was with Mood back in '96
In fact, it was pretty fresh -- Google that, find that shit
It sound good; I was showing you what timeless is
You couldn't catch what I was saying without rewinding it
Believe me, every fan is special
You hear me now but I got fans from Lyricist Lounge and "Manifesto"
So much wack rap, I know its hard to tell the difference
But when I heat it up I make the garbage smell
I'm resurrected but I'm no savior
I know the game, I can ball a little bit -- I'm an OK Player
Double meaning cause the flow is layered
We love to say it but its easier than it sound to ignore the haters
To snap back like the jaws of gators
Been around the world many times
Seen many things
And they in color too
Seen women so beautiful
That I could die with a smile on my face
And not feel like the good lord gypped me
(The space between love and me
Between...)

How you expect to have an ordinary relationship
With such an extraordinary nigga
Yea there's flaws in what you figured
Ain't the liquor that got you considering calling up the sitter
Telling her you need a couple hours and of course you tip her
I like my fantasies, half stripper half glass slipper
Wrappin' one like a riddle with enigma
Character in my flip book
Coming to life when I'm flipping through the pictures
Switching up the positions
My karma karma chameleon
Change colors with the surroundings
I can hear you with my eyes and I'm loving the way you sound
And I'm smothering and I'm grindin'
Now doubt is counting me out
Loving in public when we coming and
Up against the cupboard til we...
(Look like turquoise)
Right on the couch
(Yellow on the bad day)
Knocking it out without a doubt

(Colors of you)
'Eyo the world is my coloring book
Look, new discoveries every time
When I color outside the lines
(Colors of you)
'Eyo the world is my coloring book
Look, new discoveries every time
When I color outside the lines

(Color of you)
My self expression
Acquire every color in the spectrum
My self reflection make the light change direction
When you see it from this angle the colour, the cut the clarity
Starts bringing me down that's the depravity of gravity
Having me in my blue phase
Go off the grid for a few days
Go on a journey without a suitcase
The security of obscurity in a world of respect
And I'm trading it like a currency
Currently you soft as a mallet hitting a xylophone
He so yella I'm wishin' his fella right his wrong
But naw, instead he is synthetic as styrofoam
Recite a poem so monotone that they monochrome
My light'll poke through the clouds
We'll take you higher like you smoking the loud
While I provide the dope kaleidoscope of sound
You can see it with your ears
You can hear it with your eyes
You can feel it right here yea

(Colors of you)
You don't look like turquoise
You don't look like gold
You don't look like purple
That'll match your hue

'Eyo the world is my coloring book
Look, new discoveries every time
When I color outside the lines
(Colors of you)
'Eyo the world is my coloring book
Look, new discoveries every time
When I color outside the lines
(Colors of you)
(Colors of you)
This the high life
Call it my life

This is the byproduct of beautiful love
Fit like a glove, what's good, my people I think we could
Get it you know we should, hold it like it’s a grudge submerged
But I just surf

I’m renting the universe
But the stars don’t fit and my bars are too mega
Is the fruit of my labor, my plate is full of color
Arugula and rutabaga share the food with my neighbor
Truly innovative like Fela Kuti and Ginger Baker

Moon raker, sun scraper, will give you fire for the papers
Take you higher on the vapors
Sire of the flavor, designer of the caper
Executive executor direct when I'm on path
Flight without navigator, plight of a savior

Now what would Jesus do?
How you believe in Him? You don’t believe in you
The idea that you doubting I'm unbeatable
Vizzini in the princess bride - inconthievable
These MCs is eatable, wait - edible
I’m fishing with dynamite, now I got a freezer full
Of rappers, bastards I'm ten steps ahead of you
Incredible, give credit where credit due

Put passion into action
Mashing on the gas where them others they be maxing
Accelerate, generate, power with my pen and pape'
Stimulate, you simulate, you do what I incinerate

We do it for the dinner plates, musical we innovate
You imitate, your theory full of holes and so we ventilate
Damn it, never gonna say they love what we doing on stage
Even if they don’t one quote and the hate just integrates

They feel us like shade, you know we’re feeling great
Not a script that is writ', this is how originals spit
It's an unconventional gift, kwe we interpolate
Them others be herbin' it, the praise, we deserving it

Word, I love songs, writing to right wrongs
Continue to fight on, I’m putting the gloves on
I love horns, I'm loving this damn track
I’m loving the hand clap, it's the clap, clap
Loving it when you listen
"Love will fix it" said Ashford and Simpson (That's right)
Living for the drums and the slums, some of the best parts
The tourists never come, they run when it gets dark

Yeah, so in my idle space, they're funny like them bridal maids
Booking like we’re playing spades, yeah, we always make the grade
FSC to get a fade, Valencia then to the Haight
Sucka free I’m in my space, say I’m hella steezy, yeah (yee)
Believe I get a so in, streaking like a Martin
Sunny in Dolores, bike parking
Fly chick's sparking
Then we up the road to the Phoenix some steady bar hopping
There's high life everywhere, Tony Allen rhythm is
Pattern that we living in, Kweli on his business
Everywhere we deep in this, shawty’s gon' be speaking it
Oh, they so uniquely spit

The great debater, the saviour, the caped crusader
The alpha, the omega, your favorite communicator
News junky I’m debunking the myth of the job creators
Departed the conversation that started indoctrination
The flow is a thing of beauty, I’m bringing it as my nudey
You drinking it like a smoothie, they're spinning it like a sufi
Rappers, I dissect 'em, collecting 'em like a souvie
Near they’re acting up I'm directing 'em like a movie
Skip the drama, this an action-adventure
They so freaking soft it should be against the law
Illegal tender
And yo, do I really need to mention
This is the high life

High life, high life
High life, high life
Cause we be living the high life, high life
High life, high life
Yes, I’m living in the high life, high life
High life, high life
Cause I’m living the high life, high life
Around my way...
Around my way...
All the corners filled with sorrow
All the streets are filled with pain
Around my way...

People let me paint a picture
You know I ain't a Christian
I ain't a Muslim, ain't a Jew
I'm losing my religion
I speak to god directly
I know my god respect me
Cause he let me breathe his air and he really blessed me
I ain't knocking you, but I don't fuck with hospitals
Spit the gospel, truly knowing jesus like apostles do
Return like the prodigal son to honor Mohammed too
Stay away from ham like Abraham, Lord I follow you
Even when you took my man Chaka God and what I'm a do
You gave the hood a modern day martyr in Brother Amadou
I'm on the block, I'm tracing your footsteps, I keep the faith in you
Your love, plus hard work and ambition
We gonna make it through, my songs is psalms I'm spiritual when I'm lyrical
This is for my soldier niggas looking in the mirror who
Sitting home scratching off serials eating cereal
The way we find a way to survive, shit is a miracle
We got mice in the crib and roaches in the toasters, rice in the fridge
Bread in the oven by the roaster
We be takin' gypsy cabs and chasin' 50 bags
They be laced with shitty swag and it really get me mad
The way we saluting flags, wrapping them around our heads
When niggas ain't become American till 9/11
Feeling like you gotta sneak into heaven
When the reverend looking like a pimp and the pimp look like the reverend


These conditions make us strong
And we create our own businesses so later on
Our children have things in their name that they can say they own
A mix tape freestyle become your favorite song
No place like home when the cops ask you about your neighbors
Beat on you, threaten to incarcerate you
Till you spill your guts like you a Garcia Vega
We roll blunts not the papers
Cop the greatest take it coast to coast
L.A. to Chicago like Smooth Operators
Cop the Dro and cop the blacks
Cop the four, cock it back
Drop the flow, rock a hat on top a stocking cap
Be a doctor or a lawyer or make your momma a promise that
You'll finish school, but when you got a dream you gotta follow that
And make sure when you make it out the hood, you always holler back
Think about what you got from that
And always put your dollars back
On top of that, this is a legacy and we a part of that
The hood is where my heart is at
Catch me around my way
And nature's game once more begins

Here we go like, yes yes ya'll
To the beat ya'll
Ain't no sleep ya'll
To the break of dawn
Five o'clock in the morning
We keep rockin' on
The workin' people runnin' like the stop clock is on
We got it poppin' in the meat market
Chicks take a seat, park it
By the bar so they can meet the vic with deep pockets
And them dudes buy them cars and turn 'em in to sweet objects of desire
Big rims and them tires
We finna drop it like it's heavy as hell
The Clan of the Cavebear
Used to use the club to hit and drag her by the hair
Still use the club to get her a martini or a beer
Try to get her home and put the smell of sex in the air
Come through like the Cable Guy
Get 'er done
That 'ole hit 'n run
Turn 'em into bitter ones
Tonight is catch me if you can
You can taste the ginger bread
Ain't nothin' like wakin' up with a stranger in your bed, nope

Soon the new day breaks the dawn
Tomorrow I'll be like
Were am I, what's your name
Gotta go, I'm glad you came
But tonight you will be so fun
Maybe you're the one
Soon the new day breaks the dawn

Putting on some Airs
King For a Day
Hard to face your fears we wear the mask like Claude McKay
You have a ball today
It's all a masquerade
Shorty paint her face like a clown but can't take away the frown
Found under the make-up
I asked her, what's your passion
Answered, what's the paper
She sleepin' and they don't want her to wake up
Maybe then she'll realize her own beauty
Baby, you a star and not just a star on some dude's home movies

Steppin' out, I got my best outfit on
Gotta get it in
I'm slippin' in the darkness like most of the day is gone
We up all night I wonder if can hang
We used to hang from a tree, now we hang behind the rope, we V.I.P
We do it B.I.G
Ain't no need to see I.D
The entire scenery shrouded in mystery
Clouded with greenery
Six girls to every three dudes
So you have half a chance if you ask to have a dance
The ones ready to freak off don't need no romance
They belong to the sisterhood of the traveling pants
They got them hungry eyes you know sensual trance
At a glance the alcohol got you sexually advanced
The truth is so boring you gotta pretend a little
The antidote is more colorful the rainbow that end in Skittles
And the quest to trap the cat
The game is your Tender Vittles to get the bruce to say the sky's fallin
Like you Chicken Little, come on
These times it's hard being a man. I try to explain that to my lady overtime

My girl is a delicate flower, a super-hero
Being a single mom helped develop her powers
We stay up to a elegant hour talking inhaling the sour
Reaching out to God cause the Devil a coward
But he still sits on my shoulder and whispers
It feels like my shoulder gets colder the more that I listen
And now it seems like she ready to leave
We stay to beef the main reason my desire to spreading my seed
I try to tell her I'm just a man
She said "no, you're wrong
Cause you're way more than that
You need to cut the scam
You're not fooling me, this lunacy
Them excuses might be new to the birds
But they ain't new to me."
Yo, I hate when the fit is thrown
It's like everytime I pick up the phone you bitch and moan, whoa
I'm like why you stressing for?
I'm pressing ignore, make me wanna never get involved

I need to reap these benefits
Ooh, you so sensitive
I say serve this royalty
She say I deserve your loyalty
Girls have feelings

Men lie out of fear but we front like we're not afraid
Whether arguing or not, the bills gotta get paid
We are not in 6th grade, we're fighting and people watching
On Twitter she emo-blogging, I'm boiling her hemoglobin
It lead to sobbing the arguments never move me
Cause we acting out the stereotypes like Tyler Perry movies
My indiscretion is reeking in deep betrayal
Libidos are like horses, it's hard to keep em stable
She believed me the way Mike believed in Fredo
But I need her, she the proof in my soul, my sweet potato
Before I let her go I know she'll be forever gone
I can't leave when the weather wrong I weather storms
She like Katrina got me looking for FEMA
Coveting my neighbor's lawn the grass is looking greener
But in reality it never is
I'm sure there's others, but I'll never find a better fish
Girls have feelings
Girls have feelings
Girls have feelings
They surely, surely do
(Verse)
I switch lanes; it's still blurry, then switch frames
Clowning these lames -- you're Bill Murray in Quick Change
Control your mission, keep up with my pole position
Brag it about the ride you're whipping, your soul is missing
Racing to your death or the holiest celebration
God bless our lady of holy accelerate
Cuz we speeding while we drive on this highway of information
The devil try to deny us the highest of elevation
They keep us at sea level so I’m staying on my A game
They local like the C when I express like the A train
My a-alikes take what I write, use it to maintain
We be alike and see alike, cause we got the same brain
We in the same chains, work in the same fields
Now we’re independent, you can keep your fucking lame deal
Total package, the flow is mastered, I'm blowing past the procrastinators
So fast, it's like they going backwards
(Hook)
Life’s so short, we can’t afford to lose
When the guns go off and the flag drops
I’ll never stop
I'mma race to the finish line of the road
To kick in the door
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
(Verse)
They hate when I give 'em some straight they need chase
Half these little boys coming faster than speed racer
Pulling capers with my team best believe I’ll be seeing paper
With extraordinary gentlemen, trust me the league major
On the highway of life I’m faster than cop cars
Quicker than the tongues of the rappers that got bars
Never rattled cause we been through the battles, we got scars
This the international half of the Black Star
This is the sound that you’re missing I’m here when your ears listen
Play it loud in your whip when you're dippin your gear shifting
Gifted like the island of the misfit toys, ladies apply like the lipstick.
Boys take over when the shit drop
Boys wanna holla at birds like Alfred Hitchcock
Men wanna talk to the women, we ain’t screaming
Just whisper in their ear and we're leavin
(Hook)
Life’s so short, we can’t afford to lose
When the guns go off and the flag drops
I’ll never stop
I'mma race to the finish line of the road
To kick in the door
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
(Bridge)
When it’s gone to the wire
I gotta win to the fire
You can’t stop it. No, you can’t stop it
Because I’m destined to win
Like a full champion
And we know it’s happening
At the time, get ready, set, go
(Verse)
On your mark, get set, when I start the jet
Look how far I get, I’m not only an artist they say
One is the loneliest number but still regardless
The second best don’t exist, it’s a little oxymoronic
What a thought, listen to haters and never buy to hitting high
Watermarks, cause the market’s flooded with garbage
You are now embraced by the light with fiber optic
Shine it bright love, get a ten or wind tropic
Prisoner of conscious, nonsense
I can say the conscious is asleep, I prefer the call of the wake
It’s so ironic, it’s beautiful when you finally get awake at your funeral
We don’t get it away
Rappers nowadays are confusing you
I know you’re tired of the usual like Trey Songz and Drake
That’s why I’m leaping the faith, keeping the pace
Although it’s all about the winning, it’s never about the wait
(Hook)
Life’s so short, we can’t afford to lose
When the guns go off and the flag drops
I’ll never stop
I'mma race to the finish line of the road
To kick in the door
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
It's a brand new day
If you passionate about what you do like I'm passionate about this music
This song is for you
It's like I can't breathe
When I wake up in the morning I can't breathe
Until I listen
Feed my family
I affect the world
And y'all along for the ride

Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my heart, my music
Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my life, my music

I'm from a small city, but I have big dreams
Had some good ideas, but I had better schemes
I thought the hustle way for me was etched in stone
Until my partner died and name etched in stone
My daughter's growing up, my son on the way
They closing in on me, it feel like any day
Music saves me, swooped in like the navy
Put a lifetime of scars all in sixteen bars
So I took the vow and made music my life
Yep, I proposed and made music my wife
And if ever need to cut a nigga music's my knife
And if I need to bring the girls together music's my dyke
So if I degrade it and I hate it, even cried through it
I watch brothers prophesise about dying through it
Music gave me knowledge of self
And I'm a knowledge-ous self, then gave me knowledge of wealth

Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my heart, my music
Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my life, my music

Music a part of me, I'm a bully
Beating up the track with brutal honesty
The truth inside of me, rappers hit the booth and they lie to me
I'm using the inspiration guru provided me
The redefining of space, you can call me the new geometry
A picture of you pop up when I google monotony
Now all the people who rule and spend responsibly
Think your album is trash and it's not the voodoo economy
So you expecting the conscious and introspective views
Eat your lyrical vegetables, let me tell you what’s best for you
My music give you a message true and respect is due
But music is emotion that’s lost on the intellectuals
A tree fall in the forest is never heard
Amongst the sparrows and the robins and even the ghetto birds
You download it for free but what I create is sacred
It cost you nothing but I pay to make it, trust me

Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my heart, my music
Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my life, my music

I was born on the afterbeat
I'm like Robert Johnson
When you reach the crossroads
Me and the devil have to meet
It's all the same thing as clever Lauryn when they saw it Lauryn went
Looking for God and 'Clef kept tourin'
We listen to the same songs but we hear them different
Serenade of death like we got a fear of living
Having a seance on stage cause the spirit risen
Stop the devilish ways with clever displays of lyricism
These songs are a natural resources of actual street stories
Attract the police forces
Slaves to the rhythm the masters they eat off us
Remember, whatever discipline you’re in, whether you’re a musician or a photographer, a fine artist or a cartoonist, a writer, a dancer, a singer, a designer — whatever you do, you have one thing that’s unique: You have the ability to make art. Sometimes life is hard. Things go wrong — in life and in love and in business and in friendship and in health. And when things get tough, this is what you should do. Make good art

This about to be the realest shit you ever heard
I lynch rappers, got them hanging on my every word
These bitch rappers be claiming they slinging heavy word
Really snitch rappers, niggas singing like every bird
Rich rappers, nah, I don't know them niggas
Niggas don't get rich rapping, they selling clothes or liquor
My flow is sicker cause I flow with vigor
I'm no beginner, peep the whole agenda
Control my center cause I gravitate with Gravitas
This my inner monologue
Burning down your party cause our cocktails is molotov
My crime mob make you stop, lock and drop, don't get wollywop'd
Actually battery in my back like a copper top
Got it popping, started on the B-side of Body Rock
Direct to fan, I'm running my shop like my mom and pop
Modern day slavery today to be an artist, watch
They treat them like a product and try to mount like a hot 'n tot
Molly pop, niggas not caring if they body rot
Partying like Mardi Gras, get the cream like Häagen-Dazs
Golly gosh, this is Utopia, cornucopia
I'm known to start revolts against the Romans like Zenobia
Hoping to keep coping copious amounts of opiates
Tried to start a union, but they blocked me like a Soviet
I hope they get it, I'm sick of explaining history
I'm rolling with a circle of winners, we claimin' victories
It ain't a mystery, the hate'll make it bittersweet
They hate when I engage to debate 'em like Wale's Twitter feed
Who I'm kidding? I'm the great debater
My crew stay winning, we stay innovating
Your circle is rotten as great tomatoes
They get high with you then start dry snitching like Jose Canseco
Prosecco, I'm sipping vino with a vivid hue
Haberdasher rocking Borsalinos like Hasidic Jews
Pitiful, rappers never stand up to the ridicule
That's why I had to get at you
Wear it if it fit the shoe, nigga
(Baby, just shine your light
If you've gotta dim yours, so they can shine brighter
Just stay bright, so shine your light)

We're in a transitional world right now because the nature of distribution is changing. The distribution channels that people have built over the last century or so are in flux. The print, the visual artist, the musicians... which on the one hand intimidating and on the other, immensely liberating. The rules, the assumptions, the now-we're-supposed-tos  of how you get your work seen and what you do then, they're breaking down. The gatekeepers are leaving their gates. You can be as creative as you need to be to get your work seen. The old rules are crumbling. And nobody knows what the new rules are, so make up your own rules
Peace, peace, everything we do is a creation
In complete harmony, our creation becomes art
Everything we've ever invented stems from the human imagination
Everything we've ever invented or created
That moved an era is recognized as work of genius
Science and the empirical man, philosophy and the thinker
Religion and the shaman, art and the sick who can metabolize
Everything with a trace of decay is human error
Forgivable human error the curse
From the radiance of the gift which becomes shadow
Necessary evil so to speak, or we'd have figured it out by now
Striving for perfection is a result of genius
Find peace, share your genius
See I can't see my own face without a reflection
Whether it be your reaction to my expression, a mirror or water
I need the outside to know the inside which is where I reside
Through this understanding, I know that all things are one
According to science, everything is a wave of energy
A soundwave reaches my ear and my mind makes something of it
My eyes are receptors for another type of energy
Which my mind then depicts as images, same goes for smell and touch
Time and space are tools which help me concretize these waves into information
Now when given full attention to something other than time and space
Time and space disappear, I'm simply doing
Yesterday, tomorrow, here, there, poof!
It is always now, all is energy
Even thoughts are forms of energy waves floating
Technically I'm only a vessel channeling those thoughts
My mind chooses to tune into these frequencies
Which I either contemplate or share with the outside
I believe we all function with the same foundation
Energy, which is everything
Everything is one big ocean of energy
Everything is within you, everything is you
The identity of me is but a series of memories
In which my mind decides to narrate in order to create that feeling
Remember it is always now
The first law of thermodynamics states that energy is conserved
In other words, energy can neither be created or destroyed
Energy only transforms
We are thus forever, and death is but a blink
So I ask why hurt? Why kill? Why hate? Why fear? Why war?
Why the feelings of uneasiness if all is but a single form of energy entertaining itself?
Can the state of the world change?
Can the state of the world change?
If energy only seems to transform then why not?
It seems as if darkness has always reigned over
We live on a planet amongst the system in a dark space
A planet amongst other planets routing around the sun
In the same fashion as electrons do
Around the nucleus which form the cells, which form us
Ah yes, all is one, and my friends, it is beautiful
Let us unify our heart, now feel your power and I thank you
Peace and forever


Yeah, uh
Snap ya fingers, do ya step
Ayyy, where we at with it?
Where you at? Uh, uh
What era is this, man?

The era of the musical beautiful mistakes
Delivered hand to hand like we slangin' the mixtapes
You tryin' to describe us, you might as well get it straight
We the content creators, we greater than clickbait
The passion for the culture, the vultures they try to kill it
It's a war for your spirit, the lyrics is here to heal us
We looking for the fountain to keep us forever young
While I get my energy from the sun, all things are one
Rollin' the blunt on a copy of Native Sun
Gettin' hung just for speakin' the native tongue
My color is my penalty mentally on the run
Photosynthesizing my energy from the sun, huh
Releasing blockages I ain't stoppin' until they gone
Feeling weighted down like my pockets is full of stone
Until I realized I can change what's going on (let's go!)
To every single place I go I'm right at home
I'm right at home (let's go!)
Waiting for that day to come, huh
Looking for fountains to keep us forever young
Get my energy from the sun
Rollin' the blunt on a copy of Native Sun
Gettin' hung just for speakin' the native tongues
Every Sunday waking up catching gossip at its worst
Couldn't see the difference in the Baptist and the Catholic Church
Caught up in the rapture of the first chapter and second verse
If we all God's children, then what's the word of the reverend worth?
Taught early that faith is blind like justice when you facing time
If we all made in God's image then that means his face is mine
Wait, or it's that blasphemy it's logical it has to be
If I don't look like my father then the way I live is bastardly
Naturally that's confusion to a young'n trying to follow Christ
Taught that if you don't know Jesus then you lead a hollow life
Never question the fact that Jesus was a Jew and not a Christian
Or that Christianity was made law by politicians
And who was King James? And why did he think that it was so vital
To remove chapters and make his own version of the Bible
They say Hell is underground, Heaven is in the sky
They say that's where you go when you die, but how they know?
I've been to many churches, I've quoted many verses
I've dealt with my base self, I controlled my many urges
I used to study my lessons, that was a blessing not a curse
I found out that heaven and hell exist right here on earth, word
Studied with Rastafarians, found out from the dreads that hell
Is called Babylon and that's where the crazy boarheads dwell
They got us thinking that Muslims like to make bombs
But real muslims believe in paradise and resisting Shaitan
So it all sound the same to me
But when they say one's right and the other is wrong
It just sound like game to me
It's like God skipped past the church and came to me
No that ain't vain to me
It's just a particular way that I came to see
The difference between those that claim to be
Religious and those that say they spiritual
And recognize that life is full of miracles
You can see the flow is divine
I glow when I rhyme
Cause it coincide with a growing tide
Of those looking for God that know to go inside
Looking for absolution
Living in mass confusion
The gas inducing psychopath created a last solution
Based on his interpretation
Of what the words are saying
Looking for God but ended up doing the work of satan
Religion create division
Make the Muslim hate the Christian
Make the Christian hate the Jew
Make up rules of faith
That you condition to and gotta follow
God forbid you go to Hell
But if you ever been to any ghetto, then you know it well
Peace
Gravitas, light it up
Lighten it up, brighten it up, yea
You want the grown step your bars up
You brag about the scrilla them killas lighten your cars up
Welcome to the complete history of the one known as Talib Kweli

Such a blessing, I'm making the bread leven
Descendant of Terra Firma I'm from the era of legend
The blind to my eyesight, too scared of the world ending
My men of spiritual essence be walking right into heaven
Ascending without the stairs, expressing without the fears
We diamonds but our minds are corrupted just like De Beers
Unravelling minds, travelling through time like langoliers
Standing with the flow like the man in the gondolier
In the park of Washington Square, locks in my hair
Louder than the bull horns we was locking 'em there
Cops would prepare to lock us up
They was scared like tales from the dark side
Summer of the Central Park five
1989 was the number, the year that I started rhyming
From Brooklyn to Staten Island them Decepticons was wildin'
Music soothing but the imagery violent as bomb threats
Therapy for the prison industrial complex
Provided the context for the crime with the TEC-9
At Brooklyn Tech I spit it the best so they had to respect mine
I did it to death on my grind on a quest to get signed
Sorta like the tribe would always suggest we check the rhyme
An internal with Puff Daddy, in front of the buffed patio
Rolling with Hi Tek in the MPV through the streets of the 'Nati
Before graduating to Caddies was carrying crates
Shoutout to Flex all day doing records with John Forte
We was standing outside the tower devouring prey
Powerful display of bullet points that we shower and spray the block with
Back in them salad days these rappers was appetizers
I played it like I was David, I was tackling that Goliath
Attacking the open mics to the victory was decisive
This life it was so enticing, my surgery so precise
I would chop it like thin slices at parties we politic
At the country club, lighting up dutches with Pac and Big
At the crib of supernatural battling back and forth
Back before Jean was in the unsigned hype in the back of The Source
Rest in peace to Allah's sons, Shabba was liking to call you son
Cause you mine I call you son cause you shine
What's up Alyasha, this is OG Brooklyn shit
Not for impostors, pour out a shot of vodka for them
Big L, Big Poppa, Big Pun, 2Pac
The jungle is too savage, rap true master producing the new classic
This shit is too classic it's blow to  to spinal tap
I started with the Rawkus Recording we work the vinyl backwards
From DEF JUX to Loaded Lux
I'm the underground king like I'm rolling with Bun and 
The flow is nuts it's solid I got the golden touch
Plus my iron sheek and I got the game and the cobra clutch
This the highest caliber do the algebra
From Yasiin Bey to Jean Grey to Pharoahe Monch
Black Thought to Common
Almost 20 years after the release of Soundbombing
And it still sounds timeless
I'm out and on tour with the greatest, A Tribe Called Quest
And the De La's, opened for Jay Z and Nas, who else could say this?
In Vegas with Tech 9 getting faded before the gig
Only later to hit the RIO and hop on the stage with Prince
True story, I always knew the importance of great shows
Since 1992 I seen Ice Cube play Toads, way cold
Continue to pave the road for the Kendricks and J. Coles
Continue to stake gold
From making the way for Kanye to meetings with Mr. Harry Belafonte
All started on park benches with Dante
Predicting the future, so observant I'm clairvoyant
The frame can't contain it, I'm painting a rare portrait
Yeah! Come on! What it is
It's the P-l-a-n-e-t R-o-c-k
Kweli, BK, c'est la vie
You could tell I be hell-a-free like college radio
WQHT gonna play me though
This hot shit is to fly like the cockpit
Got spit like a french kiss chicks lock lips
Coming from the deep black like the Loch Ness
Now bring apocalypse like the heart of darkness
It's like the heart of the artist become a target
Pop music is the black market
Recently we witness bizarre shit
The war hit the same time as SARS hit
Terrorists send bombs at the concert
The show must go on yo regardless
I'm just some hip-hop kid to pop shit
And get on some rock shit and start a mosh pit

Yeah
We got the beat to make the planet roooccccckkk
(Come on, Come on)
Yeah, Come on
We got the beat to make the planet rooocccckkkk
(Come on, Come on)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We got the planet to rock, Kweli's standing on top
I'm like a panther when I answer to cops
And bust back before the man get a shot
And the blood on their veins run cold like the cannibal lox
And bring heat like the blood of the mammal that's hot
And keep fighting like the boy with the mechanical heart
And watch time count down on the hands of the clock
Till the hour when the pinnacle start
Wow, and go fast like the bullet that ran through the dark
The hollow tip ripped a man apart, blaow
Yo these soldiers die in petroleum wars
Think they fighting for the holliest cause
It don't matter if you Muslim, Hebrew, or you a Christian
Information is the newest religion, is a true way of living
Ain't no rule to a surpestition stop me with going through with my mission
Come on man


Come on get down, get down, get down, get down
Go ladies, go, go, go ladies, go, go
Come on all my ghetto people stand strong
We rocking on and on
One for me, now rocking with the best and is Kweli
You ain't no MC like me, you just a clone like KFC
Come on, B-Boys, B-Girls, we rocking the world


Don't belive niggas running the place
Man everything is dangerous nothing is safe, nigga
Think you a man with a gun in your waist
Let the cops disrespect you right in front of your face
Take it out on your girl, punch her in the face
You ain't a thug you a waste of space
Nigga get out the way, B-boys gonna rock till the break!
How much can a planet take
(Repeat until end)
We got the beat...
Oh yeah
That’s the universal language right there
The have nots, vs the have

Growing up, sure was tough
When the money, getting to slowing up
A promise is hard as trying to do to knowledge
When you don’t know enough
Poor enough to notice
But you pour it up, and you throw it up
They say that when they comin'
But we ain't runnin', nobody as cold as us
My life is like a play
But I don’t grace stages
Try to feed my family, but it’s hard on these slave wages
Lucifer behind me, crucify me like a god suh
They never want to pay us, but immigrants get the job done
Job one is self-preservation
I gotta stay healthy
The system always favors the riches, make sure they stay wealthy
How they gon' stop it, if education for profit
The prophets make revelations
The gangsters go in your pockets
I’m stocking up on these favors, cause vagrancy never fly
They value people for they paper
Like animals for they hides
And the battle cry, is that there’s value in our lives
Spirituality over money is where our power lies

Mon cœur je dois partir
Je sais c'est difficile
Plus tard tu comprendras
Mais ne t'en fais pas pour moi
J'allumerai chaque soir
Des étoiles dans le ciel
Papa sera bientôt là
Reste ici, attends-moi

The attitude they employ say it all
It’s just aristocratic
Fascist police’ll murder people who give em static
They’ll make a cheap version of smack
And sell that shit to addicts
Systematic or incidental that shit is just as tragic
I’m just emphatically and dramatically overwhelmed fam
No job, no money, no safety net, no health plan
No car, no home, no food on the table
No way to provide for my people
Though I’m willing and able to
To pry off government assistance
Cause a feeling’ll enable you
Where pride ain't practical when you lacking that capital
Holes in my clothes, this was never a fashion show
Too broke for the sour roll
But that don’t matter though
Talk is cheap, I had enough of the back and forth
I’m on the verge, snapping out
Trying to laugh it off
I love to work for myself
‘Cause is sucks when you have a boss
But I least I have a job, no one is promised to have it all
I’m in the rat race; pick up the phone when the cattle call
Spitting these tree songs, keep calm like Adderall

Mon cœur je dois partir
Je sais c'est difficile
Plus tard tu comprendras
Mais ne t'en fais pas pour moi
J'allumerai chaque soir
Des étoiles dans le ciel
Papa sera bientôt là
Reste ici, attends-moi
Hey Y'all
I feel good right? (mmm...hmmm...)
Yeah, ok, uhh..
Now what that make me talk about?
Love, love, love, love...(echoes)
Yeah, that's what the world need, ha
Yo, that's what your girl need
All right, we gon' put it down like this
I'll tell you about myself

My name is Kweli and I love to spit it homie
I rap about love and life, ladies get to know me
If you feelin' lonely, I can be your one and only
I put it out in the world, so people show me... love (echoes)
Yeah, I always get it back
This ain't no pimp game here, that's a different track
We talkin' this and that, we need to get with this
I keep it realer than most, this is our business

What we gotta do to make them see
We got a good thing going on
Wanna tell the world if they don't know
That what we have is real
Wanna shout it from the mountains baby
That I love you, but if they don't hear me
I know, you know, we know

Yo, hey baby look like you need a break tonight
Let me make it right, baby won't you stay the night
I got a lot of love as you know you're my favorite right?
Hey my lady, what we gon' make tonight (our love...)
That's the dream, but I never sleep
Across the crowded room, our eyes forever meet
But without doubt and gloom, cuz we can never be
That's why I got to go, cuz you're my impossible love
You're the horizon I can see but never ride off into
I write my lyrics to you, you the perfect instrumental
I sound better than the cat who rappin' to you now
That's between me and you, what happened to us now?
Got you hopin' for the glorious
Waitin' for that victorious feelin' wanted by all of us
Kneelin' and praying that the lord in us will help us love ourselves
So much that the confidence attract to someone else


Yo, Rockin' Los Angeles, House of Blues in Sunset
Performin' like an orgasm, my girl ain't even cum yet
Seen her by the side of the stage givin' me energy
Potentially, wife material connectin' mentally
I felt like heaven sent for me, you're meant for me
The doubters and the haters had to acknowledge eventually
You was a non-believer too if memory serves
And a heart that gives shit, tryin' to play your boy for the her
The harder that I run to you, the farther you become
It's like my heart was part of some movie that hadn't yet begun
This woman moves me and I'm a mountain of a man
You pull me in like the waves do the grain of sand (love, love, love...)
Yeah, I love the way you bring it to me
I wrote a song for you, I love to hear you to sing it for me
And let the melody carry me through the jealousy
And we can cruise like Tom and Penelope
 x4
What's real? Do you know?
What's real? Let me show ya

I'mma start this story, my influence so enormous
Got that shit you love to sing along with
Like every line is the chorus
I'm born in Brooklyn like Biggie
I'm born in Brooklyn like Jordan
I'm born in Brooklyn like Tyson
You don't live this, you just a tourist
We ride or die for them corners
Fuck your private life they spy on us
When they catch us man it's like practice
For the new tactics that they try on us
Them cops are lining them coffers
Why we get shot we lying in coffins
They want my demise cause when I arrive they stop for lines so often
Nigga just stop, you might as well forfeit
We like Shia LaBeouf so lawless
Still recognize real, still recognize real
Like the car I'm driving you foreign
My diamond cut so flawless
No not jewels I'm talking bout songs bitch
So if they after me like I'm Lauryn
I tell the feds that I'm moorish
We walking, all the girls is talking
Generally they butt fucking naked just like the Book of Mormon
We see the trees for them forest
My name ring them bells like a doorman
Y'all niggas game is so corny
That's why you grill them hoes just like Forman, boring
 x4

Paper chasing we on that grind
Reputation on the line
Crazy, borderline - pay me, on time
Crazy, borderline - pay me, on time
Crazy, borderline - pay me, on time
Explore and discover what most fear
I will never wait til the brush clear
Swear I will never get stuck here
America, fuck yea
Measure my career in dog years
My passport got them dog ears
I set sail, travelling the world like Jesus was doing in his lost years
I might give you the pill like Morpheus
I'm like the P.E. logo in the cross hairs
Standing out cause there's nothing but whores here
Pimps rock crocodile like false tears
Bring it on through your force field
I'll be giving you nothing but the raw deal
What I say on display is the purest skill
I'll be giving y'all niggas what's more real
What's more real, what's more real?
I got chicks fighting like floor sales
You gossiping bloggers all fail
Look at the yardstick measuring your tall tales
And you on all fours you small scale
All in between the legs like a dog's tail
You are what you eat, you don't want no beef
You completely vegan like all kale
 x6
Let me holler at you

Can I talk to you?(x5)

I want you, cuz you make my heart skip the beat that I drum to
I want to be the one you run to, when pain confronts you
You're everything, sometimes I get nervous when I'm in front you
You can hear it in my voice when I ask you if you comfortable
Look how love do
I'd practice the Art of War for you like Sun Tzu
Come through and arouse you every morning like the sun do
If you blackout and collapse I want to help you to come to
Notice I haven't yet got into what I want from you
I want you to come to when I come through and make you shine like the sun do
I want you to be the valley for my river to run through
You're everything, you send your soul through your lips to my heart
Sweet music will start I want you to be the muse for my art
When people try to rip us apart we got to work to stay together
Go through the seasons of love and never change with the weather
This is my wish list, what I want not what I need there's a difference
These days I'm learning that words got power so I'mma be specific
Word

Can I have a talk with you?
Can I make a dream come true?
Can I be in love with you?
Cuz I would if I could

Yeah sunflower
You must live in the infinite blackness that exists when I close my eyes
I see you when I fall asleep, I see you when I dream

Lil' darlin'
Set your soul on fire (lil' darlin')
Be your one desire (lil' darlin')
Lil' darlin'
Can I talk to you? (lil' darlin')
Lil' darlin', lil' darlin'
Can I talk? (lil' darlin')
Can I talk, can I talk, can I?
Lil' darlin' (lil' darlin')
Can I talk to you? (lil' darlin')
Let him talk to you
Set your soul on fire

('Fuck all you hoes!' Get a grip, motherfucker!)
Yeah, this album is dedicated
To all the teachers that told me I'd never amount to nothin'
To all the people that lived above the buildings that I was hustlin' in front of
Called the police on me when I was just tryin' to make some money to feed my daughter (it's all good)
And all the niggas in the struggle
You know what I'm sayin'? It's all good, baby baby

It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed in Bambu, sippin' on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number, same hood, it's all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

You know very well
Who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down
Reach for the stars
You had a goal
But not that many
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty

I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach and I'm far from cheap
I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
The Mo?t and Aliz�� keep me pissy, girls used to diss me
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rapping stuff
I was too used to packing gats and stuff
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the East Coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Living life without fear
Puttin' five karats in my baby girl ear
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

You know very well
Who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down
Reach for the stars
You had a goal
But not that many
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty

Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
When I was dead broke, man, I couldn't picture this
50-inch screen, money-green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is loungin'
Celebrating every day, no more public housin'
Thinkin' back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps an Ac' with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip Champagne when we thirsty
Uh, damn right I like the life I live
'Cause I went from negative to positive
And it's all�� (It's all good, nigga)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

You know very well
Who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
Reach for the stars
You had a goal
But not that many
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

Representin' B-Town in the house
Junior Mafia, mad flavor
Uh, uh, yeah, a'ight

You know very well
Who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down
Reach for the stars
You had a goal
But not that many
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty

Biggie Smalls, it's all good, nigga
Junior Mafia, it's all good, nigga
Bad Boy, it's all good, nigga
It's all good
That's right, '94
And on and on, and on and on
You know very well
It's all good
Who you are
Yeah��
Don't let 'em hold you down
Reach for the stars
Uh, uh, check it out (yeah), uh
Junior M.A.F.I.A., uh (hehe)
Uh (I like this) yeah, yeah
Nine-fo' (keep bangin')

To all the ladies in the place with style and grace
Allow me to lace these lyrical douches in your bushes
Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mamis?
The back of the club, sippin' Mo?t is where you'll find me
The back of the club, mackin' hoes, my crew's behind me
Mad question askin', blunt passin'
Music blastin', but I just can't quit
Because one of these honeys Biggie got to creep with
Sleep with, keep the ep a secret, why not?
Why blow up my spot cause we both got hot?
Now check it: I got more mack than Craig, and in the bed
Believe me, sweetie, I got enough to feed the needy
No need to be greedy, I got mad friends with Benzes
C-notes by the layers, true fuckin' players
Jump in the Rover and come over
Tell your friends jump in the GS3, I got the chronic by the tree

I love it when you call me big poppa
Throw your hands in the air if you's a true player
I love it when you call me big poppa
To the honies getting money
Playing niggas like dummies
I love it when you call me big poppa
If you got a gun up in your waist
Please don't shoot up the place!
��Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be having my baby, baby

Straight up, honey, really I'm askin'
Most of these niggas think they be mackin', but they be actin'
Who they attractin' with that line
"What's your name? What's your sign?"
Soon as he buy that wine, I just creep up from behind
And ask you what your interests are, who you be with
Things that make you smile, what numbers to dial
You gon' be here for a while?
I'm gon' go call my crew, you go call your crew
We can rendezvous at the bar around 2
Plans to leave, throw the keys to Lil Cease
Pull the truck up front, and roll up the next blunt
So we can steam on the way to the telly, go fill my belly
A T-bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch's grape
Conversate for a few, ��cause in a few we gon' do
What we came to do, ain't that right, boo? (true)
Forget the telly, we just go to the crib
And watch a movie in the jacuzzi, smoke L's while you do me

I love it when you call me big poppa
Throw your hands in the air if you's a true player
I love it when you call me big poppa
To the honies getting money
Playing niggas like dummies
I love it when you call me big poppa
If you got a gun up in your waist
Please don't shoot up the place!
��Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be having my baby, baby

(How you living, Biggie Smalls?) In mansions and Benzes
Givin' ends to my friends, and it feels stupendous
Tremendous cream: fuck a dollar and a dream
Still tote gats strapped with infrared beams
Choppin' Os, smokin' la in Optimos
Money, hoes and clothes: all a nigga knows
A foolish pleasure? Whatever
I had to find the buried treasure, so grams I had to measure
However, living better now, Coogi sweater now
Drop top BM's, I'm the man, girlfriend

Yeah, honey, check it��
Tell your friends to get with my friends
And we can be friends
Shit, we can do this every weekend, aight?
Is that aight with you?
Yeah�� keep bangin'

I love it when you call me big poppa
Throw your hands in the air if you's a true player
I love it when you call me big poppa
To the honies getting money
Playing niggas like dummies
I love it when you call me big poppa
If you got a gun up in your waist
Please don't shoot up the place!
��Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be having my baby, baby

Uh, check it out
Nine-fo' shit for that ass, uh
Puff Daddy, Biggie Smalls, Junior M.A.F.I.A
Represent��baby, baby, uh
Hello? Aw shit, nigga!
What the fuck time is it, man?
Oh goddamn, nigga!
Do you know what time it is?
Aw shit, what the fuck's goin' on? You a'ight?
Nigga, what the fuck is wrong with you?

When I die, fuck it, I wanna go to hell
'Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven with the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Timbs and black hoodies
God'll prob'ly have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin' my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies, loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
(You talkin' some crazy shit now, nigga)
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wish she got a fuckin' abortion
She don't even love me like she did when I was younger
(Get a hold of yourself, nigga!)
Suckin' on her chest just to stop my fuckin' hunger
I wonder: if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies
My baby mother's eight months, her little sister's two
Who's to blame for both of them? (Nah, nigga, not you)
I swear to God I want to just slit my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit
(Nigga, what the fuck?)
And squeeze until the bed's completely red
(It's too late for this shit, man)
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fuckin' buddha head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't�� I can't believe
(Yo, I'm on my way over there, man)
Suicide's on my fuckin' mind, I wanna leave
I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
But nah, you wouldn't understand
(Nigga, talk to me please, man!)
You see it's kinda like the crack did to Pookie in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back
(Yo, I'ma call you when I get in the car)
Should I die on the train track like Ramo in Beat Street
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me
(Ayo, where your girl at, man?)
My baby mama kiss me, but she glad I'm gone
(Yo, put your girl on the phone, nigga!)
She know me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I reach my peak, I can't speak
(Ayo, you listenin' to me, motherfucker?)
Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak (Ayo, c'mon, nigga)
I'm sick of niggas lyin', I'm sick of bitches hawkin'
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin' *BANG*
(Ayo Big! Ayo Big!)

{Heartbeat slowing}
Please hang up, and try your call again
Please hang up��is a recording
Hah, sicker than your average
Poppa twist cabbage off instinct
Niggas don't think shit stink
Pink gators, my Detroit players
Timbs for my hooligans in Brooklyn
Dead right, if the head right, Biggie there e'ry night
Poppa been smooth since days of Underoos
Never lose, never choose to, bruise crews who
Do somethin' to us, talk go through us
Girls walk to us, wanna do us, screw us
Who us? Yeah, Poppa and Puff
Close like Starsky and Hutch, stick the clutch
Dare I squeeze three at your cherry M-3
(Take that, take that, take that, ha ha!)
Bang every MC easily, busily
Recently niggas frontin', ain't sayin' nothin'
So I just speak my piece, keep my peace
Cubans with the Jesus piece, with my peeps
Packin', askin', "Who want it?"
You got it, nigga, flaunt it
That Brooklyn bullshit, we on it

Biggie, Biggie, Biggie, can't you see?
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your flashy ways
Guess that's why they broke, and you're so paid
Biggie, Biggie, Biggie, can't you see?
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your flashy ways
Guess that's why they broke, and you're so paid

I put hoes in NY onto DKNY
Miami, D.C. prefer Versace
All Philly hoes go with Moschino
Every cutie with a booty bought a Coogi
Now who's the real dookie?
Meaning, who's really the shit?
Them niggas ride dicks, Frank White push the six
Or the Lexus, LX, four and a half
Bulletproof glass, tints if I want some ass
Gonna blast, squeeze first, ask questions last
That's how most of these so-called gangsters pass
At last, a nigga rappin' about blunts and broads
Tits and bras, m��nage �� trois, sex in expensive cars
I'll still leave you on the pavement
Condo paid for, no car payment
At my arraignment, note for the plaintiff
"Your daughter's tied up in a Brooklyn basement"
Face it, not guilty, that's how I stay filthy
Richer than Richie, 'til you niggas come and get me

Biggie, Biggie, Biggie, can't you see?
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your flashy ways
Guess that's why they broke, and you're so paid
Biggie, Biggie, Biggie, can't you see?
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your flashy ways
Guess that's why they broke, and you're so paid

I can fill you with real millionaire shit (I can fill ya)
Escargot, my car go, one sixty, swiftly
Wreck it, buy a new one
Your crew run-run-run, your crew run-run
I know you sick of this, name brand nigga with
Flows, girls say he's sweet like licorice
So, get with this nigga, it's easy
Girlfriend, here's a pen, call me round ten
Come through, have sex on rugs that's Persian
Come up to your job, hit you while you workin'
For certain, Poppa freakin', not speakin'
Leave that ass leakin', like rapper demo
Tell them ho take they clothes off slowly
Hit 'em with the force like Obi
Dick black like Toby
Watch me roam like Romey
Lucky they don't owe me
Where the safe? Show me, homie (homie)

Biggie, Biggie, Biggie, can't you see?
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your flashy ways
Guess that's why they broke, and you're so paid
Biggie, Biggie, Biggie, can't you see?
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your flashy ways
Guess that's why they broke, and you're so paid
Biggie, Biggie, Biggie, can't you see?
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your flashy ways
Guess that's why they broke, and you're so paid

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

It's the ten crack commandments, what?
Nigga can't tell me nothing about this coke
Can't tell me nothing about this crack, this weed, my hustlin' niggas
Niggas on the corner I ain't forget you niggas, my triple beam niggas

I've been in this game for years, it made me a animal
There's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual
A step-by-step booklet for you to get
Your game on track, not your wig pushed back
Rule Nombre Uno: never let no one know
How much dough you hold cause you know
The cheddar breed jealousy 'specially
If that man fucked up, get yo' ass stuck up
Number 2: never let 'em know your next move
Don't you know Bad Boys move in silence and violence?
Take it from your highness
I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for they bricks and chips
Number 3: never trust nobody
Your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up
Hoodied and masked up, shit, for that fast buck
She be laying in the bushes to light that ass up
Number 4: I know you heard this before
"Never get high on your own supply"
Number 5: never sell no crack where you rest at
I don't care if they want a ounce, tell 'em "bounce!"
Number 6: that goddamn credit? Dead it
You think a crackhead paying you back, shit forget it!
7: this rule is so underrated
Keep your family and business completely separated
Money and blood don't mix like two dicks and no bitch
Find yourself in serious shit
Number 8: never keep no weight on you!
Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jums too
Number 9 shoulda been Number 1 to me:
If you ain't gettin' bagged stay the fuck from police
If niggas think you snitchin' they ain't trying to listen
They be sittin' in your kitchen, waiting to start hittin'
Number 10: a strong word called "consignment"
Strictly for live men, not for freshmen
If you ain't got the clientele, say "hell no!"
Cause they gon' want they money rain sleet hail snow
Follow these rules you'll have mad bread to break up
If not, 24 years on the wake up
Slug hit your temple, watch your frame shake up
Caretaker did your makeup, when you passed
Your girl fucked my man Jake up
Heard in three weeks she sniffed a whole half of cake up
Heard she suck a good dick, and can hook a steak up
Gotta go gotta go, more pies to bake up, word up
Crack King, Frank Wiz-zhite

Armed and dangerous, ain't too many can bang with us
Straight up weed, no angel dust
Label us "Notorious
Thug-ass niggas that love to bust," it's strange to us
Y'all niggas be scramblin', gamblin'
Up in restaurants with mandolins and violins
We just sittin' here tryna win, try not to sin
High off weed and lots of gin
So much smoke, need oxygen
Steadily countin' them Benjamins
Nigga, you should too if you knew what this game'll do to you
Been in this shit since '92
Look at all the bullshit I been through
So-called beef with you-know-who
Fucked a few female stars or two
Then I blew like, nigga, move like Mike
Shit, not to be fucked with
Motherfucker better duck quick
'Cause me and my dogs love to buck shit
Fuck the luck shit, strictly aim
No aspirations to quit the game
Spit your game, talk your shit
Grab your gat, call your clique
Squeeze your clip, hit the right one
Pass that weed, I got to light one
All them niggas, I got to fight one
All them hoes, I got to like one
Our situation is a tight one
What you gonna do: fight or run?
Seems to me that you'll take B
Bone and Big, nigga, die slowly
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
"Cash Rules Everything Around Me"
Shit, lyrically, niggas can't see me
Fuck it, buy the coke, cook the coke, cut it
Know the bitch 'fore you caught yourself lovin' it
Nigga with a Benz fuckin' it
Doesn't it seem odd to you?
Big come through with mobs and crews
Goodfellas down to the Mo' Thugs dudes
Who's the killer: me or you?

We forgive you, for you know not what you do

7 AM, woke in the morning
With Hen' and caffeine and green and nicotine
No dough, so pop a couple of doze
Lil' RIPsta, nigga Mista Clean, nigga Dean
Deep in my temple and not to get sentimentally steamed
With my instrumelody, and heated, especially for your team
And a .45 indeed will beam in between the scenes
Destroy your dreams; you willin' to die? We'll see
How many flee when I cause the scene?
We mean mug, Mo' Thugs, trained to be perfect disciples
When it's survival, tongue is a double-edged sword
Triple six rivals spittin' fire
This the real truth, bitch, breakin' out for lies
My Messiah's better be ready for Armageddon, shit's expired
It's wild, bless the child, the one that became a man
Put in positions off in the Clair
All that I had to do was stare
Test me now, contender; never no surrender, no pretend
Pick up my pen, in my hand, one of my trusted friend-friends
Hey, open it! Let's see if we're real, we all suited
Beg my pardon to Martin: baby, we ain't marchin', we shootin'
In daily recruitin', there's a thug born everyday in the ghetto
We start 'em off little, we give 'em a bible
And a pen and a pad to hit the label �C kick it, nigga!

Nigga roll with Bone up into the Thug spot
To the dome with a shot of bird
Never get tossed to the curb
Be feelin' that urge to splurge
But I'm broke as fuck, Sin, give me that Mossberg swerve!
Up into my bag, ��cause I gotta get my mask and shells
To put in this 12 gauge sawed-off
Get 'em hauled off, nigga, your loss
Take it all off, got a nigga caught off
But the Bone, not Leatherface
Too many are thinkin' they thugs
And little Mo Hart want to pull it and bust it
And bitch, if you steppin', we buckin' them guts �C that's fucked up
Now let me get done with the grime
Gotta go purchase a dime
Put in a state to get done with the crime
Smokin' the reefer to ease my mind
Swig some wine, step on the block with the rocks
But really we be servin' them dummies, see?
Gotta buck him on down
If he come back talkin', like, "Give me back me money!"
Thuggin' with me killers
Need us a liter of liquor, but niggas ain't got shit
With a sawed-off pump, chrome .38 pistol
Now, who ready to get bent?
Nigga like me fiendin' for them green leaves
But I ain't had no dough
Gotta make some money
So I'm makin' my dummy rocks if I go broke

It's Bone and Biggie, Biggie
(We gon' rock the party, rock the party, party)
It's Bone and Biggie, Biggie
Just Bone and Biggie, Biggie
It's Bone and Biggie, Biggie

Get high, get high, get high, c'mon, c'mon
Let's ride, let's ride, let's ride, let's ride
Get high, get high, get high, c'mon, c'mon

Yeah, Little Lay, hey, comin' in the form of scripture
Finna get ya and hit ya with magic
Droppin' down lead, but I call it my gadgets
With an automatic-status, we spray
Time to load the Glocks, but I'm thinkin' not
There's another evil force tellin' me to do what I gotta do
So I up my pipe, a nigga dyin' tonight
And I'm always runnin' from the boys in blue
Biggie, blue��s on my ass
Pull out the cellular phone to call Bone: "What's happenin'?"
Grab artillery, a nigga start packin'
��Cause a motherfucker tried to get me in a jackin'
And I did him, hit him right between the eyes
The spot was wise; wanna test a nigga size, it'll cost him
Nigga fuck around with the wrong shit
Y'all get mo' murdered all day, all day
We done paved the way and I'm on the run
I'ma call my boys and bring all the guns
Y'all niggas wanna have a little fun with number one, one, one?
Bloody red, red, rum, rum, rum, rum, rum, rum
Bloody red, red, rum, rum, rum, rum, rum, rum
Bloody red, red, rum��

Hard to creep them Brooklyn streets

I can hear sweat trickling down your cheek
Your heartbeat sound like Sasquatch feet
Thundering, shaking the concrete
Then the shit stop when I foil the plot
Neighbors call the cops, said they heard mad shots
Saw me in the drop, three and a quarter
Slaughter, electrical tape around your daughter
Old school, new school need to learn though
I burn, baby, burn like "Disco Inferno"
Burn slow like blunts with yayo
Peel more skins than Idaho Potato
Niggas know: the lyrical molesting is taking place
Fucking with B.I.G. it ain't safe
I make your skin chafe, rashes on them asses
Bumps and bruises, blunts and Land Cruisers
Big Poppa smash fools, bash fools
Niggas mad because I know that cash rules
Everything around me two Glock 9s
Any motherfucker whispering about mines
And I'm Crooklyn's finest

I seen the light excite all the freaks
Stack mad chips, spread love with my peeps
Niggas wanna creep, gotta watch my back
Think the Cognac and indo sack make me slack?
I switches all that, cocksucker G's up
One false move, get Swiss cheesed up
Clip to TEC, respect I demand it
Slip and break the 11th Commandment
Thou shalt not fuck with nor see Poppa
Feel a thousand deaths when I drop ya
I feel for you, like Chaka Khan I'm the don
Pussy when I want, Rolex on the arm
You'll die slow but calm
Recognize my face, so there won't be no mistake
So you know where to tell Jake, lame nigga
Brave nigga, turned front page nigga
Puff Daddy flips daily
I smoke the blunts he sips on the Baileys
On the rocks, tote Glocks at christenings
Hammer cock, in the fire position and...

Come here, come here, (It ain't gotta be like that, Big)
Open your fucking mouth, open your��didn't I tell you?
Don't fuck with me? (Come on, man)
Huh? Didn't I tell you not to fuck with me? (Come on, man)

Now, who's hot, who not?
Tell me who rock, who sell out in the stores?
You tell me who flopped, who copped the blue drop?
Whose jewels got rocks?
Who's mostly Dolce down to the tube sock?
The same old pimp, Mase
You know ain't nothing change but my limp
Can't stop till I see my name on a blimp
Guarantee a million sales, call it level up
You don't believe in Harlem World, nigga, double up
We don't play around, it's a bet, lay it down
Niggas didn't know me '91, bet they know me now
I'm the young Harlem nigga with the Goldie sound
Can't no Ph.D. niggas hold me down
Cudda schooled me to the game, now I know my duty
Stay humble, stay low, blow like Hootie
True pimp niggas spend no dough on the booty
And then you yell, "There go Mase!", there go your cutie

I don't know what they want from me
It's like the more money we come across
The more problems we see

I'm the D to the A to the D-D-Y
Know you'd rather see me die than to see me fly
I call all the shots, rip all the spots
Rock all the rocks, cop all the drops
I know you thinking now, "When all the ballin' stops?"
Nigga never home, gotta call me on the yacht
Ten years from now we'll still be on top
Yo, I thought I told you that we won't stop
Now what you gon' do with a crew
That got money much longer than yours
And a team much stronger than yours?
Violate me, this'll be your day, we don't play
Mess around, be D.O.A. be on your way
��Cause it ain't enough time here
Ain't enough lime here for you to shine here
Deal with many women but treat dimes fair
And I'm bigger than the city lights down in Times Square

I don't know what they want from me
It's like the more money we come across
The more problems we see

B-I-G P-O-P-P-A
No info for the DEA
Federal agents mad ��cause I'm flagrant
Tap my cell and the phone in the basement
My team supreme, stay clean
Triple beam lyrical dream, I be that
Cat you see at all events bent
Gats in holsters, girls on shoulders
Playboy, I told ya, mere mics to me
Bruise too much, I lose too much
Step on stage, the girls boo too much
I guess it's ��cause you run with lame dudes too much
Me lose my touch? Never that!
If I did, ain't no problem to get the gat
Where the true players at? Throw your Rolies in the sky
Wave 'em side to side and keep your hands high
While I give your girl the eye, player please
Lyrically, niggas see B.I.G be flossin��
Jig on the cover of Fortune, 5 double O
Here's my phone number, your man ain't got to know
I got the dough, got the flow down pizat
Platinum plus like thizat
Dangerous on trizacks, leave your ass flizat

I don't know what they want from me
It's like the more money we come across
The more problems we see
Yeah, mothafuckas better know
I'm a bad bad bad
Lock your windows, close your doors
Biggie Smalls

My man Inf left a Tec and a 9 at my crib
Turned his self in, he had to do a bid
A 1-to-3, he be home the end of '93
I'm ready to get this paper, G: you with me?

Motherfucking right, my pockets looking kinda tight
And I'm stressed
Yo, Biggie let me get the vest

No need for that, just grab the fucking gat
The first pocket that's fat, the Tec is to his back
Word is bond, I'mma smoke him, yo, don't fake no moves (what?)
Treat it like boxing, stick and move, stick and move

Nigga, you ain't got to explain shit
I've been robbing motherfuckas since the slave ships
With the same clip and the same .45
Two point blank, a motherfucker sure to die
That's my word, nigga even try to bogart
Have his mother singing, "It's so hard."

Yes, love��love your fucking attitude
Because the nigga play pussy, that's the nigga that's getting screwed
And bruised up from the pistol whipping
Welts on the neck from the necklace stripping
Then I'm dipping up the block and I'm robbing bitches too
Up the herringbones and bamboos
I wouldn't give a fuck if you're pregnant
Give me the baby rings and the #1 Mom pendant

I'm slamming niggas like Shaquille, shit is real
When it's time to eat a meal, I rob and steal
Cause mom dukes ain't giving me shit
So for the bread and butter I leave niggas in the gutter
Huh, word to mother, I'm dangerous
Crazier than a bag of fucking angel dust
When I bust my Gat, mothafuckas take dirt naps
I'm all that, and a dime sack, where the paper at?

When he's sticking you and taking all of your money

Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
(What's mines is mines and what's yours is mine)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
(What's mines is mines and what's yours is mine)

Big up, big up, it's a stick up, stick up
And I'm shooting niggas quick if ya hiccup
Don't let me fill my clip up in ya back and headpiece
The opposite of peace, sending Mom duke a wreath
You're talking to the robbery expert
Step into your wake with your blood on my shirt
Don't be a jerk and get smoked over being resistant
Cause when I lick shots, them shits is persistent

Goodness gracious, the papers!
Where the cash at? Where the stash at?
Nigga pass that
Before you get your grave dug from the main thug .357 slug
And my nigga Biggie got a itchy one grip

One in the chamber, thirty-two in the clip
Motherfuckas better strip, (yeah nigga, peel)
Before you find out how blue steel feel

From the Beretta, putting all the holes in ya sweater
The money-getter, motherfuckas don't know better
Rolex watches and colorful Swatches
I'm digging in pockets, motherfuckas can't stop it

Man niggas come through I'm taking high school rings too
Bitches get strangled for their earrings and bangles
And when I rock her and drop her, I'm taking her doorknockers
And if she's resistant: blakka, blakka, blakka

So go get your man bitch, he can get robbed too

Tell him Biggie took it, what the fuck he gonna do?
Man I hope apologetic or I'm a have to set it
And if I set it, the cocksucker won't forget it

Hey bitch, hey bitch, gimme your money bitch (when he's sticking you and taking all your money)

Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
(What's mines is mines and what's yours is mine)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
(What's mines is mines and what's yours is mine)

Man listen, all this walking is hurting my feet
Ooh money looks sweet

Where?

In the Isuzu jeep

Man, I throw him in the fiend you grab the fucking cream
And if he start to scream, bom bom, have a nice dream
Hold up, he got a fucking bitch in the car
Fur coats and diamonds, she think she a superstar

Ooh Biggie let me jack her, I'll kick her in the back
Hit her with the Gat

Yo chill shorty, let me do that
Just get the fucking car keys and cruise up the block
The bitch act shocked getting shot on the spot

Oh shit the cops

Be cool, fool
They ain't gonna roll up, all they want is fucking doughnuts

So why the fuck he keep looking?

I guess to get his life tooken
I just came home, ain't trying to see central booking
Oh shit, now he looking in my face
You better haul ass cause I ain't with no fucking chase
So lace up your boots, cause I'm about to shoot
A true motherfucka going out for the loot

Take that motherfuckers
All you hoes calling here for my daddy, get off his dick
Like that mommy?
*beep*
Hi Daddy, how you doing, this is Tyiest
I was thinking about you last night
Mm you actin' like you can't call me no more cause you busy n all that, but you trying to tell me it wasn't good?
*beep*
That shit is real fucked up what you did!
I hooked you up with my girl and shit you fucked her every time you see her, you don't even say shit to her, you know what I'm saying!
And all that bitch do is call me all day talking about you, "why the fuck Big don't want me?"
*beep*
Yo Big this is Quita, Kenya told me she saw you and Shanie at the mall and I know you ain't fucking her
You fucked with me last night, that's my best friend and we don't get down like that!
*beep*
Yeah motherfucker this is Stephanie
I was waiting outside for your ass for like a fucking hour
I don't know what's going on, motherfuckers trying to rob me, you be disappearing and shit, and I'm waiting in the cold
What the fuck is going on?
When you get in give me a fucking call alright?
*beep*

When it comes to sex, I��m similar to the Thrilla in Manila
Honeys call me "Bigga the Condom Filler"
Whether it��s stiff tongue or stiff dick
Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit, now check this shit
I got the pack of Rough Riders in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the epilogue by James Todd Smith
I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with a dick, make your kidney shift
Here we go, here we go, but I��m not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I wear thirteens, know what I mean?
I��ll fuck around and hit you with the Hennessy dick
Mess around and go blind, don��t get to see shit
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder
It doesn��t matter: skinny or fat or light-skinned or black
Baby, I drop these Boricua mamis screaming ?ay papi!
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
I only smoke blunts if they rolled proper
Look, I gotcha caught up with the drunk flow
Fuck tae kwon do, I tote a .44
For niggas getting mad cause they bitch chose me
A big black motherfucker with G
You see, all I do is separate the game from the truth
Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Getting physical like Olivia Newt
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia
So give me a ho, a bankroll and a bag of weed:
I��m guaranteed to fuck her ��til her nose bleed
Even if your new man��s a certified mack
You��ll get that H-Town in ya: you want that old thing back

Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
I got that good dick, girl, you didn��t know?
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
I got that good dick, girl, you didn��t know?
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
I got that good dick, girl, you didn��t know?
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance

Is my mind playing tricks, like Scarface and Bushwick
Willie D, having nightmares of girls killing me
She mad because what we had didn��t last
I��m glad because her cousin let me hit the ass
Fuck the past: let��s dwell on the 500SL, the E&J and ginger ale
The way my pockets swell to the rims with benjamins
Another honey��s in the crib? Please, send her in
I fuck non-stop, lick my lips a lot
Used to lick the clits a lot, but licking clits had to stop
��Cause y��all don��t know how to act when the tongue go down below
Peep the funk flow
Really, though, I got the cleanest, meanest penis
You never seen this stroke of genius
So take off your Tim boots and your body suit
I mean the spandex -- and hit my man next
Sex get rougher when it come to the nut buster
Pussy crusher, black nasty motherfucker
I don��t chase 'em, I replace 'em
And if I��m caressing 'em I��m undressing 'em
Fuck what you heard, who��s the best in New York
Fulfilling fantasies without that nigga Mr. Roarke or Tattoo
I got you wrapped around my dick and when I nut I got to split
Backshots is my position, I got you wishing for an intermission
Fuck the kissin'
Lick you down to your belly button, I ain��t frontin��
They don��t call me big for nuttin�� all of a sudden

Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
Who the fuck is this? Paging me at 5:46
In the morning, crack of dawn and
Now I'm yawning, wipe the cold out my eye
See who's this paging me and why?
It's my nigga, Pop, from the barbershop
Told me he was in the gambling spot and heard the intricate plot
Of niggas wanna stick me like flypaper, neighbor
Slow down love, please chill, drop the caper

Remember them niggas from the hill up in Brownsville
That you rolled dice with, smoked blunts and got nice with?

Yeah my nigga Fame up in Prospect
Nah them my niggas nah love wouldn't disrespect

I didn't say them, they schooled me to some niggas
That you knew from back when, when you was clocking minor figures
Now they heard you're blowing up like nitro
And they wanna stick the knife through your windpipe slow
So, thank Fame for warning me cause now I'm warning you
I got the Mac, nigga tell me what you gonna do

Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper

They heard about the Rolexes and the Lexus
With the Texas license plates out of state
They heard about the pounds you got down in Georgetown
And they heard you got half of Virginia locked down
They even heard about the crib you bought your moms out in Florida
The Fifth Corridor

Call the coroner!
There's gonna be a lot of slow singing and flower bringing
If my burglar alarm starts ringing
What ya think all the guns is for?
All-purpose war, got the Rottweilers by the door
And I feed em gunpowder, so they can devour
The criminals trying to drop my decimals
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my cream
And it ain't a dream, things ain't always what it seem
It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, see your picture
Now they wanna grab they guns and come and get ya
Bet ya Biggie won't slip
I got the Calico with the black talons loaded in the clip
So I can rip through the ligaments
Put the fuckers in a bad predicament, where all the foul niggas went
Touch my cheddar, feel my Beretta
Buck! What I'mma hit you with you motherfuckers better duck
I bring pain, bloodstains on what remains
Of his jacket - he had a gun he shoulda packed it
Cocked it, extra clips in my pocket
So I can reload and explode on you rasshole
I fuck around and get hardcore
C-4 to your door, no beef no more nigga
Feel the rough, scandalous
The more weed smoke I puff, the more dangerous
I don't give a fuck about you or your weak crew
What you gonna do when Big Poppa comes for you?
I'm not running, nigga I bust my gun and
Hold on, I hear somebody coming
Baby, look at me, Mama love you
And I know you ain't no little boy no more
But you'll always be my baby
It seems like only yesterday I was holding you in my arms
Now look at you now big, but I worry about you
I worry about you all the time, hangin' out on the corner
All times at night with the cruel people
Baby, that ain't nothin' but trouble
I always taught you that you could have whatever you dream
Well, I want you to hold on to that dream, baby
Hold on to it real tight, ��cause the sky's the limit

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
How's everybody doing tonight?
I'd like to welcome to the stage
The lyrically acclaimed
I like this young man, because when he came out
He came out with the phrase
He went from ashy to classy �C I like that
So everybody in the house
Give a warm round of applause for the Notorious B.I.G
The Notorious B.I.G
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for him y'all!

A nigga never been as broke as me, I like that
When I was young I had two pair of Lees, (besides that)
The pin stripes and the gray, the one I wore on Mondays and Wednesdays
While niggas flirt I'm sewing tigers on my shirts, and alligators
You want to see the inside, I see you later
Here comes the drama, oh
That's that nigga with the fake, blaow
Why you punch me in my face? Stay in your place
Play your position, here come my intuition
Go in this nigga pocket, rob him while his friends watchin'
And hoes clockin', here comes respect
His crew's your crew or they might be next
Look at they man eye, big man, they never try
So we rolled with them, stole with them
I mean loyalty, niggas bought me milks at lunch
The milks was chocolate, the cookies, butter crunch
88 Oshkosh and blue and white dunks; pass the blunts!

Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressing on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressing on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Have what you want, be what you want

I was a shame, my crew was lame
I had enough heart for most of them
Long as I got stuff from most of them
It's on, even when I was wrong I got my point across
They depicted me the boss, of course
My orange box-cutter make the world go round
Plus I'm fucking bitches, ain't my homegirls now
Start stacking, dabbled in crack, gun packing
Nickname Medina make the seniors tote my ni?as
From gym class to English pass off a global
The only nigga with a mobile, can't you see like Total
Getting larger in waists and tastes
Ain't no telling where this felon is headin', just in case
Keep a shell at the tip of your melon, clear the space
Your brain was a terrible thing to waste
'88 on gates, snatch initial name plates
Smokin' spliffs with niggas, real-life beginner killers
Praying God forgive us for being sinners, help us out

Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressing on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressing on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Have what you want, be what you want

After realizin', to master enterprisin'
I ain't have to be in school by ten, I then
Began to encounter with my counterparts
On how to burn the block apart, break it down into sections
Drugs by the selections
Some use pipes, others use injections
Syringe sold separately, Frank the Deputy
Quick to grab my Smith & Wesson like my dick was missin'
To protect my position, my corner, my lair
While we out here, say the Hustlers Prayer
If the game shakes me or breaks me
I hope it makes me a better man, take a better stand
Put money in my mom's hand
Get my daughter this college grant
So she don't need no man
Stay far from timid, only make moves when your heart's in it
And live the phrase "Sky's the limit"
Motherfuckers
See you chumps on top

Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressing on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressing on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Have what you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressing on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressing on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on

This goes out to you
This goes out to you, and you, and you, and you
This goes out to you
This goes out to you
This goes out to you, and you, and you

Your reign on the top was short like leprechauns
As I crush so-called willies, thugs, and rapper-dons
Get in that ass, quick fast, like Ramadan
It's that rap phenomenon Don Dada, fuck Poppa
You got to call me Francis M.H. White
Intake light tokes, tote iron
Was told in shootouts, stay low and keep firin'
Keep extra clips for extra shit
Who's next to flip on that cat with that grip on rap
The most shady, (Tell Em!) Frankie baby
Ain't no telling where I may be
May see me in D.C. at Howard Homecoming
With my man Capone, gumming, fucking something
You should know my steelo
Went from ten G's for blow to thirty G's a show
To orgies with hoes I never seen before
So, Jesus, get off the Notorious
Penis before I squeeze and bust
If the beef between us, we can settle it
With the chrome and metal shit
I make it hot like a kettle get
You're delicate, you better get - who sent ya?
You still pedal shit, I got more rides than "Great Adventure"
Biggie ("How are you gonna do it?")

Kick in the door, waving the four-four
All you heard was Poppa don't hit me no more
Kick in the door, waving the four-four
All you heard was Poppa don't hit me no more
Kick in the door, waving the four-four
All you heard was Poppa don't hit me no more
Kick in the door, waving the four-four
All you heard was Poppa don't hit me no more

On ya mark, get set, when I spark, ya wet
Look how dark it get when you're marked for death
Should I start your breath or should I let you die
In fear you start to cry, ask why
Lyrically I'm worshiped, don't front, the word sick
You cursed it, but rehearsed it
I drop unexpectedly like bird shit
You herbs get stuck quickly for royalties and show money
Don't forget the publishing, I punish em, I'm done with them
Son, I'm surprised you run with them
I think they got cum in them cause they nothing but dicks
Trying to blow up like nitro and dynamite sticks
Mad I smoke hydro, rock diamonds that's sick
Got paid off my flow, rhyme with my own clique
Take trips to Cairo, laying with your bitch
I know you praying you was rich, fucking prick
When I see ya I'mma

Kick in the door, waving the four-four
All you heard was Poppa don't hit me no more
Kick in the door, waving the four-four
All you heard was Poppa don't hit me no more
Kick in the door, waving the four-four
All you heard was Poppa don't hit me no more
Kick in the door, waving the four-four
All you heard was Poppa don't hit me no more

This goes out for those that choose to use
Disrespectful views on the King of N-Y
Fuck that, why try, throw bleach in your eye
Now ya brailling it, snatch that light shit, I'm scaling it
Conscious of ya nonsense, in eighty-eight
Sold more powder than Johnson and Johnson
Tote steel like Bronson, "Vigilante"
You wanna get on son, you need to ask me
Ain't no other kings in this rap thing
They siblings, nothing but my children
One shot they disappearin'
It's ill when MC's used to be on cruddy shit
Took home Ready to Die, listened, studied shit
Now they on some money shit, successful out the blue
They light weight, fragile, my nine milli
Make the whites shake, that's why my money never funny
And you still recouping, stupid stupid stupid stupid..
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle

I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like you's the user
Selling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way, mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray, so you can reminisce
And wish, you wasn't living so devilish, shit
I remember I was just like you
Smoking blunts with my crew, flippin' over 62's
Cause G-E-D wasn't B-I-G
I got P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out nicks went for 20 down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock 19 for casket and flower moves
For chumps tryin' to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment, he wasn't tryin' to hear it
Smoking mad Newports cause I'm due in court
For an assault that I caught in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand, cause man

I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle

I had the master plan, I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland
With my man Two-TEC's to take over this projects
They call him Two-TEC's, he tote two TEC's
And when he start to bust, he like to ask, "Who's next?"
I got my honey on the Amtrak with the crack
In the crack of her ass, two pounds of hash in the stash
I wait for hon to make some quick cash
I told her she could be lieutenant, bitch got gassed
At last, I'm literally lounging, black
Sitting back, counting double digit thousand stacks
Had to re-up, see what's up with my peeps
Toyota Deal-a-Thon had it cheap on the Jeeps
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead, with six to the head
Then I got the phone call, it couldn't hit me harder
We got infiltrated, like Nino at the Carter
Heard Tec got murdered in a town I never heard of
By some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners
And my bitch, swear to God she won't snitch
I told her when she hit the bricks, I'll make the hooker rich
Conspiracy, she'll be home in three
Until then I looks out for the whole family
A true G, that's me, blowing like a bubble
In the everyday struggle

I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle

I'm seeing body after body and our mayor Giuliani
Ain't tryin' to see no black man turn to John Gotti
My daughter use a potty so she's older now
Educated street knowledge, I'mma mould her now
Trick a little dough buying young girls fringes
Dealing with the dope fiend binges, seeing syringes
In the veins, hard to explain how I maintain
The crack smoke make my brain feel so strange
Breaking days on the set, no sweat
Drunk off Moet, can't bag yet because it's still wet
But when that dry, bagging five at a time
I can clock about nine on the check cashing line
I had the first and the third, rehearse, that's my word
Thick in the game, D's knew my first name
Should I quit? Shit no, even though they had me scared
Yo, they got a eight, I got a TEC with air holes

And that's just how the shit go in the struggle, mothafucka
Hah, come on, what you say?

I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle

Junior M.A.F.I.A. right
Yeah, rock on, woo!
Biggie Smalls, right
Junior M.A.F.I.A
The weak or the strong
Who got it going on?
You're dead wrong

Relax and take notes
While I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke��gun smoke, gun smoke
Biggie Smalls for mayor, the rap slayer, the hooker layer
Motherfucker, say your prayers!
"Hail Mary, full of grace��" smack the bitch in the face
Take her Gucci bag and the North Face off her back
Jab her if she act funny with the money
Oh, you got me mistaken, honey
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper
The Visa, capeesha? I'm out like The Vapors
Who's the one you call Mr. Macho?
The head honcho, swift fist, like Camacho
I got so much style I should be down with the Stylistics
"Make up to break up" Niggas need to wake up
Smell the Indonesia, beat you to a seizure
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins to amnesia
She don't remember shit, just the two hits
Her hittin' the floor and me hittin' the clit'
Sucking on the tits, had the hooker beggin' for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly, love, my dick got rocked quick
I guess I was a combination of House of Pain and Bobby Brown
I was humpin' around and jumpin' around
Jacked her, then I asked her, "Who's the man?"
She said, "B-I-G," then I bust in her E-Y-E

The weak or the strong
Who got it going on?
You're dead wrong

When I get dusted, I like to spread the blood like mustard
Trust it, my hardcore rain leaves you rusted
Move over Lucifer, I'm more ruthless, huh
Leave you toothless, you'll kibbitz, I'll flip it
Tears don't affect me, I hit 'em with the TEC
G's disrespect me, my potency is deadly
I'm shootin' babies; no ifs, ands, or maybes
Hit Mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis, after she sucked my dick
I stabbed her brother with the ice pick
Because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
But Smalls don't get down like that
Found your father hidin' in a room, fucked him with a broom
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
Who you think you're dealin' with?
Anybody step into my path is fuckin' feelin' it
Hardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy
Stab you 'til you're gushy, so please don't push me
I'm using rubbers so they won't trace the semen
The black demon, got the little hookers screamin'
Because you know I love it young, fresh and green
With no hair in between, know what I mean?

The weak or the strong
Who got it going on?
You're dead wrong
Ladies and gentlemens...

There's several different levels to Devil worshippin'
Horse's heads, human sacrifices, cannibalism
Candles and exorcism, animals, havin' sex with 'em
Camels, mammals and rabbits
But I don't get into that, I kicked the habit
I just beat you to death with weapons that eat through the flesh
And I never eat you unless the fuckin' meat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket
I'm lyin', I got a 9 in my pocket and, baby, I'm just dyin' to cock him
He's ready for war, I'm ready for war
I got machetes and swords for any faggot that said he was raw
My Uzi's heavy as yours, yeah you met me before
I just didn't have as large an arsenal of weapons before
Marshall will step in the door, I'll lay your head on the floor
With your body spread on the bedspread, red on the wall
Red on the ceiling, red on the floor
Get a new whore, met on the second, wed on the third
Then she's dead on the fourth; I'm dead wrong

The weak or the strong
Who got it going on?
You're dead wrong
First things first: I, Poppa, freaks all the honeys
Dummies, Playboy bunnies, those wanting money
Those the ones I like ��cause they don't get nathan
But penetration
Unless it smells like sanitation
Gar-bage, I turn like doorknobs
Heart throb never, Black and ugly as ever
However, I stay Coogi down to the socks
Rings and watch filled with rocks
And my jam knock in your Mitsubishi
Girls pee-pee when they see me
Navajos creep me in they teepee
As I lay down laws like Island Carpet
Stop it - if you think they gonna make a profit
Don't see my ones, gon' see my guns��get it?
Now tell your friends Poppa hit it, then split it
In two as I flow with the Junior M.A.F.I.A
I don't know what the hell is stopping ya
I'm clocking ya, Versace shades watching ya
Once ya grin, I'm in��game begins
First I talk about how I dress in this
Diamond necklaces, stretch Lexuses
The sex is just immaculate from the back, I get
Deeper and deeper, help you reach the
Climax that your man can't make
Call him, tell him you'll be home real late
And sing the break

Baby, here I am
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
All, I need is one more chance! One more chance
I can help you find, yourself
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
Cause you, don't need nobody else!
One more chance

She's sick of that song on how it's so long
Thought he worked his until I handled my biz
There I is, Major Payne like Damon Wayans
Low Down Dirty, even, like his brother Keenan
Schemin', don't leave your girl around me!
True player for real, ask Puff Daddy
You ringing bells with bags from Chanel
Baby Benz, traded in your Hyundai Excel
Fully equipped, CD changer with the cell
She beeped me meet me at twelve
Where you at? Flipping jobs, paying car notes?
While I'm swimming in your women like the breast stroke
Right stroke, left stroke was the best stroke
Death stroke, tongue all down her throat
Nothing left to do but send her home to you
I'm through can you sing the song for me boo


So what's it gonna be? Him or me?
We can cruise the world with pearls, gator boots for girls
The envy of all women, crushed linen
Cartier wrist-wear with diamonds in em
The finest women I love with a passion
Ya man's a wimp, I give that ass a good thrashin'
High fashion - flying into all states
Sexing me while your man masturbates
Isn't this great? Your flight leaves at eight
Her flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds
Lyrically, I'm supposed to represent
I'm not only a client, I'm the player President
Yo let��let��let me ask you a question yo
Yo, would you kill for me?
Hmmm... yeah
What took you so long to answer motherfucker?
I don't know
The fuck wrong with you bitch?

When I met you I admit my first thoughts was to trick
You look so good huh, I suck on your daddy's dick
I never felt that way in my life
It didn't take long before I made you my wife
Got no rings and shit, just my main squeeze
Comin' to the crib, even had a set a keys
During the days you helped me bag up my nickels
In the process, I admit, I tricked a little
But you was my bitch, the one who'd never snitch
Love me when I'm broke or when I'm filthy fuckin' rich
And I admit, when the time is right, the wine is right
I treat you right, you talk slick, I beat you right

Just me and my bitch, me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch, uh, just me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch
Yeah, just me and my bitch (just me and my bitch)
Just me and my bitch, me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch

But you know you love that ass, don't you?
Yeah, no question
No question
Yo, let me ask you another question
What?
You been fuckin' 'round on me?
Why would I do that?
Yo, don't lie to me motherfucker

Moonlight strolls with the hoes, oh no, that's not my steelo
I wanna bitch that like to play ceelo, and craps
Packin gats, in a Coach bag steamin dime bags
A real bitch is all I want, all I ever had
With a bop just as strong as me
Totin guns just as long as me, the bitch belongs with me
Any plans with another bitch, my bitch'll spoil it
One day, she used my toothbrush to clean the toilet (that's nasty)
Throwin my clothes out the windows, so when the wind blows
I see my Polos and Timbos
Hide my car keys so I can't leave
A real slick bitch, keep a trick up her sleeve
And if I deceive, she won't take it lightly
She'll invite me, politely, to fight, G
And then we lie together, cry together
I swear to God I hope we fuckin' die together

Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch, yeah

Let me tell you nigga, if I ever
Ever catch your ass fuckin' around
I'ma cut your mother-fuckin' dick off
Hah, heheh stop playin, hah
I ain't playin, ain't no jokes, ain't no jokes
Ain't no jokes
Yo, don- don't play with my dick

She helped me plan out my robberies on my enemies
Didn't hesitate to squeeze, to get my life out of danger
One day, she put 911 on the pager
Had to call back, whether it's minor or major
No response, the phone just rung
Grab my vest, grab my gun, to find out the problem
When I pulled up, police was on the scene
Had to make the U-turn, make sure my shit was clean
Drove down the block, stashed the burner in the bushes
Stepped to police with the shoves and the pushes
It didn't take long before the tears start
I saw my bitch dead with the gunshot to the heart
And I know it was meant for me
I guess the niggas felt they had to kill the closest one to me
And when I find 'em your life is to an end
They killed my best friend... me and my bitch

Just me and my bitch, me and my bitch
Just me and my, just me and my bitch, uh
Just me and my bitch, me and my bitch
Just me and my, just me and my bitch, uh (just me and my bitch)
Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch
Yeah, just me and my bitch (just me and my bitch)
Just me and my bitch, me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch

So when did you first start rappin'?
Um, I was like about 18 years old. Yeah, about 18��
So how did you first get started? Who influenced you?
Ain��t nobody influenced me, you know what I��m saying? I was just tired of being on the streets, you know what I��m saying? Had to get up off that, you know
I see. So where you from?
Brooklyn
Who y'all talkin' to, man?
Uhh, check it out, check it out
This, here, goes out to all the niggas
That be fuckin' mad bitches
In other niggas cribs
Thinkin' shit is sweet
Nigga creep up on your ass, hahaha
Live niggas respect it��check it

I kick flows for ya, kick down doors for ya
Even left all my motherfuckin' hoes for ya
Niggas think Frankie pussy-whipped, nigga, picture that
With a Kodak, Insta-ma-tac
We don't get down like that, lay my game down quite flat
Sweetness, where you parked at?
Petiteness but that ass fat
She got a body make a nigga wanna eat that, I'm fuckin' with you
The bitch official, doe, dick harder than a missile, yo
Try to hit, if she trippin', disappearin' like Arsenio
Yo, the bitch push a double-oh
With the five in front, probably a connivin' stunt
Y'all drive in front, I'm a peel with her
Find the deal with her, she fuck around and steal, huh?
Then we all get laced
Television's, Versace heaven, when I'm up in 'em
The shit she kicked, all the shit's legit
She get dick from a player off the New York Knicks
Nigga tricked ridiculous, the shit was plush
She's stressin' me to fuck, like she was in a rush
We fucked in his bed, quite dangerous
I'm in his ass while he playin' 'gainst the Utah Jazz
My 112, CD blast, I was past
She came twice, I came last, roll the grass
She giggle, sayin' "I'm smokin' on home-grown"
Then I heard the moan, "Honey, I'm home!"
Yep, tote chrome for situations like this
I'm up in his broad, I know he won't like this
Now I'm like, "Bitch, you better talk to him
Before this fifth put a spark to him
Fuck around, shit get dark to him, put a part through him
Lose a major part to him, arm, leg."
She beggin' me to stop but this cat gettin' closer
Gettin' hot like a toaster, I cocks the toast, uhh
Before my eyes could blink
She screams out, "Honey, bring me up somethin' to drink!"
He go back downstairs, more time to think
Her brain racin, she's tellin' me to stay patient
She don't know I'm cool as a fan
Gat in hand, I don't wanna blast her man
But I can and I will though, I'm tryna chill though
Even though situation lookin' kinda ill, yo
It came to me like a song I wrote
Told the bitch, "Gimme your scarf, pillowcase and rope"
Got dressed quick, tied the scarf around my face
Roped the bitch up, gagged her mouth with the pillowcase
Play the cut, nigga comin' off some Love Potion shit
Flash the heat on 'em, he stood emotionless
Dropped the glass screamin, "Don't blast, here's the stash!
A hundred cash! Just don't shoot my ass, please!"
Nigga pullin' mad Gs out the floor
Put stacks in a Prada knapsack, hit the door
Grab the keys to the five, call my niggas on the cell
"Bring some weed, I got a story to tell", uhh...

Yo man, y'all niggas ain't gonna believe what the fuck happened to me. Remember that bitch I left the club with man? Yo, freaky yo. I'm up in this bitch playa this bitch fuckin' run them ol' Knick ass niggas and shit. I'm up in the spot though. One of them six-five niggas, I don't know. Anyway I'm up in the motherfuckin' spot. So boom I'm up in the pussy, whatever whatever. I sparks up some lah, Pop Duke creeps up in on some, must have been rained out or something  because he's in the spot. Had me scared, had me scared, I was shook, Daddy��but I forget I had my Roscoe on me. Always. You know how we do. So anyway the nigga comes up the stairs, he creepin' up the steps, the bitch all shook she sends the nigga back downstairs to get some drinks and shit. She gettin' mad nervous, I said fuck that man! I'm the nigga, you know how we do it, nigga, ransom note style put the scarf around my motherfuckin' face. Gagged that bitch up, played the kizzack. Soon this nigga comes up in the spot, flash the Desert in his face he drops the glass. Looked like the nigga pissed on his-self or somethin, word to mother! Ahh fuck it. This nigga runs dead to the floor, peels up the carpet, start givin' me mad papers, mad papers. (I told you that bitch was a shiesty bitch cuz! Word to mother I used to fuck her cousin' but you ain't know that! You wouldn't know that shit. Really though.) I threw all that motherfuckin' money up in the Prada knapsack. Two words, I'm gone! (No doubt, no doubt... no doubt!) Yo nigga got some lye, y'all got some lye? *conversation fades out*
I used to get feels on a bitch
Now I throw shields on the dick, to stop me from that HIV shit
And niggas know they soft like a Twinkie filling
Playing the villain, prepare for this rap killing
Biggie Smalls is the illest, your style is played out
Like Arnold on that, "What you talkin' bout, Willis?"
The thrill is gone, the Black Frank White
Is here to excite and throw dick to dykes
Bitches I like em brainless, guns I like em stainless steel
I want the fucking Fortune like the Wheel
I squeeze gats till my clips is empty
Don't tempt me, you don't want to fuck with the M-E...

...T-H-O-D Man, here I am
I'll be damned if this ain't some shit
Come to spread the butter lyrics over harmony grit
It's the low killer death trap, yes I'm a jet-black ninja
Coming where you rest at, surrender
Step inside the ring, you's the number one contender
Looking cold-booty like your pussy in December
Nigga stop bitching, button up your lip and
From Method all you getting is a can of ass-whipping
Hey, I'll be kicking, you son, you doing all the yapping
Acting as if it can't happen
Your frontin' got me mad enough to touch something
Yo I'm from Shaolin Island and ain't afraid to bust something
So what you want nigga? You won't nigga
I got a 6-shooter and a horse named Trigger
It's real, '94 rugged-raw
Kicking down your goddamn door
And it goes a little something like this

Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
Everything you get you gotta work hard for it
(Honeys shake your hips) You don't stop
(And niggas pack the clips) Keep on, bitch

Verse two, coming with that Olde E brew
Meth-tical, putting niggas back in ICU
I'm lifted troop, you can bring your wack-ass crew
I got connections, I'll get that ass stuck like glue
Huh, no question, I be coming down and shit
Yo I gets rugged as a motherfucking carpet get
And niggas love it, not in the physical form but in the mental
I spark and they cells get warm
I'm not a gentle-man, I'm a Method Man
Baby accept it, utmost respect it, and
(Assume the position) Stop look and listen
I spit on your grave then I grab my Charles Dickens
Bitch

Welcome to my center, honeys feel it deep in they placenta
Cold as the pole in the winter
Far from the inventor, but I got this rap shit sewed
And when my Mac unloads I'm guaranteed another video
Ready to die, why I act that way?
Pop duke left mom duke, the faggot took the back way
So instead of making hoes suck my dick up
I used to do stick-ups, cause hoes is irritating like the hiccups
Excuse me, flows just grow through me
Like trees to branches, cliffs to avalanches
It's the praying mantis, deep like the mind of Farrakhan
A motherfucking rap phenomenon, plus
I got more Glocks and Tecs than you
I make it hot (niggas won't even stand next to you)
Nigga touch me you better bust me three times in the head
Or motherfucker's dead, you thought so

Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
Everything you get you gotta work hard for it
(Honeys shake your hips) You don't stop
(And niggas pack the clips) Keep on, bitch
Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
Everything you get you gotta work hard for it
(Honeys shake your hips) You don't stop
(And niggas pack the clips) Keep on, bitch

Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique in full effect
Punk bitch, yeah, what the fuck you want, nigga?
Ah, yeah, hell yeah (Biggie Smalls and Methical)
Bedford�CStuyvesant the livest one
My borough is thorough, recognize
9-4 comin' at you raw, Shaolin Island, yeah
I was a terror since the public school era
Bathroom passes, cutting classes, squeezing asses
Smoking blunts was a daily routine
Since 13, a chubby nigga on the scene
I used to have the trey-deuce
And the deuce-deuce in my bubblegoose
Now I got the Mac in my knapsack
Lounging black, smoking sacks up in Ac's and Sidekicks
With my sidekicks rocking fly kicks
Honeys want to chat
But all we wanna know is where the party at
And can I bring my gat?
If not, I hope I don't get shot
Better throw my vest on my chest, 'cause niggas is a mess
It don't take nothing but fronting for me to start something
Bugging and bucking at niggas like I was duck hunting
Dumbing out, just me and my crew
'Cause all we wanna do is

Party and bullshit
And party and bullshit

Hugs from the honeys, pounds from the roughnecks
Seen my man Sage that I knew from the projects
Said he had beef, asked me if I had my piece
Sure do, two .22s in my shoes
Holler if you need me, love, I'm in the house
Roam and stroll, see what the honeys is about
Moet popping, ho hopping
Ain't no stopping Big Poppa
I'm a Bad Boy
Niggas wanna front, who got your back? (Biggie!)
Niggas wanna flex, who got the gat? (Biggie!)
It ain't hard to tell I'm the East Coast overdose
Nigga you scared you're supposed to
Nigga, I toast ya, put fear in your heart
Fuck up the party before it even start
Pissy drunk, off the Henny and skunk
On some Brand Nubian shit beating down punks

Party and bullshit
And party and bullshit

Bitches in the back looking righteous
In a tight dress, I think I might just
Hit her with a little Biggie 101, how to tote a gun
And have fun with Jamaican rum
Conversation, blunts in rotation
My man Big Jock got the Glock in his waist and
We're smoking, drinking, got the hooker thinking
If money smell bad, then this nigga Biggie stinking
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eating out my palm
She grabbed my arm and said "Let's leave calm"
I'm hitting skins again
Rolled up another blunt, bought a Heineken
Niggas start to loc out, a kid got choked out
Blows was thrown and a fucking fight broke out
(Music stops
Indecipherable sounds of people yelling and arguing
Biggie breaks it up yelling "Yo, chill, man, chill!")
Can't we just all get along?
So I can put hickies on her chest like Little Shawn
Get her pissy drunk off of Dom P��rignon
And it's on, and I'm gone
That's that...

Party and bullshit, and party ...

Junior M.A.F.I.A. like to...
Uptown likes to...
Bad Boy likes to...
Brooklyn Crew likes to...
3rd Eye likes to...
Mo Bee likes to...
We like to...
Damn, is that the Chronic?
Yeah, it's that chronic boy

So you wanna be hardcore with your hat to the back
Talking about the gats in your raps
But I can't feel that hardcore appeal that you're screaming
Maybe I'm dreaming
This ain't Christopher Williams, still some
MC's got to feel one, caps I got to peel some
To let niggas know that if you fuck with big-and-heavy
I get up in that ass like a wedgie
Says who, says me the lyrical
Niggas saying, "Biggie off the street, it's a miracle!"
Left the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me
Just for niggas acting shifty
Sticks and stones break bones but the gat'll kill you quicker
Especially when I'm drunk off the liquor
Smoking funk by the boxes, packing Glocks
It's natural to eat you niggas like chocolates
The funk, baby

{"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"}
{"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"}
{"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"}
{"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"}
{"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"}
{"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"}
{"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"}
{"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"}

All I want is bitches, big-booty bitches
Used to sell crack so I could stack my riches
Now I pack gats to stop all the snitches
From staying in my business, what is this?
Relentless approach to know if I'm broke or not
Just cause I joke and smoke a lot, don't mean I don't tote the Glock
Sixteen shots for my niggas in the pen
Until we motherfucking meet again
I'm doing rhymes now, fuck the crimes now
Come on the ave, I'm real hard to find now
'Cause I'm knee-deep in the beats
In the Land Cruiser Jeep with the MAC-10 by the seats
For the jackers, the jealous-ass crackers in the (blue suits)
I'll make you prove that it's bulletproof
Hold your head 'cause when you hit the bricks
I got gin, mad blunts, and bitches sucking dick
The funk, baby

{"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"}
{"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"}
{"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"}
{"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"}
{"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"}
{"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"}
{"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"}
{"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"}

So I guess you know the story, the rap-side, crack-side
How I smoked funk, smacked bitches on the backside
Bed-Stuy, the place where my head rests
Fifty-shot clip if a nigga want test
The rocket launcher, Biggie stomped ya
High as a motherfucking helicopter
That's why I pack a Nina, fuck a misdemeanor
Beating motherfuckers like Ike beat Tina
"What's love got to do..."
When I'm ripping all through your whole crew?
Strapped like Bamboo but I don't sling guns
I got bags of funk and it's selling by the tons
Niggas want to know how I live the mack life
Making money, smoking mics like crack pipes
It's type simple and plain to maintain
I add a little funk to the brain
The funk, baby

"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"

{"I'm ready"}

As I grab the Glock, put it to your headpiece
One in the chamber, the safety is off release
Straight at your dome, holmes, I wanna see cabbage
Biggie Smalls the savage, doing your brain cells much damage
Teflon is the material for the imperial
Mic ripper, girl stripper, the Henny sipper
I drop lyrics off and on like a lightswitch
Quick to grab the right bitch and make her drive the Q
-45, Glocks and tecs are expected when I wreck shit
Respect is collected, so check it
I got techniques dripping out my buttcheeks
Sleep on my stomach so I don't fuck up my sheets, huh
My shit is deep, deeper than my grave, G
I'm ready to die and nobody can save me
Fuck the world, fuck my moms and my girl
My life is played out like a Jheri curl, I'm ready to die!

{"Yes, I'm ready"}
{"Yes, I'm ready"}
{"Yes, I'm ready"}
{"So die motherfuckers, die motherfuckers, die"}

As I sit back and look when I used to be a crook
Doing whatever it took from snatching chains to pocketbooks
A big bad motherfucker on the wrong road
I got some drugs, tried to get the avenue sewed
I want it all from the Rolexes to the Lexus
Getting paid is all I expected
My mother didn't give me what I want, what the fuck?
Now I've got a Glock making motherfuckers duck
Shit is real and hungry's how I feel
I rob and steal because that money got that whip appeal
Kicking niggas down the steps just for rep
Any repercussion lead to niggas getting wet
The infrared's at your head real steady
You better grab your guns 'cause I'm ready

{"Yes, I'm ready"}
{"Yes, I'm ready"} I'm ready to die
{"Yes, I'm ready"}
{"So die motherfuckers, die motherfuckers, die"}
Nah we ain't gonna kill your ass yet, we gonna make you suffer

In a sec, I throw the tec to your fucking neck
Everybody hit the deck, Biggie 'bout to get some rec
Quick to leave you in a coffin for slick talking
You better act like CeCe and keep on walking
When I hit ya, I split ya to the white meat
You swung a left, you swung a right, you fell to the concrete
Your face, my feet, they meet with stompin'
I'm rippin MCs from Tallahassee to Compton
Biggie Smalls on a higher plane
Niggas say I'm strange, deranged because I put the 12 gauge to your brain
Make your shit splatter
Mix the blood like batter then my pocket gets fatter
After the hit, leave you on the street with your neck slit
Down your backbone to where your motherfucking shit drip
The shit I kick, ripping through the vest
Biggie Smalls passing any test, I'm ready to die!

{"Yes, I'm ready"}
{"Yes, I'm ready"} I'm ready
{"Yes, I'm ready"}
Time to go, we gon put you out your misery motherfucker
Niggas definitely know what time it is {"Yes, I'm ready"}
The Notorious one in full effect for '93 {"Yes, I'm ready"}
Uhh, uhh {"Yes, I'm ready"}
Suicidal, I'm ready!
{"So die motherfuckers, die motherfuckers, die"}
{"Yes, I'm ready"}
{"So die motherfuckers, die motherfuckers, die"}

Now I lay me down to sleep (Yeah)
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
'Cause I'm ready to die
All y'all motherfuckers come with me if you want to
Biggie Smalls the biggest man
Rocking on and on in ninety-three, Easy Mo Bee
Third Eye and the rest of the Bad Boy fam
I don't wanna see no crying at my funeral
Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil, for you are with me
Your rod and your staff, they comfort me
You prepare a table for me, in the presence of my enemies
You anoint my head with oil, my cup overflows
Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever

Niggas in my faction don't like asking questions
Strictly gun-testing, coke-measuring
Giving pleasure in the Benz-ito
Hitting fanny, spending chips at Manny's
Hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats
Run up in your crib, wrap you up in your Polo sheets
6 up in your wig-piece, nigga decease
Muah, may you rest in peace
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours
Four-four and fifty-four draw
There's my pilot, steers my Lear; yes, my dear
Shit's official, only the Feds I fear
Here's a tissue, stop your bloodclaat crying
The kids, the dog, everybody dying, no lying
So don't you get suspicious
I'm Big Dangerous, you're just a Lil Vicious
As I leave my competition, respirator style
Climb the ladder to success escalator style
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all
Death controls y'all, Big don't fold y'all, uhh
I spit phrases that'll thrill you
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you

You're nobody 'til somebody kills you
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)
You're nobody, 'til somebody, kills you
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)

Uhh, uhh
Watch Casino, I'm the hip-hop version of Nicky Tarantino
Ask Nino, he know
Green with envy, the green tempts me
To make the rich the enemy, and take their cheese
Take their spots, take their keys, make my faculty
Live happily ever after in laughter
Hah, never seen Cristal pour faster
And to those bastards, knuckleheads squeeze lead
3 of mine dead, nothing left to do
But tear they ass to shreds, leave 'em in bloodshed
Incidents like this, I take trips
Lay up in Miami with Tamika and Tammy (huh)
Some Creole C-O bitches I met on tour
Push a peach Legend Coupe,gold teeth galore
Told me meet 'em in the future later
They'll take me shopping, buy me lavender and fuschia Gators
Introduce me to playa haters and heavy weighters
Rich bitch shit, drinking Cristal 'til they piss the shit, uhh
Thorough bitches, adapt to any borough bitches
Be in spots where they were no bitches, you feel me
Reminisce on dead friends too
You're nobody til somebody kills you

You're nobody 'til somebody kills you
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)
You're nobody, 'til somebody, kills you
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)
You're nobody, 'til somebody, kills you
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)

Uhh, uhh
You can be the shit, flash the fattest five (that's right)
Have the biggest dick, but when your shell get hit
You ain't worth spit, just a memory
Remember he used to push the champagne Range (I 'member that)
Silly cat, wore suede in the rain
Swear he put the G in game, had the Gucci frame
Before Dana Dane, thought he ran with Kane
I can't recall his name (what was his name?), you mean that kid
That nearly lost half his brain over two bricks of cocaine?
Getting his dick sucked by Crackhead Lorraine?
A fucking shame, duke's the lame, what's his name?
Dark-skin Jermaine, see what I mean?

You're nobody 'til somebody kills you
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)
You're nobody, 'til somebody, kills you
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)
You're nobody, 'til somebody, kills you
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)
"Today's agenda, got the suitcase up in the Sentra
Go to room 112, tell 'em Blanco sent ya
Feel the strangest if no money exchanges
I got these kids in Ranges to leave them niggas brainless
All they tote is stainless, you just remain as
Calm as possible, make the deal go through
If not, here's 12 shots, we know how you do
Please make your killings clean, slugs up in between
They eyes like True Lies, kill 'em and flee the scene
Just bring back the coke or the cream
Or else, your life is on the shelf, we mean this, Frank
Them cats we fucking with put bombs in your mom's gas tank"
"Let's get this money baby, they shady, we get shady
Dress up like ladies and burn 'em with dirty .380s
Then they come to kill our babies, that's all out
I got gats that blow the wall out, clear them all out
Fuck the fallout, word to Stretch I bet they pussy
The seven digits push me, fucking real, here's the deal
I got a hundred bricks, 14-5 apiece (uh-huh)
Enough to cop a 6, buy the house on the beach (uh-huh)
Supply the peeps with Jeeps, brick apiece, capisce?
Everybody getting cream, no one considered a leech
Think about it now, that's damn near 1.5
I kill them all, I'll be set for life," "Frank, pay attention
These motherfuckers is henchmen, renegades
If you die they still get paid, extra probably
Fuck a robbery, I'm the boss
Promise you won't rob 'em", "I promise!"
But, of course, you know I had my fingers crossed

(Niggas bleed just like us) Picture me being scared
Of a nigga that breathe the same air as me
(Niggas bleed just like us) Picture me being shook
We can both pull burners, make the motherfucking beef cook
(Niggas bleed just like us) Picture a nigga hiding
My life in that man's hands while he just deciding
(Niggas bleed just like us) I'd rather go toe-to-toe
With all of y'all; running ain't in my protocol, uhh

Since it's on, I call my nigga Arizona Ron
From Tucson, push the black Yukon
Usually had the slow grooves on, mostly rock the Isley
Stupid as a youngin, chose not the moves wisely
Sharper with game, him and his crooks caught a Jooks
Heard it was sweet, about 350 apiece
Ron bought a truck, two bricks laid in the cut
His peeps got bucked, got locked the fuck up
That's when Ron vanished, came back, speaking Spanish
Lavish habits, two rings, twenty carats
He's a criminal, nigga made America's Most
Killed his baby mother brother, slit his throat
The nigga got bagged with the toast
Weeded, took it to trial, beat it
Now he feel he undefeated, he mean it
Nothing to lose tattooed around his gun wounds
"Everything to gain" embedded in his brain
And me? I feel the same, for this money, you dying
Especially if my daughter crying, I ain't lying
Y'all know the science

(Niggas bleed just like us) Picture me being scared
Of a nigga that breathe the same air as me
(Niggas bleed just like us) Picture me being shook
We can both pull burners, make the motherfucking beef cook
(Niggas bleed just like us) Picture a nigga hiding
My life in that man's hands while he just deciding
(Niggas bleed just like us) I'd rather go toe-to-toe
With all of y'all; running ain't in my protocol, uhh

We agreed, to go in shooting is silly
Because niggas could be hiding in showers with MAC-millis
So I freaked them, the telly manager was Puerto Rican
Gloria from Astoria, I went to war with her peeps in '91
Stole a gun from my workers
And they took drugs, they tried to jerk us
We blazed they place, long story, Glo' seen't my face
Got shook, thought a nigga was coming for the safe
Now she breaking, "Shut up, 112, what's shaking?"
"A Jamaican, some bitches, I swear they look gay
And a black Range Rover been outside all day
If it's trouble let me know, I'll be on my way
Please, I got kids to feed, I done seen you make niggas bleed
Nightmares this bitch don't need"
"Ron, get the gasoline, this spot, we about to blow this
Get the cash before the cops and Range Rover cats notice"
Room 112, right by the staircase, perfect place
When they evacuate, they meet they fate
"Ron, pass the gasoline", the nigga passed me kerosene
Fuck it, it's flameable, my hunger is unexplainable
Strike the match, just what I expected
The dread kid ejected in seconds, and here come two
Opposite sexes, one black, one Malaysian
We in the hallway waiting patient
As soon as she hit the door, we start blasting
I saw her brains hit the floor, Ron laughing, I swear to God
I hit Maxi Priest at least twelve times in the chest
Spinned around, shot the chink in the breast
She crying, headshots put her to rest
Pop open them briefcases, nothing but Franklin faces
The spot's hot, sprinklers, alarm systems
That's when other guests start to slip in
It's time for us to get to dipping
I know them niggas in the Range is on they way up
Flipping, pistol gripping, I load the clip in
The hallway got real loud and crowded
They walked right past us, I don't know how they allowed it
The funny thing about it, through all the excitement
They Range got towed, they double-parked by a hydrant
Stupid motherfuckers (hahahaha)
Yo!

Head so hard, that your hat can't fit you
Either I'm with ya or against ya
Format venture, back through that maze I sent ya
Talking to the rap inventor
Nigga with the game tight, fifth of that flame right
Spell my name right, B-I, double-G, I-E
Iced out, lights out, me and Cease-a-Leo
Getting head from some chick he know
See it's all about the cheddar, nobody do it better
Going back to Cali, strictly for the weather
Women and the weed - sticky green
No seeds bitch please, Poppa ain't soft
Dead up in the hood, ain't no love lost
Got me mixed up, you drunk them licks up
Mad 'cause I got my dick sucked
And my balls licked, forfeit, the game is mine
I'ma spell my name one more time, check it
It's the, N-O, T-O, R-I, O
U-S, you just, lay down, slow
Recognize a real Don when you see one
Sipping on booze in the House of Blues

I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (going back to Cali)
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (going back to Cali)
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (going back to Cali)
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (going back to Cali)

If I got to choose a coast I got to choose the East
I live out there, so don't go there
But that don't mean a nigga can't rest in the West
See some nice breast in the West
Smoke some nice sess in the West, y'all niggas is a mess
Thinking I'm gon stop, giving L.A props
All I got is beef with those that violate me
I shall annihilate thee
Case closed, suitcase filled with clothes
Linens and things, I begin things
Beeper start to flash, 818's, 213's
313's, B.I.G
Frequently floss hoes at Roscoe's
If I wanna squirt her, take her to Fatburger
Spend about a week on Venice Beach
Sippin Crist-o, with some freaks from Frisco

I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (going back to Cali)
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (going back to Cali)
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (going back to Cali)
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (going back to Cali)

Cali got gunplay, models on the runway
Scream Biggie Biggie gimme One More Chance
I be whipping on the freeway, the NYC way
On the celly-celly with my homeboy Lance
Pass hash from left to right
Only got five blunts left to light, I'm set tonight
Met a bitch at the Versace store
Said she suck it 'til I ain't got no more, only in L.A
Bust on bitches be-lly, rub it in they tummy
Lick it, say it's yummy, then fuck your man
What's your plan, is it to rock the Tri-State?
Almost gold, five Gs a show date
Or do you wanna see about seven digits?
Fuck hoes exquisite, Cali, great place to visit

I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (going back to Cali)
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (going back to Cali)
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (going back to Cali)
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (going back to Cali)
Mmmmmmmmm-HMM
See.. {*echoes*}
I told you.. {*echoes*}
 See, I told y'all muh'fuckers
 Yo yo.. that stupid nigga man
 I told y'all to stop!
 He fucked up, yo..
 I pray for you to stop
 Yo, yo yo yo, yo.. yo.. yo..
Yo, yo yo yo, yo..
 But no, you didn't stop
 Yo.. yo..
 And now, we won't stop

Time, time for you to die
As I kiss.. yo'.. ass.. goodnight

I make your mouthpiece obese like Della Reese
When I release you lose teeth like Lil' Cease
Nigga please, blood floods your dungarees
And that's just the half of my warpath
Laugh now cry later, I rhyme greater
Than the average playa hater and spectators
Buy my CD twice, they see me in the streets
They be like, "Yo he nice, but that's on the low though"
Be the cats with no dough, tried to play me at my show
I pull out .44s and go up in they clothes
Short-change niggas, snort 'caine niggas
Extortion came quicker, bought the Range nigga
Ya still tickle me, I used to be as strong as Ripple be
'Til Lil' Cease crippled me
Now I play hard like my girl's nipples be
The game sour like a pickle be, y'all know the rules
Move from BK to New Jeruz
Thinkin' 'bout all the planes we flew, bitches we ran through
Now the year's new, I lay my game flat
I want my spot back, take two
Motherfuckers mad 'cause I blew, niggas envious
Too many niggas on my dick, shit's strenuous
When my men bust, you just move with such stamina
Slugs missed ya, I ain't mad at cha (we ain't mad at cha)
Blood rushin', concussions ain't nothin'
Catch cases, come out fronting, smokin' something
Sippin' White Russians, bitch in the Benz bumpin'
I laced it with the basic, six TVs a system
Knockin' Ma$e shit, face it, we hard to hit
Guard ya shit, 'fore I stick you for your re-up
Wipe the pee up, lick shots, woke your seed up
Go in the ashtray, spark the weed up, long kiss

Hell, we don��t give a fuck
We just absolutely don��t give a fuck
Because there ain��t no love here
There ain��t no love here
You know, we gon' keep doin' what we do
We gon' keep fuckin' you up
I'ma keep stomping your motherfucking head in
You fucking bitch

Time, time for you to die
As I kiss.. yo'.. ass.. goodnight
Time, time for you to die
As I kiss.. yo'.. ass.. goodnight

Uhh.. I'm flamin' gats, aimin' at
These fuckin' maniacs, put my name in raps
What part the game is that? Like they hustle backwards
I smoke Backwoods and Dutchies, you can't touch me
Try to rush me, slugs go, touchy-touchy
You're bleedin' lovely, with yo' spirit above me
Or beneath me, your whole life you live sneaky
Now you rest eternally sleepy, you burn when you creep me
Rest where the worms and the weak be
My nine flies, baptize rap guys
With the Holy Ghost, I put holes in most
You hold your toast shaky, slippin' tryna break me
Look what you made me do, brains blew
My team in the marine-blue Six Coup��
Skied it out, weeded out, cleanin' out
The block for distances, givin' long kisses, bitch

Only I can do now, I say a prayer for you
You know, that��s the only thing I can do, just pray for your mind
Because, see your mind is in control of your heart
Where it's supposed to be the other way around
Your heart has got to control your mind
So now, I have no feelings for you
You have made me cruel

Time, time for you to die
As I kiss.. yo'.. ass.. goodnight
Time, time for you to die
As I kiss.. yo'.. ass.. goodnight

Frank White the menacin', Chron Chron's the medicine
I got the lettuce and you turn green like cucumber skin
Got the new Hummer in the summer when
I was a newcomer then, drugs and MAC-10s
Hugs from fake friends, make ends they hate you
Be broke, girls won't date you
That's why I relate to, choke your ass out 'til your face blue
Make you, open the safe too
No matter how you call it (how you call it), this brolic alcoholic
Like his weed greened out, like his brick solid
Distribute to kids who take heart like Valentine
Drink Ballantine all the time
Slugs hit your chest, tap your spine, flatline
Heard through the grapevine, you got fucked four times
Damn that three to nine, fucked you up for real though
Sling steel slow, as for remorse, we feel no

Time, time for you to die
As I kiss.. yo'.. ass.. goodnight
Time, time for you to die
As I kiss.. yo'.. ass.. goodnight
Time, time for you to die
As I kiss.. yo'.. ass.. goodnight

See the fucked up thing is that I love you
You know what I��m saying
It��s just in my nature to love you
I can��t hate you
��Cause its not in my nature to hate you
You know, I don��t know
Maybe I��m a different type of individual
But you have me on a line
And there��s a thin line between love and hate
And God-forbid I cross that line
Cause I��m not gon�� give a fuck
I��m telling you right motherfucking now
The shit that ya��ll done started
Is never gonna stop!
We are never gonna stop!
And we��re not talking about no other rappers
We��re talking about you, motherfucker!
You know who I��m talking to
We comin' for you
We comin' for you
Laughs
Feels so good
I'ma make you love me baby, baby
Biggie Smalls is the illest
What?
Biggie Smalls is the illest

Live from Bedford-Stuyvesant, the livest one
Representing BK to the fullest
Gats, I pull it
Bastards ducking when Big be bucking
Chickenheads be clucking, in my bathroom fucking
It ain't nothing
They know BIG be handling
With the MAC in the Ac' door paneling
Bandaging MC's
Oxygen they can't breathe
Mad tricks up the sleeve
Wear boxers so my dick can breathe
Breeze through in the Q -
45 by my side, lyrical high
And those that rushes my clutches get put on crutches
Get smoked like dutches from the master
Hate to blast ya but I have to
You see I smoke a lot
Your life is played out like Kwame
And them fucking polka dots
Who rock the spot, Biggie
You know how the weed go, unbelievable

It's unbelievable
Biggie Smalls is the illest

B-I-G, G-I-E
A.K.A., B. I. G
Get it? Biggie
Also known as the bon appetit
Rappers can't sleep need sleeping
Big keep creeping
Bullets heat-seeking, casualties need treating
Dumb rappers need teaching
Lesson A: Don't fuck with B-I
That's that "Oh I, thought he was wack"
Oh come come now, why y'all so dumb now
Hunt me or be hunted
I got three hundred and fifty-seven ways
To simmer saut��, I'm the winner all day
Lights get dimmer down Biggie's hallway
My forte causes Caucasians to say
He sounds demented
Car weed scented, if I said it, I meant it
Bite my tongue for no one
Call me evil, or unbelievable

It's unbelievable
Biggie Smalls is the illest

Buck shots out the sun roof of Lexus coupes
Leave no witnesses, what you think this is?
Ain't no amateurs here
I damage and tear, MC's fear me
They too near not to hear me
Clearly, I'm the triple beam dream
One thousand grams of uncut to the gut
It seems fucked up, the way I touched up the grill
Trying to play gorilla, when you ain't no killer
The gat's by your liver, your upper lip quiver
Get ready to die, tell God I said hi
And throw down some ice for the nicest MC
Niggas know the steelo, unbelievable

It's unbelievable
Biggie Smalls is the illest
Uh, I like that, you like that?
Here's another one, and another one
And another one, and another one
Uh
Whaat, whaat (c'mon)

You must be used to me spending (uh, uh)
And all that sweet wining and dining
Well, I'm fucking you tonight
Uh, Here's another one
And another one
Uh, uh, what

Some say the X, make the sex spec-tacular
Make me lick you from yo' neck to your back, then ya
Shivering, tongue delivering
Chills up that spine, that ass is mine
Skip the wine and the candlelight, no Cristal tonight
If it's all right with you, we fucking (that's cool)
Deja vu, the blunts sparked, finger fucking in the park
Pissy off Bacardi Dark
Remember when I used to play between your legs?
You begged for me to stop because you know where it would head
Straight to your mother's bed
Not the Marriott, we be lucky if we find a spot
Next to your sister, damn I really missed the
Way she used to rub my back, when I hit that
Way she used to giggle when your ass would wiggle
Now I know you're used to suites at the Parker Meridien
Trips to the Caribbean, but tonight, no ends

You must be (uh) used to me spending
You must be used to me (uh)
And all that sweet wining and dining (what)
Well, I'm fucking you tonight
Here's another one (fucking you tonight)
And another one (no doubt baby)

And all that sweet wining and dining
Well, I'm fucking you tonight
Here's another one (fucking you)
And another one (no doubt about it babe, fucking you)
Uh, uh

Girl you look fine
Like a wide face Rolex, you just shine
I like that waistline
Let me hit that from behind, which wall you wanna climb
My style genuine, girl I love you long time
I got you pinned up, with your fucking limbs up
All because you like the way my Benz was rimmed up
Bitch keep yo' chin up, please watch me do thee
Nasty, like it when you make it move fast mami
I like it when you tro' it pon me
No love making, strictly back breaking
Cease know, all his hoes, go to my door
Then they go to his flo', to fuck some more
So no, caviar, Shark Bar, uh-uh
Strictly sex that's sweaty and leftover spaghetti
I know you used to slow CD's and Dom P's
But tonight it's eight tracks and six-packs while I hit that

You must be used to me spending
(You must be, used to me)
And all that sweet wining and dining (spending all his money baby, on you)
Well, I'm fucking you tonight
Can you feel me?, 'cause I can feel you
Can you feel me?, 'cause I can feel you
You must be used to me spending
You must be used to me
And all that sweet wining and dining
Well, I'm fucking you tonight
(fucking you tonight)
Can you feel me? (make ya feel so right),'cause I can feel you (baby come to me)
Can you feel me (give me what I need), R. Kelly take me to the bridge

Let's stop the bullshit, baby
Let me take you to the spot, fit you hot
So you wanna be with me (say what), Puff Daddy (that's right)
B.I.G. (let's go), bring that ass to me

You must be used to me spending
And all that sweet wining and dining
Well, I'm fucking you tonight

And all that sweet wining and dining (spending money all of the time, on you)
Well, I'm fucking you tonight
No matter what you may say, babe
Giving it to you, any way I possibly can
You must be used to me spendin'
And all that sweet wining and dining
Well, I'm fucking you tonight, oohhh baby, sugar, honey

Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right
Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right

Remember back in the days when niggas had waves
Cazal shades and corn braids
Pitching pennies, honeys had the high-top jellies
Shooting skelly, motherfuckers was all friendly
Lounging at the barbecues, drinking brews
With the neighborhood crews, hanging on the avenues
Turn your pages to 1993
Niggas is getting smoked, G: believe me
Talk slick, you get your neck slit quick
Cause real street niggas ain't having that shit
Toting Tecs for rep
Smoking blunts in the project hallways
Shooting dice all day
Wait for niggas to step up on some fighting shit
We get hype and shit and start lighting shit
So step away with your fist-fight ways
Motherfucker, this ain't back in the days
But you don't hear me though

Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right

No more coco-levio 1, 2, 3
1, 2, 3... all it is to me, is a mystery
I hear you motherfuckers talk about it
But I stay seeing bodies with the motherfucking chalk around it
And I'm down with the shit too
For the stupid motherfuckers want to try to use Kung-Fu
Instead of a MAC-10, he tried scrapping
Slugs in his back and that's what the fuck happens
When you sleep on the street
Little motherfuckers with heat wanna leave a nigga six feet deep
And we coming to the wake
To make sure the crying and commotion ain't a motherfucking fake
Back in the days our parents used to take care of us
Look at 'em now, they even fuckin' scared of us
Calling the city for help because they can't maintain
Damn, shit done changed

Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right

If I wasn't in the rap game
I'd probably have a key knee-deep in the crack game
Because the streets is a short stop
Either you're slinging crack rock or you got a wicked jump shot
Shit, it's hard being young from the slums
Eating 5 cent gums, not knowing where your meal's coming from
And now the shit's getting crazier and major
Kids younger than me, they got the Sky brand pagers
Going out of town, blowing up
Six months later, all the dead bodies showing up
It make me wanna grab the 9 and the shotty
But I gotta go identify the body
Damn, what happened to the summertime cookouts
Every time I turn around, a nigga getting took out
Shit, my Momma got cancer in her breast
Don't ask me why I'm motherfucking stressed, things done changed

Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right

No big up our gun men, seen? (big up, big up)
Cuh dis ah 94' when ah RAA fi kill people and kyaan dun
Nuh waan pussy hole hold di kaanah
Watch this, lawd

Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
Informer lone keep informer friend

Nineteen-seventy something, nigga I don't sweat the date
My moms is late so I had to plan my escape
Out the skins, in this world of fly girls
Tanqueray and Hennessy until I cold hurl
Ten months in this gut, what the fuck
I wish moms would hurry up so I could get buck
Wild juvenile ripping mics and shit
New York, New York, ready for the likes of this
Then came the worst date, May 21st
2:19, that's when my momma water burst
No spouse in the house so she rode for self
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help
Umbilical cord's wrapped around my neck
I'm seeing my death and I ain't even took my first step
I made it out, I'm bringing mad joy
The doctor looked and said, "He's going to be a bad boy"

Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
Informer lone keep informer friend

Now I'm thirteen, smoking blunts, making cream
On the drug scene, fuck a football team:
Risking ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen
Hearing the coach scream ain't my lifetime dream!
I mean I want to blow up, stack my dough up
So school I didn't show up, it fucked my flow up
Mom said that I should grow up and check myself
Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself
Put the drugs on the shelf? Nah, couldn't see it
Scarface, King of New York, I want to be it
Rap was secondary, money was necessary
Until I got incarcerated--kinda scary
C74-Mark 8 set me straight
Not able to move behind the great steel gate
Time to contemplate, damn, where did I fail?
All the money I stacked was all the money for bail

Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
Informer lone keep informer friend
Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
Informer lone keep informer friend

Ninety-four, now I explore new horizons
Mama smile when she see me, that's surprising
Honeys is tantalizing, they freak all night
Peep ducking cops on the creep all night
As I open my eyes and realizing I changed
Not the same deranged child stuck up in the game
And to my niggas living street life
Learn to treat life to the best, put stress to rest
Still tote your vest man, niggas be tripping
In the streets without a gat? Nah, nigga you're slipping
If I'm pimping on The F with weed on my breath
Original hustler with the muffler on the Tec
Respect to the macks in the Ac's
To the freaks in the Jeeps, lick shots to my peeps

Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
Informer lone keep informer friend
Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
Informer lone keep informer friend

Nigga was Motherfuckin' hyped up

Let's go deep into the phrase, feel the sun rays
Off the forehead, everything is real
Biggie put me on this joint, so I'ma be the big wheel
Watch it spin, hey dad, placed your bet on seven
Peace to 106, 108, 110 and 111th
Hey Biggie, I understand you're from Brooklyn
With .22s in your shoes, yo, keep this joint cooking

Well, why not blow up the spot with Sadat?
Release the brainstorm to make your motherfucking brain warm
A strange form, something kind of lyrical
Biggie the bastard, Sadat's kind of spiritual
Well, in God we trust, guns I bust
Got that disgusting, sewer-style dumping
And, uh, do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that I bring?
Make an MC wanna sing for a living
Take the beatdown we fucking giving
C'mon, motherfucker!

Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on

What? Niggas want drama, putting work on my block
When I told y'all last week that shit was too hot
Selling deuces and treys cuts my dimes
Somebody don't get paid, somebody's block get sprayed
Reaction is delayed as ya run down the block
Caught one in your chest, your breath come in spurts
Hey yo, Biggie, tell these niggas I'ma hit 'em where it hurts
The Big City, it don't spare no bodies
Call me papi chulo, to all the Spanish mamis
I'm about ten blunts down, drank three or four stouts
Seen five fat asses, passed this bitch with glasses
Hey, your money, that's your stock, yo bitch, pass the Glock
I'ma tell them, "It can happen, don't play me with that rap shit"
Life is real, so Biggie take the steel

Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on

I got seven Mac-11's, about eight .38's
Nine 9's, ten Mac-10's the shits never end
You can't touch my riches
Even if you had MC Hammer and them 357 bitches
Biggie Smalls, the millionaire, the mansion, the yacht
The two weed spots, the two hot Glocks
Huh, that's how I got the weed spot
I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the Lambsbread
Lil' Gotti got the shotty to your body
So don't resist or you might miss Christmas
I tote guns, I make number runs
I give MCs the runs dripping
When I throw my clip in the AK, I slay from far away
Everybody hit the D-E-C-K
My slow flows remarkable, peace to Matteo
Now we smoke weed like Tony Montana sniff the yayo
That's crazy blunts, mad L's
My voice excels from the avenue to jail cells
Oh my God I'm dropping shit like a pigeon
I hope you're listening, smacking babies at they christening
So you better grab your pistol
'Cause if you sit still, I'm gonna make your fucking shit spill
And I'm talking 'bout buckets, why did I have to do it?
Sadat said fuck it, you got a gun, nigga bust it
'Cause I got mo' shots to pop ya
Big Poppa, breaking you off something proper
Signing off is the hardcore rap singer
AKA crack slinger, bring it any time nigga

Come on, motherfuckers, come on

Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died
Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died

When I die, fuck it I wanna go to hell
Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven wit' the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Tims and black hoodies
God will probably have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wished she got a fuckin' abortion

Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died
Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died

I swear to God I just want to slit my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit
And squeeze, until the bed's, completely red
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fuckin' buddah head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't
I can't believe suicide's on my fuckin' mind
I want to leave, I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
Naw you wouldn't understand
You see its kinda like the crack did to Pookie, in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back
Should I die on the train track, like Remo in Beatstreet
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me
My baby momma kissed me but she glad I'm gone
She knew me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies

Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died
Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died

I reach my peak, I can't speak
Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak
I'm sick of niggas lyin', I'm sick of bitches hawkin'
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin'
Ah, ah!
I'm sittin' in the crib dreamin' about Lear jets and coupes
The way Salt shoops and how they sell records like Snoop - (oops!)
I'm interrupted by a doorbell
3:52 - who the hell is this?
I gets up quick, cocks my shit
Stop the dogs from barkin', then proceed to walkin'
It's a face that I seen before
My nigga Sing, we used to sling on the 16th floor
Check it!
I look deeper; I see blood up on his sneakers
And his fist gripped a chrome four-fifth
So I dip
Nigga, is you creepin' or speakin'?
He tells me C-Rock just got hit up at the Beacon
I opens up the door, pitiful:
"Is he in critical?"
Retaliation for this one won't be minimal
'Cause I'm a criminal
Way before the rap shit
Bust the gat shit; Puff won't even know what happened
If it's done smoothly, silencers on the Uzi
Stash in the hooptie, my alibi: any cutie
With a booty that done fuck Big Pop
Head spinnin', reminiscin' 'bout my man C-Rock

Somebody gotta die
If I go, you got to go
Somebody got to die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody got to die
Nobody got to know
That I killed yo' ass in the mist, bitch
Somebody got to die
If I go, you got to go
Somebody gotta die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody got to die
Nobody got to know
That I killed yo' ass in the mist, bitch

Uhh, fillin' clips, he explained our situation
Precisely, so we know exactly what we facin'
"Some kid named Jason
In a Honda station wagon
Was braggin', about how much loot and crack he stackin'
Rock had a grip so they formed up a clique
A small crew, 'round the time I was locked up with you"
"True indeed"
"But yo nigga, let me proceed
Don't fill them clips too high
Give them bullets room to breathe
Damn, where was I? Yeah
Went outta town, blew the fuck up
D-Roc went home
And Jay got stuck the fuck up
Hit him twice, caught him right for the Persian white
Pistol whipped his kids and taped up his wife (niggas is trife)
He figured Rock set 'em up, no question
Wet 'em up no less
Than 50 shots in his direction" (uhh)
"How many shots?"
"Man nigga, I seen mad holes"
"What kinda gats?"
"Hecklers, Kochs, and Calicos
But fuck that
I know where all them niggas rest at
In the buildin' hustlin'
And they don't be strapped
Supreme in black is downstairs, the engine runnin'
Find a bag to put the guns in
And c'mon if you're comin'

Somebody gotta die
If I go, you got to go
Somebody got to die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody got to die
Nobody got to know
That I killed yo' ass in the mist, bitch
Somebody got to die
If I go, you got to go
Somebody gotta die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody got to die
Nobody got to know
That I killed yo' ass in the mist, bitch

Exchanged hugs and pounds before the throw down
How it's gon' go down?
Lay these niggas low-down
"Slow down, ah, fuck all that plannin' shit
Run up in they cribs and make the cats abandon ship!"
See niggas like you do ten-year bids
Miss the nigga they want and murder innocent kids
Not I
One nigga's in my eye, that's Jason
Ain't no slugs gonna be wasted
Revenge I'm tastin' at the tip of my lips
I can't wait to fill my clip in his hips
"Pass the chocolate, Thai!"
Sing ain't lie
There's Jason with his back to me
Talkin' to his faculty
I start to get a funny feeling
Put the mask on in case this nigga start squealin'
Scream his name out: ("Ay yo, playboy!")
Squeezed six, nothin' shorter
Nigga turned around holdin' his daughter
As I sit back relax, steam a blunt, sip a Becks
Think about the sexy singers that I wanna sex
I'd probably go to jail for fucking Patti LaBelle
Ooh Regina Belle, she'd probably do me swell
Jasmine Guy was fly, Mariah Carey's kinda scary
Wait a minute, what about my honey Mary?
Them jeans they fitting like a glove
I had a crush on you since Real Love
Hold your horses, I'mma show you who the boss of intercourse is
Sex, I'm taking no losses
Even groups like SWV and TLC
Can't see B.I.G. with telepathy
The recipe, a pinch of hardcore with a gun
Pimping ain't easy but it sure is fun
When I bust my nuts I bust 'em one by one
So what's the 4-1-1 hun?

Dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
I'm just playing... I'm saying
Dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
I'm just playing... I'm saying
Dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
I'm just playing... I'm saying
Dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
I'm just playing... I'm saying

I'll put Chante Moore pussy in stitches
I'll fuck RuPaul before I fuck them ugly ass Xscape bitches
You can 76 the 69, try 68
Make Raven-Symon�� call date rape
Only cause Im paid, I'm fucking all of Jade
And my DJ Zhane she likes it when they say
"Everybody move your body"
Got Whitney Houston boosting from Bobby
As I bust the cherry of Monica and Terry
Backshots to Chaka, I know that pussy hairy
Sade, ooh, I know that pussy tight
Smack Tina Turner give her flashbacks of Ike
Smoke a stoge, fucking En Vogue because it's four of them
Jimmy hats for Patra, I'm using all of them
(What about Toni Braxton?)
If that bitch give me action...guaranteed satisfaction

Dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
I'm just playing... I'm saying
Dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
I'm just playing... I'm saying
Dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
I'm just playing... I'm saying
Dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
I'm just playing... I'm saying
{*dice game intro*}

Uhh, uhh
Uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh, what
Hah, what, how real is this?
Uhh, uhh, how real is this?
What? Uhh, what?
Uhh

We push the hottest V's, peel fast
Through the city, play Monopoly with real cash
Me and Biggie and the models be shaking they sadiddy ass
And Prada be something you cats got to see
And the watches be all types and shapes of stones
Being broke is childish and I'm quite grown
Run up in the club with the ice on, me and Paisan
Scope the spot out, see something nice and I'm gone
You cats is home screaming the fight's on
I'm in the fifteen hundred seats, watching Tyson
Same night, same fight
But one of us cats ain't playing right, I let you tell it
People place yourselves in the shoes of two felons
And tell me you won't ball every chance you get
And any chance you hit, we live for the moment
Makes sense don't it? Now make dollars
Cats pop bottles, bone chicks that favor Idalis
And rack up frequent flight mileage

Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey
I love the dough, more than you know
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey

I'm popping Magnums while Jigga bag something
Watch is platinum, got jet lag from
Flights back and forth, pop corks of the best grapes
Make the best CDs and the best tapes
Don't forget the vinyl, take girls break spinals
Biggie be Richie like Lionel, shit
You seen the Jes��s, dipped to H classes
Ice project off lights, chick flashes
Blind your broke asses, even got rocks in the beards and moustaches
Rock top fashions
Ain't shit changed, except the number after the dot
On the Range, way niggas look at me now, kinda strange
I hate y'all too
Rather be in Carribean sands with Rachel
It's unreal, out the blue Frank White got sex appeal
Bitches used to go, "Ewww!"
Still tote steel, I'm trying to see five mil off the single, for real
You ain't fazing the amazing
While your gun's raising, mine is blazing
See you on see me all talking to sweetness
Take it for weakness and leave quick
Blocka, Roc-A-Fella, Bad Boy collabo
Two MCs with mad dough, you know

I love the dough, more than you know
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey (I love the dough)
I love the dough, more than you know (gonna let it show)
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey

Miraculous, pockets stay full
Niggas skip the bull 'cause we matadors
Snatch the P89s that we pack in the drawers
And we clap the doors of your Acuras
Snap like cameras on amateurs
Make you all dance, hold a hammer to yours
Jig and Big rock ice, no cracks or flaws
Everybody got a part to play, back to yours
Run up in your crib now, crack your doors
Watch the real players live, it's a habit to floss
Play the charts like The Beatles, y'all adapt you lost
And toast Cristal on behalf of y'all
Too bad for y'all
Ain't too many as bad as yours truly
Do we, we laugh at y'all
Little bastards y'all

Uhh, uhh
We hit makers with acres
Roll shakers in Vegas, you can't break us
Lost chips on Lakers, gassed off Shaq
Country house, tennis courts on horseback
Riding, deciding cracked crab or lobster
Who say mobsters don't prosper?
Niggas is actors, niggas deserve Oscars
Me I'm critically acclaimed, slug passed your brain
Reminisce on dames whose coochie used to stink
When we rocked house pieces and puffy Gucci links
Now we buy homes in unfamiliar places
Tito smile every time he see our faces
Cases catch more than outfielders
Half these rapping cats ain't seen war
Couldn't score if they had point game, they lame
Speak my name, I make 'em dash like Dame
(We love the dough...)

I love the dough, more than you know (gonna let it show)
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey
I love the dough, more than you know (gonna let it show)
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey
I love the dough, more than you know (ah yeah)
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey
I love the dough, more than you know
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey
The Biggie Duets! (Uhh!)

Back of my mind I hope she swallow

Reach the gate, hungry just ate

Conversate, sex on the first date
I state, "You know what you do to me"
She starts off, "But I don't usually"
Then I whipped it out, rubber no doubt
Step out, show me what you all about
Fingers in your mouth, open up your blouse
Pull your G-string down South

Motherfuckers don't even know you, and they don't like you

Uhh, I dream filthy
My moms and pops mixed me with Jamaican Rum and Whiskey
Huh, what a set off
Shoulda pushed him dead off, wipe the sweat off (uhh)
'Cause in this world I'm dead off, squeeze lead off
Benz sped off, ain't no shook hands in Brook-land
Army fatigues bring fatigue, to enemies, look man
You wanna see me locked up, shot up
Moms crouched up over the casket, screamin' "bastard"
Cryin', know my friends is lyin'
Y'all know who killed him, filled him with the lugers from they Rugers
Or they Desert, dyin' ain't the shit but it's pleasant
Kinda quiet, watch my niggas bring the riot
Givin' cats the opposite of diets
You gain thirty pounds when you die no lie, lazy eye
I was high when they hit me, took a few cats with me
Shit, I need the company (uh-huh)
Apologies in order, to T'Yanna my daughter
If it was up to me you would be with me
Sorta like Daddy Dearest, my vision be the clearest
Silencers so you can't hear it
Competition still fear it, shit don't ask me
I went from ashy to nasty to classy, and still

That's not all, MC's have the gall
To pray and pray for my downfall (they pray)
Pray and pray for my downfall (they pray)
Pray and pray for my downfall (they pray, they pray)

This goes out to cats, fingers in they ass again
Fifty dollar half-a-men, daydreamin'
Fuck around get wet like semen, your whole team and
Be more gone than Freeman
I took the cream and, moved to new places, new faces
Fuck the screw faces, 'cause when I flip
I make the papers, dangerous, we Goodfellas
Niggas can't bang with us, try to do me
My crew be unruly (what)
Some old school cats that call gats toolies
Call blacks moolies, think it's cool to smoke woolies
And fuck without rubbers (what)
Specialize in killin' wives and grandmothers
Who ya trusting, shit
When Frank start bustin', Frank start somethin'
Killin' ya gently, God meant me, to push a Bentley
Me and Sean Combs takin' broads home
On the phone with the chip, with these Cristal chicks
'Bout to make our own porno flicks, my life's the shit

That's not all, MC's have the gall (they pray, they pray)
To pray and pray for my downfall (they pray)
Pray and pray for my downfall (they pray)
Pray and pray for my downfall

To pray and pray for my downfall (they pray)

Pray and pray for my downfall, fall

We used to hold the gold, now we floss with diamonds
Niggas want my team to stop shinin'
Pray my fame start declinin'
Whinin' like girlies (stop whinin' you bitches)
We been around the world twice, all we got is mo' ice
And mo' nice, sacrifice your heart
Lexus with the automatic start (what)
Fifty shots'll tear your club apart
Eatin' shrimp �� la carte, with some bitches from Brussels
Eatin' clams and mussels
Uhh, octopus, pretty face no waist
I just want the bush, so I can mack it
Give her a package to push, cause I work them hoes
Pendejos I show you how to play them hoes
Can you just visualize it
Before I go to sleep I check the beds and the closet
So I can sleep safe, not too many keep a mil' in the briefcase
Infrareds help me sleep safe, but wait

That's not all, MC's have the gall (they pray, they pray)
To pray and pray for my downfall (they pray)
Pray and pray for my downfall (they pray)
Pray and pray for my downfall, fall

See, y'all motherfuckers live off of negativity
What y'all niggas need to get through your motherfuckin' heads

Motherfuckin' level -- we don't give a fuck
About what you think about us how you feel about us
What you got to say about us
We gon keep doing our motherfuckin' thing
From now 'til the year three thousand bitches!
You can't breathe, you can't sleep, you can't eat
Without thinkin' about us!
And without thinkin' about us on your mind
We gon' haunt your asses MOTHERFUCKERS!

That's not all, MC's have the gall (they pray, they pray)
To pray and pray for my downfall (they pray)

Uh yeah, Bad Boy baby
Ralph Tresvant
Biggie Smalls
Listen...

Uh yeah baby oooooooh, listen to me, oh yeaaaah

When it comes to sex, I'm similar to the thriller in Manila
Honeys call me Bigga the condom filler
Whether it's stiff tongue or stiff dick
Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit, now check this shit
I got the pack of Rough Riders in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the epilogue by James Todd Smith
I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with the dick, make your kidneys shift
Here we go, here we go, but I'm not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I'm in thirteens, know what I mean
I fuck around and hit you with the Hennessy dick
Mess around and go blind, don't get to see shit
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder, it doesn't matter
Skinny or fat or light-skinned or black, baby, I drop these
Boricua mommies screamin' "Ay papi!"
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
I only smoke blunts if they rolled propa
Look, I gotcha caught up with the drunk flow
Fuck tae kwon do, I tote da fo'-fo'
For niggas gettin' mad cause they bitch chose me
A big black motherfucker with G ya see
All I do is separate the game from the truth
Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Gettin' Physical like Olivia Newt
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia
So gimme a ho, a bankroll and a bag of weed
I'm guaranteed to fuck her till her nose bleed
Even if your new man's a certified mack
You'll get that H-town in ya, you'll want that old thing back

What you wanna do?
I got that old thing back
What you wanna see?
Baby, sing relax and feel
What you be, where you are
You wouldn't start

Bitches screamin' they want that old thing back
Like B I Double G I E
With some new R-U-L-E
Notorious known for bustin' in ya E-Y-E, baby baby!
Bitches know they love to hate me
I come, you come, we come, with back some maybe
How close we came to come the ghetto is crazy
How come you and your sis make similar faces
When I come you be cryin' like I'm killin' ya bitches
Knows when picture in the camera rollin
Cause I only be knowin' how the shit's unfolded
Back shots to the rear, got the mac unloaded
Got a reload, like every so often
You sayin' I got my swagger back
I'm lookin' like bitch, my swagger never left
It's so hard pressed, to be impressed by these new rappers
They actors, and the fact is, you want that old thing back
Shit...


Is my mind playin' tricks, like Scarface and Bushwick
Willie D, havin' nightmares of girls killin' me
She mad because what we had didn't last
I'm glad because her cousin let me hit the ass
Fuck the past let's dwell on the 500 SL, the E and J and ginger ale
The way my pockets swell to the rim with Benjamins
Another hon's in the crib, please send her in
I fuck non-stop, lick my lips a lot, used to lick the clits a lot
But lickin' clits had to stop
Cause y'all don't know how to act when the tongue go down below
Peep the funk flow, really though
I got the cleanest meanest penis, ya never seen this stroke of genius
So take off your Tim boots and your bodysuit
I mean the spandex and hit my man next
Sex gettin' rougher when it come to the nut buster
Pussy crusher, black nasty motherfucker
I don't chase em, I replace em
And if I'm caressin' em, I'm undressin' em
Fuck whatcha heard who's the best in New York
Fulfillin' fantasies without that nigga Mr. Roarke
Or Tattoo I got you wrapped around my dick
And when I'm done I got to split shit
Back shots is my position, I gotcha wishin' for an intermission
Fuck the kissin', lickin' down to your belly button, I ain't frontin'
They don't call me B.I.G. for nuttin, all of a sudden


Biggie Smalls
P. Diddy y'all
Bad Boy for life
Once again going to the top baby
Fuck the bitches, fuck all the stank-ass hoes, all my niggas know
Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique, Gucci Don, you know how we play
Fuckin scandalous-ass bitches; you know how it go, Gooch
I meet a bitch, fuck a bitch
Next thing you know you fuckin the bitch
You just pass it around and shit, pass the shit like a cold and shit
Fuck 'em

Now when I'm fucking off gin I'm invincible
Don't love no ho, that's my principle
'Cause uh, bitches come (and uh) bitches go
That's why I get my nut and I be out the fucking door
(You know) they might be the one to set me up
Want to get they little brother to wet me up
That's why I tote Tecs and stuff to get them off my case
Just in case the little fucker ends up misplaced
I don't give a bitch enough to catch the bus
And when I see the semen I'm leaving
Bitches be scheming, I kid you not
That's why I keep my windows locked and my Glock cocked
One ho said (Big, why you so hard on us?
Why you swear all bitches are so scandalous?)
Thug nigga until the end, tell a friend bitch
'Cause when I like you, then you go and fuck my friend bitch

You know that ain't right
With a friend of mine

You see, I don't sweat these hoes
I keep them in flavors like Timbos and Girbauds
Bitches just like to play the merry-go
(Yeah we know, drop the scenario)
It was me, Dee, the MPV
The blunts and brew thang, knocking some Wu-tang
M-E-T-H-Oh shit, look at them lips and them hips on that bitch
Dee hit the dip, so I can drop my mackadocious shit
Light the blunt clip and recognize a pimp
Needless to speak, the G's obsolete
Don't sleep, banged the skins in a week
On the creep up the avenue
I seen her on the block, who she rapping to?
That's my nigga Dee, damn he got G
Now she fucking him and fucking me, see
You know that ain't right

You know that ain't right
With a friend of mine

Uh now I play her far like a moon play a star
She still sweat me hard cause I'm a rap star
I be cruising up the block, I be passing her
Pimping hard with the female passenger
And the only time I call her to hang
Is when me and Dee blunted up, pissy, scheming on a gang-bang
She should have used her intuition
Then she wouldn't be classified in that position, listen
She's saying I dissed her 'cause I'm fucking her sister
A message to the fellas, that really gets them pissed, uh
But she started that fucking family
She fucked my man Dee, so why she mad at me? (True)
Plus your sister look better than you
Give head better than you, pussy get wetter than you
So break the fuck out like a rash
I'm glad I ain't spend no cash to hit your nasty ass

You know that ain't right
With a friend of mine
The world is filled with pimps and hoes
We'll just talk about those I knows
The world is mine, can't you see?
I'm just trying to be all I can be
Ohhahhoahh, yeah

Now first come the cash, then come the ass
Then come big blunts with big chunks of hash
When I score with a whore, she be game for sure
Pimp so hard a nigga drag his mink on the floor
Won't you admit it? I ain't gotta talk because I live it
Any chick fuckin' with me, believe me, that's a privilege
I won't be satisfied til all my niggas get it
See, you hit it then I hit it, we get it back to split it
And Big be that nigga, we be flying through your hood
And hood rats scoping with their eyes on my goods
See, we date 'em like we hate 'em, see 'em like we don't need 'em
Treat 'em like we beat 'em, and never give up freedom
And we only give our number to selected few
And it's best that you never knew what good head'll do
Turn a freak to a bisexual
And if she's flexible, fuck the nigga next to you

The world is filled with pimps and hoes
We'll just talk about those I knows
The world is mine, can't you see?
I'm just trying to be all I can be
Ohhahhoahh, yeah

Uhh, uhh, uhh
"When the Remy's in the system, ain't no telling
Will I fuck him? Will I diss him?" That's what these hoes yelling
I'm a pimp by blood, not relation
Y'all still chase 'em, I'll replace 'em
Drunk off Dom, silk and gators
Spitting words, make a bird tell they flock see you later
Whether, drunk or high, skunk or Thai
Nigga play against some playa shit, slugs gon' fly
Ain't gon' lie, pimped out her SSI
Nigga don't ask why, just respect it
She bought me the necklace, the bracelet
The Benz-o - she laced it
Crib-o, got it, interior decorated
Now my popularity grew in each state
Now I got 2 in each state
Used to drink brew and eat steak
Now I pop bottles with models, larger steaks on large estates, shit

The world is filled with pimps and hoes
We'll just talk about those I knows
The world is mine, can't you see?
I'm just trying to be all I can be
Ohhahhoahh, yeah

I had a whole lot of bitches in my lifetime
I been blessed with the game, always say the right lines
Had a few prostitutes, and if you knew the truth
They're like pimps, you can't let em do it to you!
She ain't no sucker. I know that bitch, man
She wanna be a Pretty Woman loving a rich man
Now here you come, drop top riding
You ain't no pimp, fake nigga, stop lying
Pussy makes money, stick to the business
Think about the real motherfuckers that lived it
Street life, pimp shit, make the ho respect the game
You bought her diamonds and cars, trick, that's a shame
Say what you want, but I still figure
She left you cause you couldn't be like them real niggas
She was a hustler by nature and you was just faker
Than the average simps, found a badder pimp

Crazy ass man
I never would have bought that bitch all them cars
And all that shit you bought that ho, man
After I heard about what the bitch did nigga, knew the ho!
Man I'm 30 years old, nigga
And that bitch was hoin' when I was in 9th grade and shit
Think about that: she been around then right?
Shit, you just a rest haven for hoes, man
Just the first nigga that came along when the bitch got out the pen
Bitch only fuckin' with you cause you had a good ass job, nigga
Nerd...treat the bitch better than anybody ever treated her
Stupid ass nigga. She ain't nothing but a ho!
Bet you fell in love with her man!
You can't turn a ho into a housewife, fool
Every time you turn your back, that bitch is fuckin' with them gangstas
Eastside, Westside - these are my partners
Do that shit, you know what I'm talkin' bout nigga
I tell you about some real pimps and hoes
Tell you about these pimps and these hoes man, yeah I know a few, shit
Beyotch!
Fam, you know what I'm sayin? (No doubt, man)
The motherfuckin shit just get me so motherfuckin' mad
��Cause, you know, that was my nigga, you know
And like, I had just got the nigga Puff card and shit (yeah)
I knew the shit was 'bout to go down
And my man was like hyping me
'Bout everywhere we go, me and O (pluggin' it)
Me and O be together, and the nigga be like
"Watch, I'm telling you when my man get on, it's gonna be some shit, we ain't gonna have to sell this shit no mo'
I'm telling you" (aight?)
And the nigga just got moked out like that, man (tch)
That shit fucked me up, man
(That shit fucked a whole lot of niggas up, man)
Yo, man, I loved that nigga O too (say word)
That was my motherfuckin' heart

Yeah, dedicating this to my nigga O
We miss you, nigga
Going out to all the young niggas that died in the struggle
Word up, shit is real in the field
You know, sparkin' blunts to all you niggas; word up

Each and every day
Daydreams of how we used to be
See your family
And that baby's lookin' just like you
Why'd you go away?
I've been missin' you lately
Tell me what you're going through, oh yeah

Uhh, uhh
I remember sellin' three bricks of straight flour
Got my man a beat down to the third power
He didn't care, spent the money in a half hour
Got some fishscale, reigned on competition like a shower
Got the coke cooked up, a crackhead Kevin
In '88, when Kane ruled with "Half Steppin'"
A .38, a lot of mouth was our only weapon
We was kings 'til the D's crept in
And now I'm missin' him

Ooh, I'm missin' you (I'm missin' you)
Tell me why the road turns, why it turns
Ooh, I'm missin' you (missin' you)
Nah nah nah nah nah
Oh tell me why why why why

Uhh, we work all week, weekends we play the movies
We rocked flat tops, our girls rocked doobies
Made a killin', even though the D's knew me
Eventually, you know they try to do me
Fuck it! Fed up, my nigga wanted to take it down South
Sick of cops coming, sick of throwing jacks in his mouth
Gave him half my paper, told 'em "Go that route!"
Few months, he got his brain blown out, now I'm stressed
His baby's mother, she trippin', blamin' me
And his older brothers understand the game it be
Kinda topsy turvy; you win some, you lose some
Damn, they lost a brother, they mother lost a son
Fuck, why my nigga couldn't stay in N.Y.?
I'm a thug, but I swear for three days I cried
I, look in the sky and ask God why
Can't look his baby girls in the eye
Damn, I'm missin' him

Ooh, I'm missin' you (I'm missin' you)
Tell me why the road turns, why it turns
(Tell me, tell me why)
Ooh, I'm missin' you (I'm missin' you)
Nah nah nah nah nah
Oh tell me why why
(Tell me, tell me why) why why

There was this girl around the way that made cats drool
Her name's Drew, played fools out they money in pool
People swore we was fuckin', but we was just cool
She used to hang while I slang my joints after school
She'd watch my bomb, help my moms with the groceries
My little sister, the girl was kinda close to me
A little closer than the average girl's supposed to be
Far from a lover, my girl was jealous of her
Then she started messin' with some major players
Handled keys, niggas called them the Bricklayers
A dread kid, had a baby 'fore that bitch Taya
Found out her baby's father cheating
Now Drew, she gotta slay her
One night, across from the corner store
Taya ran around the block with a chrome four-four
Squeezed all six shots in the passenger door
The dude lived �C what my baby had to die for?
I'm missin' her

Ooh, I'm missin' you (I'm missin' you)
Tell me why the road turns, why it turns
(Tell me, tell me why, ooh)
Ooh, I'm missin' you (I'm missin' you)
Nah nah nah nah nah
Oh tell me why why why why (oh God tell me why)
Ooh, I'm missin' you (tell me, tell me why)
Tell me why the road turns, why it turns (ooh ooh)
Ooh, I'm missin' you (missin' you)
Nah nah nah nah nah
Oh tell me why why why why
Ooh, I'm missin' you
Tell me why the road turns, why it turns
Ooh, I'm missin' you

Calico's bumping, I love to bust dough (Jeeesus)

In the middle of it I'mma
Bring niggas more drama then they baby mamas
Nigga wanna battle I'mma bomb ya
One man, but attack like a pack of piranhas
Like terracotta, niggas always ready for the war
But they really don't wanna see a nigga though
We can get em in a minute then we finish with the venom of the rhythm of a nigga with a sick-o-flow
Doing it with Swizz, oh no!
You niggas is in some trouble
Somebody better call po-po, it's gonna be murder when I get to serving them verbally (Yeah!)
Nigga y'all heard of me
Wig splitter, killer nigga, word to me
And I'm classic like Bird and Magic with a tactic to snatch his rep back and stack some platinum
Dumping on them at random
With the bullets I brand them
Fitting to hold the game ransom, running up in your mansion, cash demanding, flashing cannons (Let's go)
Niggas ain't ready for this one cause  (C'mon) I'm on a mission to get even better believe it
I'm heavily heated, it's easy to see me
If you want to see me, let that be the reason (C'mon, B.I.G.!)

The doctor said I need about three weeks of recovery
But the nurses is lovin me
Sayin the best part of the day is my half
Feedin me breakfast, and givin me a sponge bath
(Notorious)
Niggas say I died dead in the streets
Nigga I'm gettin high, gettin head on the beach
Chillin, sittin on about half a million
With all my niggas, all my guns, all my women
Next two years, I should see about a billion
All for the love of drug dealin
Got no love for the other side, fuck them tricks (fuck them)
Any repercussion, Junior M.A.F.I.A. spit clips (that's right)
All the time, Big Poppa kick the war rhymes
Raw flows, and that's how it goes

NOTORIOUS!
C'mon.. we are, we are
NO, NO, NO, NOTORIOUS!
He is.. he is..
NO, NO, NO, NOTORIOUS!

This for my niggas slingin thangs, had my ring encaged
Truck, necklace, igloo ring and things
For the bitches, who see them rims spin and grin
That shit with the V-trim that win
And the enormous fields disperse of rap
On the road to the riches more furs to drag
More niggas to kill, than birds to bag
Hit the jeweler and splurge the tab, uh
Hops, out the truck like, "Trick, what up?"
Call me Sean if you suck, call me gone when I nut (come on)
That's the end of us, get your friend to fuck
Untwist and bend her up, you know the deal (No-no-notorious)
Niggas talkin real greasy on some ballin shit (that's right)
Funny how quick these pricks forget
Actin like I ain't the reason they traded they shit
Switched that 5, copped that 6 (that's right)
It's all good, you know who the clone is
Fuck the Joneses, niggas tryin to keep up with the Combses

NOTORIOUS!

Who that queen bitch, keep her glass filled to the rim?
The Notorious K-I to the M (Notorious)
That's me, on MTV, no doubt
Titty out like what - I don't give a fuck!
Y'all know my attitude, can't stand my cologne
Then stay your ass home, you and your chaperone
(Notorious)
Things done changed, but we continue to reign
As the King and the Queen of hip-hop, me and B.I
Frank White still listen to all the (a)'ttention
I'm by his side, with the chrome fifth, playin my position (Notorious)
Sexy, young thing, from the ghetto
That bitch rockin mics in high heel stilletos
We takin over like Francis
Switchin our styles like the hottest new dances
See, I let y'all live to stack a LITTLE paper
Be glad I pushed my album back, I did y'all hoes a favor!
(Notorious)

She did you a favor, c'mon now, yeah

Ain't that a slut (HELL YEA) she even take it in the butt
Fuck for bout a hour, now she want a golden shower
You didn't know that we be pissin on hoes, bitch (BEOTCH)
Luke and Biggie straight shittin on hoes, bitch (BEOTCH)
Lick your toes, bitch? (BEOTCH) Fuck no, you must be crazy
Squirt in your face and then I'm Swayze (bitch)
Recognize G, straight up, I can't knock ya
After Big Poppa, fuck ALL of Junior M.A.F.I.A
The whole clique, dick sucked, ass licked
Leave your number by the phone, bring yo' ass on home
I roam in Lexuses and Benzes, the fly way
With the flyest bitch gettin head on the highway (ridin)
My way deep throat on Luke's boat
When the moon rises, I'm cumin in her eyes-es (do it)
Just the way players play
Leave it up to me, I get fucked all day (yeah)
Sucked all day, smokin blunts, countin cheese
Fucking bitches til they assholes bleed
What you say ba-by

 All I want is hoes, big booty hoes
 Check it out, here's another one
 All I want is hoes, big booty hoes
"Don't take em to the crib unless they bonin"

Uhh.. uhh..
Biggie bag bitches from barbecues to barmitzvah's
The big don��t fit, use your lips cause.. (use em)
I'm feelin kinda itchy for a quickie
Don't take off your coat, all you got to do is lick me
Me eat you, I beat you, then greet you to the door bitch
Cause I don't love you no more
Which one of these hoes in the lobby wanna slob me?
You know me, I like my dick Brown like Bobby
In the duke shoot, then the bitch get the boot
Unless she lick ass and blow dicks like flutes
I like em cute, round tits and fat asses
Educated, so I can bust off on they glasses
I wanna cum on your tongue and gums, all night
The bitch drink nuts by the pint

Drink it bitch!
All of these hoes do that shit


It's after midnight, it's time to come up
Fuckin with some sluts tryin to bust a nut
I ain't seen this many hoes in a long time
I wanna make em all mine (get down ho)
But it's gettin kinda late, and I cain't wait
Bitch fuck a first date
I pulled out my dick, she called me rude..
.. but then she ate it like food (tramp)
Then she noticed the limp and the whip
Recognize game, you've been pimped by a pimp
Throw all that trick shit, out the window
You come up short tryin to doubt the pimp ho
Too $hort baby, straight from Oakland
Ho money is my fix and I can't be broken
Freak bitches all on my dick
We on some Brooklyn - Oakland, California shit (beotch!)


You knew I was a dog when you met me bitch (BITCH)
Ha ha, fo' sho' (YEAHH)
Tell you anything you wanna hear right about now
To the spot, that's where we goin baby
See we goin to the spot
Do our thang like we always do
You ain't know?
 Yeah, fuck you
 Fuck you too
 Fuck you bitch
 Fuck you motherfucker
 You ain't shit anyway, fuck you
 You ain't shit, you fat motherfucker
 Yeah, whatever whatever, you wasn't sayin' that when you was suckin' my dick
 You wasn't sayin that when you was eatin my pussy, you a nasty motherfucker
 Check it, uhh

What do ya do when yo' bitch is untrue
Do you cut that hooker off and find someone new
I need another bitch (another bitch), in my life

Uh-huh, uhh, uhh
I know he don't treat you like I treat you
Time to explain your game is see-through
Sex is lethal, I ain't gon' lie
Means to get ya back, I ain't gon' try
Like this y'all, my girl sucked anotha nigga dick y'all
Light skinned with the chromed out six y'all
Thought they was creepin, took trips to V-A every third weekend
While you was sleepin', he hit you on the box
Sixty-nine code non-stop
Shoulda left ya then, but my heart said not
You knew too much, the relationship grew too much
You knew about the crack vials, means to be trialed
Where I hid dough under the bathroom tile
Waited for a while, thought you would be the right thing
Then things got frightening
Peep the scene, sorta like Sam Rothstein
Guess you Ginger, huh, go figure
Never thought you could be a gold-digger
Take my dough and spend with the next nigga
Asked my man Jigga, my ace boon coon
Told me cut the bitch off 'fore the shit balloon
Now I'm like Brandy, Sittin' in My Room
Pissy drunk listenin' to Stylistics tunes
Or the O'Jays, thinkin' bout the old days
My nigga's like, fuck that bitch, go play
Baller, when she beep you, don't call her
Guess who I seen, that freak bitch Paula
She was askin' bout ya whereabouts
Here's the digits, I know you can wear that out
Tear that out the frame, ya game so tight
We'll be all fucking tonight, knahmean?!, uhh
(I'm fucking you toniiight..) Feel me?

What do ya do when your man is untrue
Do you cut the sucker off and find someone new
I need another man, in my life

Mmm, uhhh, uhhh!
'Member when you said you would die for me, shit
All of that was just lies to me
Motherfucker shoulda never said bye to me
Now you cry for me, like Jodeci
It's like that y'all, my nigga hit another bitch from the back y'all
Black nasty and mad fat y'all; shoulda seen the ho
Nigga pack your shit, you out the do', ohh
What about the fight in The Mirage
I seen ya Benz parked outside my sister's garage
Said it was your friend Rog, bullshit
I ain't gonna keep puttin' up wit the bullshit
And still I, never sweat these bitches
Q.B. hanged like plaques on the wall with your pictures
Scale them fishes, my love is concrete
Stashin' your heat in the passenger seat of the Nautica Jeep
We've been down for so long
Still a bitch like me tryin' to hold on
Teary eyed, damn a bitch steamin'
Girls steady screamin', "Kim you need to leave him!"
When I testified in court
Couldn't think straight thinkin' bout the bitches I fought over you
Nigga have the shit you bought
And fuck you, movin' is my last resort
You see, nine outta ten niggas ain't shit
One outta five niggas suck a dick
You're mad at me, too bad she ain't as bad as me
Shoulda kept the freak bitch off my canap��
Now you see, ain't no pussy warm as mine
Long as mine, ain't no love as strong as this
When I sucked your dick, it's like smokin' a roach
Uhh, why go from first class to coach

What do ya do when yo' bitch is untrue
Do you cut that hooker off and find someone new
I need another bitch (another bitch), in my life

What do ya do when your man is untrue
Do you cut the sucker off and find someone new
I need another man, in my life

What do ya do when yo' bitch is untrue
Do you cut that hooker off and find someone new
I need another bitch (another bitch), in my life

What do ya do when your man is untrue
Do you cut the sucker off and find someone new
I need another man, in my life
Can I live 'til my last day?
Hittin' honies that be na-sty
Gettin' money in the fast way
And I only care halfway
But I still can't let you pass me

Yo what's beef to you, three niggas with hoodies and bats
That ain't shit compared to one small cat with gats
When we came here we cut off all kind circulation
Breathin', eatin', the whole situation
When we do our shit we do our shit for real
While you take your money for your deal and make your own beats
Compose your own sheets, that's aight but chill
I'ma spend that mil and cop only hot shit
Rock top shit you know how The LOX get
Then you can see me flyin' in the Bentley cockpit
LOX and B-I, hold our grica down for years
Gang not, but we been had our black tears
Niggas under the stairs only understand what we got
Underground, all above must get shot
You couldn't book me Dano, Sheek Luciano put the burners
To all y'all, what nigga bring it I'm callin' y'all

You already know what it's about when I run up in your house
Put the gun up in your mouth and get the money out the couch
Hearin' you out is senseless, perhaps for instance
I give this faggot a french kiss
Black gloves, no prints, dark tints
Word on the street they ain't heard from him since
You know about life after kickin' the kid in
Since me and my mi-dan can flip seven gri-dams
Scri-dam, the flow is forbidd-en
Either you ridin' or you dyin' 'cause we swingin' iron
LOX and Poppa,turning niggas into Jim Hoffa
Who gon' stop us? Your last joint double copper
You gettin' money or your runnin' from the Feds
Ain't nothing over here but 16 with one in the head
And I solemnly swear
That all y'all niggas out there got a problem this year

Can I live 'til my last day?
Hittin' honies that be na-sty
Gettin' money in the fast way
And I only care halfway
But I still can't let you pass me
Can I live 'til my last day?
Hittin' honies that be na-sty
Gettin' money in the fast way
And I only care halfway
But I still can't let you pass me

Before you think of keepin' me down, heatin' me down
The flow like water get deep and you drown
With no soul, many niggas roll with no dough
Even the small gun got a little black hole
Your destiny is something you can never figure out
Niggas is never happy 'til there's blood up in your mouth
There's a lot of killers, but who the hell are you to blame
There's a lot of dead, how the hell you take the pain?
Live with it got money you better give with it
My man had the thug in him did his bid with it
Get married to the game but never have a kid with it
Advice from the wise, slice the pies
Too many schemes devised, when dreams collide
Teams provide, war for the street to absorb
Stashed in the ceiling and you slept on the floor
Only a blind thug'll fall in love with a whore

Uhh, uhh, uhh
Who the fuck wanna squeeze?
My Desert E's make MC's freeze
You wakin' up in cold sweats, they just dreams
You still apologizin'
Analyzin', my size and your size and
Realizin', a fist fight would be asinine
You just pop wines I must pop nines
Genuine steel piece, nozzle in your grill piece
You're shook up, two bricks, every cook up
We can hook up, all I see is the future
Disrespect, I shoot ya
By the way, them bricks, get flipped weekly
Sold by soldiers that mix weed with the leak leak
Die for a dollar, nigga, life ain't sweet
Play for keeps wet shirts with experts on the creep
Our beef is my fianc��, about to marry it
Illegal transactions in Farragut with Arabics
Why not, they fit twelve up in the bedroom
Imagine what they stash is like, make you a classic like
My first LP, beef with me is unhealthy
Fuck around and get an ul-cer, loose your pulse or
Collapsed lung, look how many gats I brung
For them homos, still doin' promos
Break both your legs you're movin' slow-mo
Got shine to glow mo'
Nine hundred and ninety six grams, you need four mo'

Can I live 'til my last day?
Hittin' honies that be na-sty
Gettin' money in the fast way
And I only care halfway
But I still can't let you pass me
Can I live 'til my last day?
Hittin' honies that be na-sty
Gettin' money in the fast way
And I only care halfway
But I still can't let you pass me
Can I live 'til my last day?
Hittin' honies that be na-sty
Gettin' money in the fast way
And I only care halfway
But I still can't let you pass me
Yeahh, worrd
I remember I met this one bitch
Cause you know me I don't see how I'm the nasty motherfucker
I just thought I thought I'da did anything in the world (yeh?)
I meets this one bitch, I comes up in the spot, or whatever
The bitch got the candles lit or whatever, so
She tell me whatever she wanna get her freak on whatever
So I'm like WHASSUP whatchu wanna yaknahmsayin
I'm read to wear it out or whatever (kssss)
The bitch told me she wanted me to shit on her! (*laughing*)
Ya know shit I was like whatchu mean shit?
I mean I might shit on you after I, hit it I won't call you no more
Shit on you like that (*more laughing*)
She talkin about no she want me to cock over her
And shit, on her stomach! (*laughing through his teeth*)
I said bitch what the, what the fuck??
What the fuck I'm sposed to do after I after I shit on her
I'm sposed to hit that after that?
She's just wilding out so after I shits on the bitch right
(*both start laughing*)
Ya know I shit, after I shits on the bitch
The bitch, ya know, washed that shit off or whatever
(Ohhh shit!)

Come on, yeah (repeat 10X)

This goes out to my Brooklyn crew
Representin on the freaky freaky
Fuck em all day fuck em all night
We don't love these hoes

I go on and on and on and
Don't take them to the crib unless they bonin'
Easy, call em on the phone and
Platinum Chanel cologne and
I stay dressed to impress
Spark these bitches interest
Sex is all I expect
If they watch TV in the Lex, they know
They know, quarter past 4
Left the club tipsy, say no mo'
Except how I'm gettin home tomorrow
Caesar drop you off when he see his P.O
Back of my mind I hope she swallow
Man she spilled a drink on my cream Wallows
Reach the gate, hungry just ate
Riffin, she got to be to work by eight
This must mean she ain't tryna wait
Conversate, sex on the first date
I state, "You know what you do to me"
She starts off, "Well I don't usually"
Then I whipped it out, rubber no doubt
Step out, show me what you all about
Fingers in your mouth, open up your blouse
Pull your G-string down South
Threw that back out, in the parking lot
By a Cherokee and a green drop-top
And I don't stop, until I squirt
Jeans, skirt, butt-naked, it all work

You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, nigga you so nasty

I remember we went to Tennessee
Then we came home, mad messages was on my phone
Bitch named Simone
Screamin, she fiendin for the semen
Me bein the man that I am
Took it to her condo pronto
Half Indian, I called her Tonto
Roll the chron'chron' in the dark pronto
Few puffs, eyes got low
And off to the bedroom we go
Sex is drama, head is trauma
Ripped pajamas, I'ma stay 'til tomorrow
Satisfying all my needs twice
With whipped cream, handcuffs and ice
The bitch is nice, word is bond
Can't wait to put my niggas on, what? What?


Ladies, my Mercedes
Hold fo' in the back, two if you're fat
Keep a gat cause cats try to test me
They just fans like DeNiro/Wesley
Let's see, the bitch I'm waitin on
Gardeur jeans look like they painted on
Ask thee, leave it up to me
Lay her on back ever so gently
She like the way the dough fold up, Rolls roll up
Cristal till she throw up, bitch grow up
Hold up, there's DeGenero
Dripped out, iceberg apparel
Intro goes without speaking
Call me Cease cause I keep em, we can go freakin
All weekend, so, roll in
Ain't it good that my Lex seats foldin? Uhh
"Well it's the Funk Docta Spock.."
"Meth-Tical.."
"Biggie.. Biggie.." (mmmhmmmmmm)

Uhh.. uhh.. uhh.. (yo c'mon Big) uhh..
Fuck that, I preach it, my nine reaches
The prestigious, cats that speak this, Willie shit
Flooded pieces, my hand releases, snatches
Smack ya cabbage, half-ass rappers, shouldn't have it
So I grab it, never run, the outcome
Is usually, a beatdown brutally, fuck who you be
Or where you're from, West or East Coast, squeeze toast
Leave most in the blood they layin in, what, what?
The rings and things you sing about, bring 'em out
It's hard to yell when the barrel's in your mouth
It's more than I expected, I thought your jewels was rented
But they wasn't, so run it, cousin
I could chill, the heat doesn't
Ran up in your shell about a dozen
You never see bank like Frank White
Your hand clutchin, your chest-plate contemplate
You 'bout to die, nigga wait, keep yo' hands high

Yo.. yo yo
I don't brown nose out of town hoes
I'm up around fo' with the crowbar to the five point oh
I get bagged, I'm John Doe, suspect
You ass like prime roastin, Calvin Klein clothes
Explode the pyros when Doc guest appear
I'm out there, I bought it with George Jetson here
Your time is near, so get your body dropped off
I stopped trustin niggas since Gotti got caught
It's Bricks, keep your wrist covered, I'm piss colored
By the waist got a gun as dark as Kris brother
I.C.U., my sheisty crew, like ice me too
I break your legs, leave your eyes slightly blue
The Doc was born with a grenade palm
I'm concurrent in your hood like a, teenage mom
Yo Biggie (what? what?) She havin my bay-bayy
If I pull out the A.K., keep your hands high

"This rule is so underrated.." -
"Actin as if it can't happen, you're frontin" -
"Ain't no other kings in this rap thing.." -
"Biggie, a motherfuckin rap phenomenon" -

Uhh, uhh
I got a new mouth to feed, I'm due South with keys
Y'all pick seeds out y'all weed, I watch cowards bleed
Motherfucker please, it's my block with my rocks
Fuck that hip-hop, them one-two's, and you don't stops
Me and my nigga Lance, took Kim and Cease advance
Bought ten bricks, four pounds of weed plants
From Branson, now we lampin, twelve room mansion
Bitches get naked off "Get Money", "Player's Anthem"
Don't forget, "One More Chance" and, my other hits, other shit
Niggas spit be counterfeit, robbery come naturally
In and out like fuckin rapidly, pass the gat to me
Make his chest rest, where his back should be, talkin' blasphemy
Blastin me, your family, rest in coffins often
Frank Wizzah, far from soft or fragilla
Play hard like Reggie Miller, rapper, slash dope dealer
Slash guerilla, slash illest turned iller

Now now
Don't approach me with that rah rah shit, you out of pocket
I take these adolescents back to Spofford
Mentally, my energy, is like a figure eight, on it's side
That's infinity
Too many sick niggas, nickel nines bring the remedy
When you play the field, what's the penalty?
Unnecessary roughness, career endin' injuries for suckers
Stuck on stupid, shoot 'em with a dart like Cupid
Until they got love for my music
Star Wars, I'm Han Solo, with three egos
And three charges, I got to "See-three-P.O.'s"
This is whoop-yo'-ass-day, the sequel
High bar flow-er with no equal
Niggas swingin' swords in the WAR, that's my people
Sho' nuff, before I roll up, this is a hold up
Hands high, reach for the sky
I rep S.I., the unpretty, word to Left Eye
New York Shitty, put they weight on it
And who better for the job than Biggie?
The Notorious, Jeee-zus, "Unbelievable" rhyme that reaches
And touch individual, small frame buck and change
MC, What's-Your-Name, tuck your chain
All about the fortune, fuck the fame, labels still extortin'
Kick me when I'm down, but I'm up again, scorchin'
Hot �� forcin' my way up in the door
To kill the bullshit like a matador
Keep your hands high (what?)
Push
C'mon Shorty stay push, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon push it's almost there
One more time, c'mon
*baby cries*
C'mon push baby, one more time
*baby cries*
Harder harder, push harder
Push, push, c'mon
One more time, here it goes!
I see the head!
Yeah c'mon!
YEAH! YEAHHHH!
You did it baby, yeah!
*Curtis Mayfield - "Super Fly" plays over this*
*Sugarhill Gang - "Rapper's Delight" fades in*

God damnit Voletta, what the fuck are you doin?

I just saw Mr. Johnson, he told me he caught the motherfucking boy shoplifting
(Get your black ass off!)

1970 somethin', 1970 somethin'
1970 somethin', 1970 somethin'
1970 somethin', 1970 somethin'
1970 somthin'

1970 somethin'
Nigga I don't sweat the date, my moms is late
So I had to plan my escape, out the skins
In this world, the fly girl
Tanqueray or Hennessy until I called Earl
Ten months in this gut, what the fuck
I wish moms would hurry up so I could get buck
While, Juvenile rippin' mics and shit
New York, New York ready for the likes of this
Uh, then came the worst date, May, 21st
2:19 is when my mama's water burst
No spouse in the house, so she rolls herself
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help
Umbilical chord's wraped around my neck
I'm seein' my death, and I ain't even took my first step
I made it out, I'm bringin' mad joy
The doctor looked and said "He's gonna be a Bad Boy."

I remmember back in time
(1970 somethin', 1970 somethin')
Before all the homies died
Before all the dollars and nines
I knew that I was goin' somewhere
Let me take you back in time
(19, 70 somethin', 1970 somethin')
Before I even got the rhyme, before I had nickels and
Dimes, I knew that I was goin' somewhere

Would 'Pac be alive, if you let 'Pac drive?
Swear to God, to reverse, that I'll give my Left Eye
With the right I'll visualize the king of Bed-Stuy
Checkin' his daughter, Tyanna into junior high
If I was in Brooklyn and B.I. was still alive
In 2006, it might sound like this
NY, 7-1-8's, 2-1-2's
With Sue's rendezvous, it's like Moulin Rouge
High fashion, uptown Air Force Ones and Vasquez
Puerto Ricans with fat asses
Blazed dutch masters, we dump ashes
On models in S classes for you bastards
Catch a cab to Manhattan, with that Broadway actin'
You hype, that Belly shit'll get you capped and wrapped in plastic
Tell the captain to ask Rog' What's Happenin'?
I hear, nor speak no evil inside the magnum

(1970 somethin', 1970 somethin')
I remmember back in time
Before all the homies died
Before all the dollars and nines
I knew that I was goin' somewhere
(19, 70 somethin', 1970 somethin')
Let me take you back in time

Now I'm thirteen, smokin' blunts makin' cream
On the drug scene, fuck a football team
Riskin' ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen
Hearin' the coach scream ain't my lifetime dream
I mean, I wanna blow up, stack my dough up
So school, I didn't show up, it fucked my flow up
Mom said that I should grow up, and check myself
Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself
Put the drugs on the shelf, nah, couldn't see it
Scarface, king of New York, I wanna be it
Rap was secondary, money was necessary
Until I got incarcerated, kinda scary
C-74, Mark 8 set me straight
Not able to move behind a great steel gate
Time to contemplate, damn, where did I fail?
All the money I stacked, was all the money for bail

I remmember back in time
(1970 somethin', 1970 somethin')
Before all the homies died
Before all the dollars and nines
I knew that I was goin' somewhere
Let me take you back in time
(1970 somethin', 1970 somethin')
Before I even got the rhyme, before I had nickels and
Dimes, I knew that I was goin' somewhere
And I knew that I was going somewhere
Ooooh, oooooh
1970 somethin', 1970 somethin'
To all my Brooklyn (Niggas!)
To all my Uptown (Niggas!)
To all my Bronx (Niggas!)
To all my Queensbridge (Niggas!)
(Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga!)

Back up chump, you know Biggie Smalls rips it quick
And kicks it quick; you know how black niggas get
With the hoods, fatigues with the boots with trees
Smokin weed, flippin ki's, making crazy G's
Hitting buckshots at niggas that open spots
On the avenue--take my loot, and I'm bagging you
Pimping hoes that drive Volvos and Rodeos
Flash the roll, make her wet in her pantyhose
Damn, a nigga's style is unorthodox
Grip the Glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks
Just in case a nigga want to act out
I just black out, and blow they motherfucking back out
That's a real nigga for ya

To all my Brooklyn (Niggas!)
To all my Uptown (Niggas!)
To all my Bronx (Niggas!)
To all my Queensbridge (Niggas!)
(Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga!)

When we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths
Just in case Dread want to riff
He get a free lift to the cemetary, rough very
Not your ordinary: we watch you get buried
That's a real nigga for ya
Get mad, do a quarter, flip the script, and rip your lawyer
Spit at the DA, cause fuck what she say
She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway
Up north, bound first stop for the town
Of Fishkill, where the hand skills are real ill
You'll be a super Hoover doo-doo stain remover
Ha-Hah! Yo G, pass the buddha

To all my Brooklyn (Niggas!)
To all my Uptown (Niggas!)
To all my Bronx (Niggas!)
To all my Queensbridge (Niggas!)
(Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga!)

To all my Brooklyn (Niggas!)
To all my Uptown (Niggas!)
To all my Bronx (Niggas!)
To all my Queensbridge (Niggas!)
(Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga!)

Money, hoes, and clothes
Blunt smoke coming out the nose, is all a nigga knows
Flipping on foes, putting tags on toes
Watching the stash grow, clocking the cashflow
The neighborhood gravedigger
Getting paid so much, all the bitches want to see a nigga
I guess they figure I'm paid, I want to get laid
Or since I got loot, I want to knock boots
I'd rather beat my dick than trick
And if she don't suck, then we don't fuck
I'd rather make a buck, drive a fat-ass truck
Grab the 9, two clips, and run amuck
Yes, flex after two or three Becks
As I wreck shit, what the fuck you expected?
A fly guy? Well fuck it, I'm the high guy
From Bed-Stuy, putting the swelling on your eye
And your nose even; when I choke ya, you stop breathing
And when Jake come, I'm leaving

To all my Brooklyn (Niggas!)
To all my Uptown (Niggas!)
To all my Bronx (Niggas!)
To all my Queensbridge (Niggas!)
(Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga!)
To all my Brooklyn (Niggas!)
To all my Uptown (Niggas!)
To all my Bronx (Niggas!)
To all my Queensbridge (Niggas!)
(Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga!)
To all my Brooklyn (Niggas!)
To all my Uptown (Niggas!)
To all my Bronx (Niggas!)
To all my Queensbridge (Niggas!)
(Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga!)
To all my Brooklyn (Niggas!)
To all my Uptown (Niggas!)
To all my Bronx (Niggas!)
To all my Queensbridge (Niggas!)
(Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga!)

The hotel guest that you have called is unreachable
You may leave a private recorded message at the tone or press zero and a hotel operator will assist you
You may start your message now press zero to return to the attendant

Bad Boy in the house for the '95
Big shout out to my man Mel Smith, my man Don Cee San in the house
What's up Michelle Ray, what's up boo?

Sick of mama screaming that "Get a job, nigga"
Pressed to the limit, got to rob me a nigga
Simple and plain, my man scooped me in a hooptie
Whispered in his ear "This is what we got to do, G"
Got to bang a nigga and bang a nigga good
So I can cop a Benz and drive the fuck out the hood
Cause baby-mama screaming "Your daughter 12 months"
Can't live life slinging rocks and smoking blunts
Hanging wit the niggas don't pay the bills
And being broke at 30 give a nigga the chills
So what we gotta do is creep and see a sweet vic
Yo, you see that shit? (Hell yeah, I seen that shit)
Columbian, Dominican, yeah whatever
Whoever he was, he had it tucked under the leather
Two keys, 20 G's, nigga please
Blew his brains out cause witnesses we don't leave

On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
Hanging with the bitches is the song I sing
Real niggas do real things (x2)

After mad blunts and gin we had the plan made
I bought my wifey a crib, I bought the MAFIA an arcade
Mad games: pool tables and candy
A little extra chicken loot be comin in handy
Check it, got on some '95 shit, sold the 5 bought the 6
Delvecc, copped the lex, we was set
Nino had work all in the projects
Niggas slingin O's he kept the profit, no one could stop it
We was livin it up
All the sexy young bitches ain't stressin givin it up
Same bitches suckin' dick tryin' their best to thrill me
Said the niggas I killed is out to kill me
Soon as she spoke, on that note I saw trenchcoats
One had a mac spittin', all I saw was gun smoke
The other had a shottie, I was shootin' everybody
And I wasn't missing, had to get out this position
Niggas still hitting, feel the hot ones in my back
Licked six shots, smoked the nigga wit the mac
The nigga wit the shottie still busting, cussing
Maricons and putas
All I'm tryin to do is shoot ya, two shots in the ruger
Booh-yeah, blew his ass out
Then I passed out (passed out, passed out)

Bad Boy in the house, for the '95 peace
Real niggas, aight

Yo check it
Call Lil Cease, tell that motherfucker to bring me some motherfucking weed to this hospital
Fuck that, tell Uncle Paulie to go pick up ten thousand from (?) and take about twenty g's from Nino
Tell that motherfucker to get this nigga next door up out of here, that nigga be snoring all night I can't sleep
And call that big butt nurse with the long hair to come suck my dick

The doctor said I need about three weeks of recovery
But the nurses is lovin' me
Saying the best part of the day is my half
Feedin' me breakfast and givin' me a sponge bath
Niggas say I died dead in the streets
Nigga, I'm getting high getting head on the beach
Chillin, sittin on about half a million
With all my niggas, all my guns, all my women
Next two years, I should see about a billion
All for the love of drug dealin
Got no love for the other side, fuck them tricks
Any repurcussion, Junior M.A.F.I.A. spit clips
All the time, Big Poppa kick the raw rhyme
Raw flows, and that's how it goes

On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
Hanging wit the niggas is the song I sing
Real niggas do real things
On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
 Huh?
 Cease-a-Lee'
 Doggystyle.. YEAH!
 B.I.G
 Uhh.. to all the ladies in the house!
 Where they at?
 Uhh, uhh, check it out
 C'mon Big

Another day in the ghetto
One look outside I'm already upset yo
It look about a hundred-and-two
It's a Saturday and Biggie ain't got nothing to do
Uhh, I'm interrupted by a phone ring {*brrrrring*}
Sometimes I wish I never got the motherfucking thing
"Hello hello? Can I speak to Biggie?"
Yo, who dis? "Taisha" Yo call back, I'm busy
Why don't ya hit me on the box a little later
Washed up, got dressed, hits the elevator
Steps out it's the same old scene
Dope fiend, crack fiend, eyewitness news team
I seen a honey with a butt looking butter soft
I know she looks much better with them clothes up off
Sitting all thick, with the ruby red lipstick {*SMACK*}
That's the one I gotta get with

Can I get witcha, can I get witcha

You hitting this nigga, how that sound?"
Huh, first of all you got me mixed up with
Somebody ya done slept with, hold up
That's my Neneh Cherry shit, I got something slicker
Let me just sip up on this liquor
All I wanna do is smoke a little chronic
Slam ya like Onyx, and get ya hooked on
This Biggie Smalls phonics, 102
How to squeeze 22's in them Reebok shoes, HUH?

Can I get witcha (can I get witcha)
Can I get witcha (can I get witcha)

Cause you got a big B-U-T, T

I said walk me upstairs, cause I forgot my Phillies
She said "I don't care, so don't be acting silly"
I knew I had her trapped with my hardcore raps
And it wouldn't take a second before I had her on her back
Pulling back the bra straps, threw on my Silk CD
Cause, "I wanna get freaky with you"
Lose control on the skins is all I can picture, now I'm about to hit you

Can I get witcha (can I get witcha)
Can I get witcha (can I get witcha)
"Why you wanna get with me?"
Cause you got a big B-U-T, T

To all my hoes, respect due
Tamika sorry I left you

Pull up my pants and diss you
And hit the door you came through
It's Cease-a-Lee, a.k.a. Mista Nasty
Germany style, these hoes they blast me
One of the chickenhead with sex appeal pass me
That's her hands, ankles, feet they ashy
I like the flashy type, who pass with dykes
With long hair, and they ass be right
I get up on that ass, see what that be like
I fuck a bitch good, if she ask me right, huh
Previously on Ready to Die

... me and her sister had something going on
I reach my peak, I can't speak
(A-yo, you listening to me motherfucker?)
Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak

I'm sick of niggas lying, I'm sick of bitches hawkin'
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talking
*BANG*
(Ayo Big, ayo Big!)

Damn... we was s'pose to rule the world baby
We was unstoppable!

My Fulton Street niggas (hardcore for ninety-six)
Dangerous MC's
Uhh (Check it out) uhh
Diamonds on my neck, chrome drop-top
Chillin' on the scene, smokin' pounds of green
Oooh-wee, you see, the ugliest
Money-hungriest, Brooklyn Loch Ness
Nine millimeter cock test, wan fi' test?
And the winner is...

Y'all niggas know the rules
I blast on niggas so --

-- my fist never bruise
Land-still-cruise, Frank White paid his dues
Ask who's the raw, bet they say Poppa very
Look forward to me like commissary
All of a sudden, now every-body Big Willie
Done did it, come widdit, get yo' head splitted
Or get your neck slitted, admit it, you overdid it
Your shit it, just ain't got that LOUD
Gold tooth shine like TaaDow!
Biggie Smalls the illest and how, phrase raise your eyebrow
By now you figure, he talkin' bout that nigga
But your weak-ass assumptions, lead led to dumpin'
IV to pump-in, you're feeling something
Catch my drift, or catch my four-fifth lift
At least six inches, above project fences
Turn meat to minces, jumps turn to flinches
When I rain I drenches, cleared your park benches (HAH)
Missed you by pinches (HOO) your talk is senseless (RRUFF)
Actor needs chiropractor (HAH, HOO) for cracked jaw
Yes, I rocked your chatterbox (Hah)
Dangerous you're not I gets down (HOO)
Twist your body {*singing*} round and round, upside down

C'mon, yo, throw your hands, c'mon

Bump your fists, c'mon
Thugs tote yo' shit

Bitch lick yo' lips, c'mon
Dangerous MC's
My nigga this be the shit, c'mon
Dangerous MC's
My nigga this be the shit, c'mon

Uh-huh, make money hand over fist
The bo-vines roam where chickenhearts don't exist
Settin' up shop, it's hands on in the hustle
Fakes don't kill nuttin' but time and don't tussle
The process of elimination, fresh rotation
Come and go and they death be starvation
In the heat of battle it's no rest for the weary
Snooze and you lose is the theory
The theory of a patient man, is wild beyond belief
Be afraid, you don't want beef with us chief
Your talk is cheap and the supply meets demand
Everything you can imagine is real man
And revenge be the dish I serve to cats cold
Stay up on about ten folds, you know how it goes
You know the streets and it's real as shit, c'mon
Niggas grab your dicks, c'mon
Bitches rub your tits, c'mon

C'mon, yo, throw your hands, c'mon
Bitch grab your tits, c'mon
Let me know you in the spot
Bump your fists, c'mon

You come up in my room look bitch you takin' it off
Follow me, I slip em slide em rip em ride em provide em
With that West coast G shit, L.B.C. shit
We dips to this, make chips to this
And buy brand new whips and shit, uh-huh (Beyotch)
I bet you didn't know that yo' bitch was suckin' dick (say what?)
Who you think she fuckin' with? (What?) Look here
My, Eastside lifestyle is way foul, move the crowd
Point a pistol at you bitch niggas, BLA-DOW
...How you like me now? (What, what, what?)
You got stuck and fucked, Doggystyle
100 spokes Day-tonas, bendin' the corner
All up in Crooklyn, bad bitches are lookin'

Can yo' pussy be chaka, don't let me speak in pat-ois
And kick you in your face like we playin' a game of soc-cer

And fuck your crew because all of y'all niggas full of ca-ca

Akon and B.I.G. yea

Niggas talkin' it but ain't livin' it
Cristal pops I'm sippin' it, mob hats and lizard shit
'Gator trunks bitch, rollin' blunts with the williest of the willy
Heckler Koch, M-1's and nine millies
Stories like a motherfucker
Model bitches wondering if I'm a fuck with her
She know I treats my bitches like Ivana
Dolce and Gabana drippin'
Big Poppa never slippin'
H-class diamonds shinin'
Dinner with the wifey winin', dinin'
Smoking cigars in Bogota
With Colombian niggas named Panama
And Englique and shit
Games we play life endin'
Bitches bending over with ease
For a pair of Moschino jeans
And Donna Karan tank tops I got your bank stopped
Singles on top
Benjamins
Under the rest of 'em
Advancin'
From duplex to mansion
Stashing keys hidin' G's overseas
VCR's in my V's
Game elevates, money I make
Gets your stocks and real estates, bitch
Jet skiing in the Caribbean, white sands
Discussing plans with my mans
Dark blue land, smoke tint chrome rims and system
That leaves your rear views tremblin'
What you gonna do when poppa catch an attitude?
Drop to your knees and show gratitude
Kiss my rings it's a Frank White thing I stay potent
Bitch is devoted, take my dick and deep throat it

Eternal sunshine in this elevated world of mine
Looking for this hour glass of time
Trying to find my purpose on this grand design
Is there anybody out there living?
4-5-6 is on the streets, they shootin
Is there any money out there for me?
You just listen to this husler's story

Picture me, a product of the zone three
Scared lost, don't know what I'm suppose to be
Shit cost, money never came to me
When shit short, I suffered unshamelessly
The lord humble niggas 'specially if they act like
They too big for they draw when they stacks right
Think I'm bullshittin'? A bunch of niggas back like
Right back hungry, stacks gone, they forgot Christ
I know a nigga sold his soul for a nickel rock
I know some hoes for the dro you can hit the cock
I know a nigga workin' 9-5
Been on 15 years, ain't got a car to drive
I know some nigga wanna act hard, flicks pitch
Fake jack boys, can't rob, get killed
Got kin folk backyard big whips
Escart that lift my homeboy this year


Akon

While B.I.G. sittin up with Englique
I'm on the coastline politickin' wit Jose
We got the birds flyin' in the coupe all day
Tryin' to find a new way to smugglin' pure yay'
We bout our business, ain't know small time fees
If you ain't growin the 'caine then we ain't gon' meet
See I'm the one when things get deep
And my Africans will put yo' main man to sleep, now
And Mexico far from the block
Tryin' to figure out how many Glocks to a box, now
Sellin' arms as well as rocks in my socks
If you could show me the money, here's the ki's to the lock, now
Hey, you know the streets is my territory
Ain't scared of nothin, let you fear it for me
Hey, whether win, lose or draw
Believe that death is waitin for all


Face Mob in the buildin (Uh huh)
Niggas is quick to chop rocks and hot hands
Make a break for it, get away for it, that was the plan (but)
So the whole time, I been plottin' on his man
Caught him slippin' and sleepin', I hit his ass wit the can, and
Here's somethin' that you can't understand
How can one be so cold and snatch a nigga's soul? (Damn)
I'm on some get back shit, there comes a time
In every man's mind when it's deeper than dollar signs
I been on the grind, got homies doi'n time
Behind niggas actin like bitches and bitches droppin' dimes
I'm duckin' indictments, pussy just wet and wise
Niggas just ain't tellin', no, they know we let it slide
But nah, we gotta ride and him, he gotta die
So if you catch up to his ass before I catch him, give him mine
The rats one thing a real nigga here despise
I'm a five K one killa, I set his ass on fire
Queen Bee, and Notorious B.I.G. nigga
The best that ever lived, the best that ever did it
The best that ever lived it
Cocksuckers, What's his name, huh?
That's how we do it ya'll
To all my niggas in the house
Bad Boy, Who we die for
All day, everyday nigga

For the love of BIG, we bang out
Since my man died, we don't hang out
We blow brains out, we tear the club up pullin things out
Mafia World, all my niggas max out
We Bad Boys, why ya'll niggas cracked out
Coward niggas, most are burried down south
Far from gangstas, really hush puppies
Niggas bearly speak when we discuss money
Niggas stay yappin when there's always somethin funny
The realest niggas never took nuthin from me
Rock ice, stay jig, fuck with niggas that got drunk, and hate kids
Got niggas on state bids, that hate movies like Rosewood and Matrix
A yo, Biggie taught me well, Biggie told me how to flip bricks like cartwheel
Chorus: Lil' Cease & Notorious B.I.G

To all my thugs who puffed him
To all my girls who hugged him
You love him, yell his name..
I'd rather die on my feet, than live on my knees
Nigga please, I cock and squeeze for..
Mafia

Representin Bucktown
Mack 11's cocked back, niggas better duck down
Face down, you know the routine, the cream
Earings, you know the drama Biggie bring

For BIG I learn to grip aim and cock it
Once I got it, I lock it
Banger, big city boy with deep pockets
See me speak, that paper better be the topic
I like my ice frozen like the Antartic
I'm quick to finish it, your good to start it
And with the flashy colors on, you just a target, Waitin for a hard hit
I like marine blue, marine green, roll with a mean team
Meshed out, fresh out, and stay greams
We big boys, we do big things, born in this county of kings
I ain't got shit, I spread things, take things
Fuck whenever my mood swings, from the summer for the winter to the spring
My nigga ill's holdin it down for the beam
Like BIG said, we do the real things, we still bubble and steal chains
Still tustle, still struggle, we feel pain
Still ride, still die for BIG's name
(chorus)

For BIG I grip the Sig, put six in your wig
Not cause of what he said, cause of what he did
When I hear that pop quiz, that's the way I was raised and thats the way it is for..
We roll like the Panthers, show our guns on camera
Do jokes with police scanners, niggas mediocre, full of dirt like hampers
I roll with a bunch of niggas that wear bandanas and rep...
We kept it thurough, from the heart ripped the barrel
B.K. style, see BIG howl, now
Lets see who, wanna go against Mafia world
Niggas nuthin but squirels, they know we rep...
Niggas tryin to get a nut, hit in the head or below the gut
Wood style roll'em up, get plucked, nigga what
Go back to spend a ton, and know cats wit gold tooths
Know my gat and bust for my nigga...
(chorus)

Now when I cock back and squeeze, my Desert E'z
Make you drop to your knees, barely able to breathe
My bullets move in threes, one for Brook-lyn
One for Mafia so take that, Uh, and this one's for...
You know Frank kept me iced out
Mink dragon, seven figures in my bank account
All that material shit, ya'll still tryin to get it
Uh, you fuckin pricks, get off his dick tryin to be like...
All ya'll lame ass niggas keep my man name out your mouth
Or get this shit right, check it, it's the B-I, double G-I, E
Ya'll niggas can't see Poppa, nor the Big Moma
Who you love... for the Y2G, the two ten
We got it sewn, we don't need ya'll help, we hold our own
Cause this goes out to cats not tryin to give it up
BIG lives in us, shout him out...
(chorus)
(chorus into fade)



You know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
Happiness, living on tha streets is a delusion
Even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
Shot up or shot down with tha bullet that he bought
Nine millimeter kickin' thinking about what tha streets do
to me
Cause they never talk peace in tha black community
All we know is violence, do tha job in silence
Walk tha city streets like a rat pack of tyrants
Too many brothers daily heading for tha big penn
Niggas commin' out worse offthan when they went in
Over tha years I done alot of growin' up
Getten drunk thrown' up
Cuffed up
Then I said I had enough
There must be another route, way out
To money and fame, I changed my name
And played a different game
Tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle
If one more cop harrasses me I just might go psycho
And when I gettem
I'll hittem with tha bum rush
Only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed
Yo, if your smart you'll really let me go 'G'
But keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch tha uzi
They got me trapped....



(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
They got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped
(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)

They got me trapped
Can barely walk tha city streets
Without a cop harrassing me, searching me
Then asking my identity
Hands up, throw me up against tha wall
Didn't do a thing at all
I'm tellen you one day these suckers gotta fall
Cuffed up throw me on tha concrete
Coppers try to kill me
But they didn't know this was tha wrong street
Bang bang, down another casualty
But it's a cop who's shot there's brutality
Who do you blame?
It's a shame because tha mans slain
He got caught in tha chains of his own game
How can I feel guilty after all tha things they did to me
Sweated me, hunted me
Trapped in my own community
One day i'm gonna bust
Blow up on this society
Why did ya lie to me ?
I couldn't find a trace of equality
Work me like a slave while they laid back
Homie don't play that
It's time I lett'em suffer tha payback
I'm tryin to avoid physical contact
I can't hold back, it's time to attack jack
They got me trapped



(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
You know they got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped
(uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
You know they got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)

Now i'm trapped and want to find a getaway
All I need is a 'G' and somewhere safe to stay
Can't use tha phone
Cause i'm sure someone is tappin in
Did it before
Ain't scared to use my gat again
I look back at hindsite the fight was irrelevant
But now he's tha devils friend
Too late to be tellin' him
He shot first and i'll be damned if I run away
Homie is done away I should of put my gun away
I wasn't thinkin' all I heard was tha ridicule
Girlies was laughin', Tup sayin "Damn homies is dissin you"
I fired my weapon
Started steppin' in tha hurricane
I got shot so I dropped
Feelin' a burst of pain
Got to my feet
Couldn't see nothin' but bloody blood
Now i'm a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer
Ran through an alley
Still lookin' for my getaway
Coppers said Freeze, or you'll be dead today
Trapped in a corner
Dark and I couldn't see tha light
Thoughts in my mind was tha nine and a better life
What do I do ?
Live my life in a prison cell
I'd rather die than be trapped in a living hell
They got me trapped



(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
They got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped
(uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
You know they got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped





All you wanted to be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted to be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted to be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted to be, a soulja, like me



They cuttin off welfare..
They think crime is risin now
You got whites killin blacks,
cops killin blacks, and blacks killin blacks
Shit just gon' get worse
They just gon' become souljas
Straight souljas

All you wanted to be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted to be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted to be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted to be, a soulja, like me


Crack done took a part of my family tree
My mom is on the shit, my daddy's splittin, mom is steady blamin me
Is it my fault, just cause I'm a young black male?
Cops sweat me as if my destiny is makin crack sales
Only fifteen and got problems
Cops on my tail, so I bail til I dodge 'em
They finally pull me over and I laugh
"Remember Rodney King?" and I blast on his punk ass
Now I got a murder case..
.. you speak of heaven punk? I never heard of the place
Wanted to come up fast, got a Uz and a black mask
Duckin fuckin 'Task', now who's the jack-ass?
Keep my shit cocked, cause the cops got a glock too
What the fuck would you do - drop them or let 'em drop you?
I chose droppin the cop
I got me a glock, and a glock for the niggaz on my block
Momma tried to stab me, I moved out
Sold a pound a weed, made G's, bought a new house
I'm only seventeen, I'm the new kid
Got me a crew, bought 'em jewels, and a Uz'-thick
But all good things don't last
'Task' came fast, and busted my black ass
Coolin in the pen, where the good's kept
Now my little brother wants to follow in my footsteps
A soulja

Buck, buck - niggaz get fucked, don't step to this
Quiet as kept I'm blessed on a quest with a death wish
Tell 'em to come and test, and arrest, nigga it's hectic
Here's the anorexic, I'm makin it to an exit
Walkin through the streets on the black tip
Packed with several gats, cause I'm on some "pay 'em back" shit
Niggaz don't wanna try me, brother you'll get shot down
Now I'm king of the block, since my bigger brother's locked down
I'm hot now, so many punk police have got shot down
Other coppers see me on the block, and they jock now
That's what I call a kingpin
Send my brother what he needs and some weed up to Sing-Sing
Tellin him just be ready set
Pack ya shit up quick; and when I hit, be prepared to jet
Niggaz from the block on the boat now
Every single one got a gun, that'll smoke - pow!
These punks about to get hit by the best
I'm wearin double vest.. so aim at my fuckin chest
I'll be makin straight dome calls
Touch the button on the wall, you'll be pickin up your own balls
I can still hear my mother shout..
"Hit the pig nigga, break your bigger brother out"
I got a message for the warden
I'm comin for ya ass, as fast as Flash Gorden
We get surrounded in the mess hall, yes y'all
A crazy motherfucker makin death calls
Just bring me my brother and we leavin
For every minute you stall, one of y'all bleedin..
They brought my brother in a jiffy
I took a cop, just in case things got tricky
And just as we was walkin out (BANG!)
I caught a bullet in the head, the screams never left my mouth
My brother caught a bullet too
I think he gon' pull through, he deserve to
The fast life ain't everything they told ya
Never get much older, following the tracks of a soulja



I don't give a fuck
They done push me to the limit the more I live
I might blow up any minute, did it again
Now I'm in the back of the paddy wagon
While this cops bragging about the nigga he's jackin
I see no justice
All I see is niggas dying fast
The sound of a gun blast
Then watch the hurst past
Just another day in the life 'G'
Gotta step lightly cuz cops tried to snippe me
The catch, they don't wanna stop at the brother man
But then they'll have an accident and pick up another man
I went to the bank to cash my cheque
I get more respect from the mutha-fuckin' dope man
The Grammy's and the American music shows pimp us like hoes
They got dough but they hate us though
You better keep your mind on the real shit
And fuck trying to get with these crooked ass hypocrites
They way they see it, we was meant to be keep down
Just can't understand why we getting respect now
Mama told me they're be days like this
But I'm pissed cause it stays like this
And now they trying to send me off to Kuwait
Gimme a break
How much shit can a nigga take
I ain't goin' nowhere no how
What you wanna throw down
Better bring your guns pal
Cuz this is the day we make 'em pay
Fuck bailin' hate I bail and spray with my A-K
And even if they shoot me down
There'll be another nigga bigger
from the mutha-fuckin' underground
So step but you better step quick
Cause the clocks goin' tick and I'm sick of the bullshit
You're watching the makings of a physco-path
The truth didn't last
Before the wrath and aftermath
Who's that behind the trigger?
Who'd do yah figure!?
A mutha-fuckin night nigga
Ready to buck and rip shit up
I had enough and I don't give a fuck

Niggas!, isn't just the blacks
also a gang of mutha-fuckas dressed in blue slacks
They say niggas hang in packs and their attitude is shitty
Tell me, who's the biggest gang of niggas in the city
They say niggas like to do niggas,
Throw me in the cuffs with just two niggas
A street walkin' nigga and a beat walkin' nigga with a badge
I had to shoot yah and the pass for the blast take his cash
And bash his head in dump him at the dead in
And that's just his luck
Cause a nigga like me
don't really give a fuck

Walked in the store what's everybody staring at
They act like they never seen a mutha fucker wearing black
Following a nigga and shit
Ain't this a bitch
All I wanted was some chips
I wanna take my business else where
But where?
Cause who in the hell cares
About a black man with a black need
They wanna jack me like some kind of crack fiend
I wonder if knows that my income is more than
His pension, salary and then some
Your daughter is my number one fan
And your trife ass wife wants a life with a black man
So who's the mac in fact who's the black jack
Sit back and get fat off the fat cat
while he thinks that he's getting over
I bust a move as smooth as casanova
And count another quick meal
I'm getting paid for my traid but its still real
And if you look between the lines you'll find a rhyme
AS strong as a fuckin' nine
Mail stacked up niggas wanna act up
Let's put the gats up and throw your backs up
But the cops getting dropped by the gun shot
Usta come but he's done, now we run the block
To my brothers stay strong keep yah heads up
They know we fed up
But we they just don't give a fuck

They just don't give a fuck

I gotta give my fuck offs

Fuck you to the San FranCisco police department
Fuck you to the Marin County Sheriff department
Fuck you to the F.B.I
Fuck you to the C.I.A
Fuck you to the B-u-s-h
Fuck you to the AmeriKKKa
Fuck you to all you redneck prejudice mutha fuckas
And fuck yah
Fuck Y'all
Punk gay sensitive little dick bastards
2paclypse mutha fuckin' know
Y'all can kiss my ass and suck my dick
And my uncle Tommy's balls
Fuck Y'all
Punks, punks, punks, punks, punks



They claim that I'm violent, just cause I refuse to be silent
These hypocrites are havin fits, cause I'm not buyin it
Defyin it, envious because I will rebel against
any oppressor, and this is known as self defense
I show no mercy, they claim that I'm the lunatic
But when the shit gets thick, I'm the one you go and get
Don't look confused, the truth is so plain to see
Cause I'm the nigga that you sell-outs are ashamed to be
In every Jeep and every car, brothers stomp this
I'm Never Ignorant, Getting Goals Accomplished
The underground railroad on an uprise
This time the truth's gettin told, heard enough lies
I told em fight back, attack on society
If this is violence, then violent's what I gotta be
If you investigate you'll find out where it's comin from
Look through our history, America's the violent one
Unlock my brain, break the chains of your misery
This time the payback for evil shit you did to me
They call me militant, racist cause I will resist
You wanna censor somethin, motherfucker censor this!
My words are weapons, and I'm steppin to the silent
Wakin up the masses, but you, claim that I'm violent



The cops can't stand me, but they can't touch me
Call me a dope man, cause I rock dope beats
Jacked by the police, didn't have my ID
I said, "Excuse me, why you tryin to rob me?"
He had tha nerve to, say that I had a curfew
(Do you know what time it is?
Get out the fucking car, or I'll hurt you!)
"Get out the car... or I'lI hurt you"
So here I go, I better make my mind up
Pick my nine up, or hit the line-up
I chose B, stepped into the streets
The first cop grabbed me, the other ripped my seat
They grabbed my homie and they threw him to the concrete
(Ay man.. aiyyo.. ay man just c'mon ?)
("What you doin man?") They tried to frame me
They tried to say I had some dope in the back seat
But I'm a rap fiend, not a crack fiend
My homie panicked ("I'm out") he tried to run
(Freeze nigga!) I heard a bullet fire from the cop's gun
My homie dropped so, I hit the cop
I kept swingin, yo, I couldn't stop
Before I knew it, I was beatin the cop senseless
The other cop dropped his gun, he was defenseless
(? Arrrrggggh, fuck you! Ungggh!)
Now I'm against this cop who was racist
Given him a taste, of tradin places
And all this, cause the peckerwood was tryin this
frame up, but I came up
Now they claimin that I'm violent

As I was beatin on a cop, I heard a gun click (uh-ohh)
Then the gun shot, but I wasn't hit
I turned around it was my homie with the gun in hand
He shot the cop (damn!) now he's a dead man
I said, come on, it's time for us to get away
(Let's go, we gotta get the fuck outta here)
They called for backup, and they'll be on their way
Jumped in the car, and tried to get away quick
The car wouldn't start (damn!) we in deep shit
So we jumped out (C'mon let's take the cop's car)
We drove a little ways thinkin that we got far
But I looked up, and all I saw was blue lights
If I die tonight, I'm dying in a gunfight
I grabed the AK, my homie took the 12 gauge
Load em up quick, it's time for us to spray
We'll shoot em up with they own fuckin weapons
And when we through sprayin (audi) then we steppin
This is a lesson, to the rednecks and crooked cops
You fuck with real niggaz, get ya fuckin ass dropped
So here we go, the police against us
Dark as dusk, waitin for the guns to bust (What's next man?)
What's next, I don't know and I don't care
One things fo' sho', tommorrow I won't be here
But if I go, I'm takin all these punks with me
Pass me a clip G, now come and get me
You wanna sweat me, never get me to be silent
Givin them a reason, (a reason) to claim that I'm violent...



Killing us one by one
In one way or another
American will find a way to eliminate the problem
One by one
The problem is
the troubles in the black youth of the ghettos
And one by one
we are being wiped off the face of this earth
At an extremly alarming rate
And even more alarming is the fact
that we are not fighting back
Brothers, sistas, niggas
When I say niggas it is not the nigga we are grown to fear
It is not the nigga we say as if it has no meaning
But to me
It means Never Ignorant Getting Goals Acomplishes, nigga
Niggas what are we going to do
Walk blind into a line or fight
Fight and die if we must like niggas

This is for the masses the lower classes
The ones you left out, jobs were givin', better livin'
But we were kept out
Made to feel inferior, but we're the superior
Break the chains in out brains that made us fear yah
Pledge a legiance to a flag that neglects us
Honour a man that who refuses to respect us
Emmancipation, proclamation, Please!
Nigga just said that to save the nation
These are lies that we all accepted
Say no to drugs but the governments' keep it
Running through our community, killing the unity
The war on drugs is a war on you and me
And yet they say this is the Home of The Free
But if you ask me its all about hyprocracy
The constitution, Yo, it don't apply to me
Lady Liberty still the bitch lied to me
Steady strong nobody's gonna like what I pumpin'
But its wrong to keeping someone from learning something
So get up, its time to start nation building
I'm fed up, we gotta start teaching childern
That they can be all that they wanna to be
There's much more to life than just poverty

This is defaintly ahhh words of wisdom
AMERIKA, AMERIKA, AMERIKKKA
I charge you with the crime of rape, murder, and assault
For suppressing and punishing my people
I charge you with robery for robbing me of my history
I charge you with false imprisonment for keeping me
Trapped in the projects
And the jury finds you guilty on all accounts
And you are to serve the consequences of your evil schemes
Prosecutor do you have any more evidience


They shine upon the strength of an nation
Conquer the enemy on with education
Protect thy self, reach with what you wanna do
Know thy self, teach what we been through
On with the knowledge of the place, then
No one will ever oppress this race again
No Malcolm X in my history text
Why is that?
Cause he tried to educate and liberate all blacks
Why is Martin Luther King in my book each week?
He told blacks, if they get smacked, turn the other cheek
I don't get it, so many questions went through my mind
I get sweated, They act as if asking questions is a crime
But forget it, one day I'm gonna prove them wrong
Now every brother had to smother on the welfare line
The american dream, though it seems it attainable
They're pulling your sleave, don't believe
Cause it will strangle yah
Pulling the life of your brain, I can't explain
Beg as you can obtain from which you came
Swear that your mother is living in equality
Forgeting your brother that's living her apology
Thought they had us beat when they took our kids
But the battle ain't over till the black man sings
Words of Wisdom
But the battle ain't over till the black man sings
Words of Wisdom

NIGHTMARE thats what I am
America's nightmare
I am what you made me
The hate and evil that you gave me
I shine of a reminder of what you have done to my people
for Four hundred plus years
You should be scared
You should be running
You should be trying to silence me
ha ha
But you can not escape fate
Well it is my turn to come

More than an adversary I'm very quick
I'm ready to hit 'em with this gift
I'm equipped to kick
Grab you coat and you hat, cause I'm prepared to clamp
Scared the [???], and caught them mutha-fuckas damp
Oh shit, 2pacalypse is back and strapped
Attacking the pacs, I'm kicking the facts for stacks to rap
And those that max, relax and let the blacks get jacks
I'm getting taxed, my pacs is packed with angry blacks
I'm ready to go
I'm ripping the shows, hitting the dough
Getting the hoes [???]
Pumping the flow, gangster ho
cause the nose knows
Check the pose, froze, when you see me close
Punks you gonna roast, host, in a cloud of smoke
Broke, choked on a rope, and then smoked
wrote, crimes that'll bring me bank notes
nope, I ain't the type of fella that you use though
Kkkkkkicking the funky flava
Pumping [???] producers
Run for cover when you hear the bass drop
One verse is all it takes

A smokin ass nigga robbed me blind
I got a tech nine now his smokin ass is mine
I guess I felt sorry for the bastard, he was broke
I didn't know he smoked so I didn't watch him close
He caught me on the sneak tip, now the punk's in deep shit
Catch him on the streets, I'ma bring him to his feet, quick
Pass the clip, I think I see him comin now
Fuck the bullshit, posse deep and let's run him down
Gots to be the first one to hit ya when we meet
Comin quickly up the streets, is the punk ass police
The first one jumped out and said, "Freeze!"
I popped him in his knees and shot him, punk.. please..
Cause cops should mind they business, when we rush
Now you're pleadin like a bitch, cause you don't know how to.. hush..
Now back to the smoker that robbed me
I tell you like Latifah, motherfucker give me.. body..
One to the chest, another to his fuckin dome
Now the shit can rest, yo tell him to leave me the fuck alone
Two very bloody bodies on the streets
A nosey ass cop and a nigga that robbed from me
Run from your backup punk, how you figure?
My finger's on the trigger for you crooked ass niggaz


Now listen to the mack of the crooked nigga trade
With the fine criminal mind, cold rips like a blade
It's already quick steppin to the niggaz with the props
and any motherfucker with the flim-flam drops to the knot
Ten o'clock, is a motherfuckin gank move
Stretch is Uptown, clockin weight the shit is real smooth
A nigga's tryin to play me like he know me but he don't
Sittin on ten keys, I'ma get him, think I won't?
My nigga 2Pac, got the fuckin Glock cocked, and he's ready
When the kid, didn't even bring the weight bag, instead he
welcomed us, into his apartment
Oh this even better, two to the head, he's dead a clean get-a-WAY!
Niggaz got PAID!
And yet another sleepin ass nigga got slayed, word up
By a crooked motherfucker named Stretch
And the T-U-P-A-C, the police can't catch..


Now I could be a crooked nigga too
When I'm rollin with my crew, watch what crooked niggaz, do!
I got a nine millimeter Glock pistol
I'm ready to get witcha at the drop, of a whistle
So make your move, and act like you wanna flip
I fire thirteen shots, and pop another clip
I bring luck, my Glock's like a fuckin mop
The more I shot, the more motherfuckers dropped
And even cops got shot when they rolled up
Best to bring a knot, or get popped, I'm a soldier
I ain't the type to fetch ya, ask Stretch, he's my witness
Smoke til I'm blitzed, fuck a motherfuckin piss test
I'm trigger happy, try to 'tack me and I'll drop you quick
Long as I got a clip I got some shit to hit em with
The nigga killer I get iller when the shit gets thick
My brain flips, I start thinkin like a lunatic
I rip shit, came equipped with a bigger crew
I thought these niggaz knew, I'm a crooked nigga too



Crooked ass niggaz come in all shapes and sizes
They wear disguises, backstabbin's what they specialize in
They'll try to getcha, they'll sweatcha to get in the picture
And then they hitcha, son of a bitch! Now he's richer
Crooked ass nigga..


Criminal behaviour
Criminal, criminal, crim
Crim-criminal behaviour
Criminal beha.. crima-crima-crima
Crim-crim, criminal behaviour
Criminal behaviour..



Ever since you was a pee-wee, down by my knee with a wee-wee
We been coochie-coo all through school, you and me G
Back in the days we played practical jokes on
everybody smoked with they locs and the yolks on
All through high school, girls by the dozens
Sayin we cousins, knowin that we wasn't
But like the old saying goes
Times goes on, and everybody grows
Grew apart, had to part, went our own ways
You chose the dope gaaaane, my microphone pays
In many ways we were paid in the old days
So far away from the crazies with AK's
And though I been around clowning with the Underground
I'm still down with my homies from the hometown
And if you need, need anything at all
I drop it all for y'all, if my homies call



It's a shame, you chose the dope game
Now you slang cane on the streets with no name
It was plain that your aim was mo' cane
You got game now you run with no shame
I chose rappin tracks to make stacks
In fact I travel the map with raps that spray cats
But now I don't wanna down my homie
No matter how low you go you're not lowly
And I, hear that you made a few enemies
But when you need a friend you can depend on me, call
If you need my assistance there'll be no resistance
I'll be there in an instant
Who am I to judge another brother, only on his cover
I'd be no different than the other
H-to-the-O-to-the-M-to-the-I-to-the-E
I'm down to the E-N-D
Cause it's a fall in no time at all
I'm down for y'all, when my homies call
Word, if my homies call



Well it's ninety-one and I'm livin kinda swell now
But I hear that you're going through some hell pal
But life makin records ain't easy
It ain't what I expected it's hectic it's sleazy
But I guess that the streets is harder
Trying to survive in the life of a young godfather
My homies is making it elsewhere
Striving, working nine to five with no health care
We both had dreams of being great
But his deferred, and blurred and changed in shaped
It's fate, it wasn't my choice to make
To be great, I'm giving it all it takes
Trying to shake, the crates and fakes and snakes
I gotta take, my place or fall from grace
The foolish way, the pace is quick and great
Smiling face, to hide the trace of heat
But my homie would never do me wrong
That's why I wrote this song, if you ever need me it's on
No matter who the foe they must fall
Us against them all I'm down to brawl if my homies call


Brenda's Got A Baby

Brenda's got a Baby
Brenda's got a Baby

I hear Brenda's got a baby
But, Brenda's barely got a brain
A damn shame
Tha girl can hardly spell her name
(That's not our problem, that's up ta Brenda's family)
Well let me show ya how it affects tha whole community
Now Brenda never really knew her moms and her dad was a
junky
Went in debt to his arms, it's sad
Cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know
Just cause your in tha ghetto doesn't mean ya can't grow
But oh, that's a thought, my own revelation
Do whatever it takes ta resist tha temptation
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
Her boyfriend was her cousin, now lets watch tha joy end
She tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family
Who didn't really care to see, or give a damn if she
Went out and had a church of kids
As long as when tha check came they got first dibs
Now Brendas belly is gettin bigger
But no one seems ta notice any change in her figure
She's 12 years old and she's having a baby
In love with tha molester, whos sexin her crazy
And yet she thinks that he'll be with her forever
And dreams of a world with tha two of them are together,
whatever
He left her and she had tha baby solo, she had it on tha
bathroom floor
And didn't know so, she didn't know, what ta throw away and
what ta keep
She wrapped tha baby up and threw him in tha trash heep
I guess she thought she'd get away
Wouldn't hear tha cries
She didn't realize
How much tha tha little baby had her eyes
Now tha babys in tha trash heep balling
Momma can't help her, but it hurts ta hear her calling
Brenda wants ta run away
Momma say, you makin' me lose pay, tha social workers here
everyday
Now Brenda's gotta make her own way
Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay
No money no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job
She tried ta sell crack, but end up getting robbed
So now what's next, there ain't nothin left ta sell
So she sees sex as a way of leavin hell
It's payin tha rent, so she really can't complain
Prostitute, found slain, and Brenda's her name, she's got a baby

Baaaaaaaaby

(don't you know she's got a baby)
(don't you know she's got a baby)
(don't you know she's got a baby)
(don't you know she's got a baby)
(don't you know she's got a baby)
(don't you know she's got a baby)


Ohh shit! Jumped on my man's dick
Heard he had a twelve inch, now the bitch is lovesick
Who's to blame, the guy or the groupie?
Heard I was down with D.U., now she wants to do me
Oooh-wee! This is the life
New bitch every night, never tripped off a wife
It ain't right, but it's cool how they come quick
Don't try to flip with the lip cause I run shit
Hip hip, hooray for the AK
Spray when I lay competition, what a great day
Make pay, next is the wet sex
Hexed with the vex now they wreck with the complex
I'm set, wonder what I tote, check
Bloody as a coat-check, snappin motherfuckers necks
Revenge so sweet when it comes from
niggaz get done with the drum, watch my foes run
Nigga keeps comin when they can't slip
Full of that shit, another hit from Tha' Lunatic




Leave me the fuck alone, you gets none of this
It's suicidal, you lose your title like Doug-las
Cause I'm nothin nice and, I'm icin like Tyson
I'm grippin the mic and, my DJ is slicin
I'm tired of motherfuckers steppin to me with the SAME OLD
Tryin to do me like Nintendo
How the fuck you think I ever got this far?
By bootin motherfuckers like a shootin star
Cause I'm out to show, that I'm a dope MC
Think crack had you fiendin, wait'll they get a load of me
Bitches on my dick, like a motherfuckin 'conda
Niggaz wanna flip, let em step, and I'll bomb em
See somethin you want, why don't you come and get it
And then get waxed and taxed, like the government
Then I leave you sittin there, wonder where your money went
While your bitch is callin me, tellin me to come again
Nigga I'm loc'ed, when I smoke, from the indo
But we can be friends though, after you get broke like a window
That's what you provoked, and now you're smoked out
Lookin like a bitch, cause your whole fuckin posse, broke out
Punk motherfucker couldn't roll on
He couldn't hold on, game is too strong, nigga
Leave me the fuck alone, you gets none of this
Feel the wrath.. and revenge of Tha' Lunatic




Recognize game when it smacks your bitch I'm back to rip
Puttin this on the map with this mackin shit
Time will tell if it's made well
Well I raise hell and excel cause it pays well
Jordan couldn't dunk it any harder, pump it any farther
I'm funky, that's word to the father
Act like you know 'fore I thump, the bolo
Thought you was a pimp, now you're simpin for my solo
Oh no, not another new jack, swearin that he's ruthless
Ducked, and now he's fucked and left toothless
I can hear the fear in your flow, you ain't prepared
You're scared and you're bound to go
It's somethin, I guess I let the beat keep bumpin
Stop trippin off these niggaz cause they ain't about nuttin
Or should I say NAYthin
Punk put my tape in, fuck all the fake-in
I'm sick of the bullshit
Come equipped and get ready to rip
or get the dick of Tha' Lunatic


Fuck all them niggaz
I'm tellin these niggaz that they ain't got..
NAYthin on a nigga like me
We squashin these punk motherfuckers in ninety-one
ninety-two ninety-three.. and SO on
So let the beat FLOAT on
While I spray these PUNK BITCHES
with these dope ass lyrics
Thanks to Poppa for supplyin the DANK
Now it's money in the BANK
And all y'all niggaz shit STANK
compared to this shit..


They just can't stand the reign, or the occasional pain
from a man like me, who goes against the grain
Sometimes I do it in vain, so with a little bass and treble
Hey Mister! It's time for me to explain that I'm the rebel
Cold as the devil
Straight from the underground, the rebel, a lower level
They came to see the maniac psychopath
The critics heard of me, and the aftermath
I don't give a damn and it shows
And when I do a stage show I wear street clothes
So they all know me
The lyrical lunatic, the maniac emcee
I give a shout out to your homies
And maybe then, the critics'll leave your boy alone, G
On the streets or on TV
It just don't pay to be, a truth tellin MC
They won't be happy till I'm banned
The most dangerous weapon: an educated black man
So point blank in your face, pump up the bass
and join the human race
I throw peace to the Bay
Cause from the Jungle to Oaktown, they backin me up all the way
You know you gotta love the sound
It's from the rebel -- the rebel of the underground

Rebel he's a rebel, rebel of the underground 


Now I'm face to face with the devils
Cause they breedin more rebels than the whole damn ghetto
And police brutality
shit it put you in the nip and call it technicality
So you reap what you sow
So reap the wrath of the rebel, jackin em up once mo'
Now the fox is in the henhouse, creepin up on your daughter
While you sleep I got her sneakin out
Tupac ain't nuttin nice
I'll be nuttin how I wanna, and doin what I'm gonna
Now I'm up to no good
The mastermind of mischief movin more than most could
So sit and slip into the sound
Peep the rebel -- the rebel of the underground

Rebel he's a rebel, rebel of the underground 


They say they hate me, they wanna hold me down
I guess they scared of the rebel -- the rebel of the underground
But I never let it get me
I just make another record bout the punks tryin to sweat me
In fact, they tryin to keep me out
Try to censor what I say
cause they don't like what I'm talkin bout
So what's wrong with the media today?
Got brothers sellin out cause they greedy to get paid
But me, I'm comin from the soul
And if it don't go gold, my story still gettin told
And that way they can't stop me
And if it sells a couple of copies, the punks'll try to copy
It's sloppy, don't even try to
I'm a slave to the rhythm, and I'm about to fly through
So yo to the people in the ghetto
When ya hear the bass flow, go ahead and let go
Now everybody wanna gangbang
They talkin street slang, but the punks still can't hang
They makin records bout violence
But when it comes to the real, some brothers go silent
It kinda make you wanna think about
that ya gotta do some sellin out, just to get your record out
But 2Pacalpyse is straight down
So feel the wrath of the rebel -- the rebel of the underground

Tupac is a rebel, rebel of the underground 




Meet Cindi, she's twenty-two, lives right on the dope track
Used to be fat now weighs less than a Tic-Tac
Now what's that say about, this big epidemic
This hypocritical world, and the people in it
Now speaking of in it Cindi loved to get buckwild
Fuck with a smile single file she'll bust nuff styles
That would be cool, if she was your lover
But fuck that, Cindi was my dope fiend mother
Welfare checks never stepped through the front door
Cuz moms would run to the dopeman once more
All those days, had me fiending for a hot meal
Now I'm a crook, got steel, I do not feel
So don't even trip, when I flip, with my thirty-eight
Revenge is a bitch, and my hit shake the murder rate
Word to the mutha, I'm touched
When moms come by, niggaz hush or get rushed
Maybe one day she'll recover
But what will it take, to shake, or break
My part time mutha

I gotta live with a part time
A part time
A part time
She's a (part time mutha)
A part time
A part time
She's a (part time mutha)

I grew up in a home where no-one liked me
Moms would hit the pipe, everynight, she would fight me
Poppa was a nasty old man, like the rest
He's feeling on my chest, with his hand in my dress
Just another pest, and yes I was nervous
Blood sensor tests, I just don't deserve this
I wanna tell mom, but would she listen
She's bound to be bitchin if she hasn't got a fix in
So... now I lay me down to sleep
Lord don't let him rape me
If he does my soul to keep
Don't let the devil take me
Can't concentrate I contemplate in my classroom
Thinkin how my step dad, raped me in the bathroom
Every day I make class, and yet I'm missing periods
The thought of pregnancy is in my head and now I'm fearing it
I gotta tell mom, before she sees me
I told her how he G'd me, and she didn't believe me
Callin me a slut cuz my butt's kinda big so
Still that ain't no way to be talkin to your kids though
I can't believe the way you call it
Gotta believe in him, and dissin her own daughter
Time for me to break and find another
That's when I discovered
The ways of the days of a part time mutha

I got a part time
A part time
A part time
She's a (part time mutha)
Part time
A part time
A part time mutha
She's a (part time mutha)

I rush to tend her, talked as I touch her
She blushed, the clothes came off, and I bust her
I'm up now, ready to get drunk on the block
Here, take a cab, thanks a lot for the cot
She's gone, and I'm thinkin that my game's so strong
Pat myself on the back and move on
Is this just how it is hell no
Cuz she came back with the kid and yo
I been payin ever since
The clothes the food the cars and oh the rent
All of my time gets spent at the workplace
No time to kiss her got me list in the first place
So I do the dishes and clean the floor
When I sleep I can't dream anymore
Oh no... now I'm a part time mutha
And I, change the diapers and clean the shit
The tables are turned I can't take this
Oh no... now I'm a part time mutha

A part time
A part time mutha
Now I'm a part time mutha
I'm a (part time mutha)
A part time
A part time
Part time
Now I'ma (part time mutha)
She's a part time
A part time mutha
He's a part time mutha
She's a (part time mutha)
A part time
A part time
A part time
Part time mutha
A part time
A part time mutha
Pa-pa-pa-part time
Pa-pa-pa-part time...







Aww yeah, uhh, uhh
Holla if ya hear me, yeah!


Here we go, turn it up, let's start
From block to block we snatchin hearts and jackin marks
And the punk police can't fade me, and maybe
We can have peace someday G
But right now I got my mind set up
Lookin down the barrel of my nine, get up
Cause it's time to make the payback fat
To my brothers on the block better stay strapped, black
And accept no substitutes
I bring truth to the youth tear the roof off the whole school
Oh no, I won't turn the other cheek
In case ya can't see us while we burn the other week
Now we got him in a smash, blast
How long will it last 'til the po' gettin mo' cash
Until then, raise up!
Tell my young black males, blaze up!
Life's a mess don't stress, test
I'm givin but be thankful that you're livin, blessed
Much love to my brothers in the pen
See ya when I free ya if not when they shove me in
Once again it's an all out scrap
Keep your hands on ya gat, and now ya boys watch ya back
Cause in the alleys out in Cali I'ma tell ya
Mess with the best and the vest couldn't help ya
Scream, if ya feel me; see it clearly?
You're too near me -

Pump ya fists like this
Holla if ya hear me - PUMP PUMP if you're pissed
To the sell-outs, livin it up
One way or another you'll be givin it up, huh
I guess cause I'm black born
I'm supposed to say peace, sing songs, and get capped on
But it's time for a new plan, BAM!
I'll be swingin like a one man, clan
Here we go, turn it up, don't stop
To my homies on the block gettin dropped by cops
I'm still around for ya
Keepin my sound underground for ya
And I'ma throw a change up
Quayle, like you never brought my name up
Now my homies in the backstreets, the blackstreets
They fell me when they rollin in they fat jeeps
This ain't just a rap song, a black song
Tellin all my brothers, get they strap on
And look for me in the struggle
Hustlin 'til other brothers bubble -


Will I quit, will I quit?
They claim that I'm violent, but still I keep
representin, never give up, on a good thing
Wouldn't stop it if we could it's a hood thing
And now I'm like a major threat
Cause I remind you of the things you were made to forget
Bring the noise, to all my boyz
Know the real from the bustas and the decoys
And if ya hustle like a real G
Pump ya fists if ya feel me, holla if ya hear me
Learn to survive in the nine-tre'
I make rhyme pay, others make crime pay
Whatever it takes to live and stand
Cause nobody else'll give a damn
So we live like caged beasts
Waitin for the day to let the rage free
Still me, till they kill me
I love it when they fear me -




"You could get the finger.. the middle!" 
"Come and get some!" 

I thought I hit rock bottom, they ban my album, point the finga
I guess nobody loves a real nigga-slash-rap singer
I thought I'd bring a little truth to the young troops
I brought proof that the niggaz need guns too
It's not to be a racist, but let's face this:
wouldn't you if we could trade places?
I got lynched by some crooked cops, and to this day
them same motherfuckers on the beat gettin major paid
But when I get my check they takin tax out
So, we payin for these pigs to knock the blacks out
Ain't that a bitch, some officers are gettin rich
Whoopin on thugs and robbin drug dealers for they shit
As far as jealousy, bein a celebrity
No matter who committed the crime, they all yell at me
And the media is greedier than most
You could sell em your soul or they'll be on ya til a niggaz ghost
And everyday I read the paper there's another lie
They show my picture for the crimes of another guy
Now how's that for the life of a big shot
A dead cop, a law suit, a little kid shot
I play them nuttin ass marks in the park
for tryin to earn they stripes in the dark
Just cause I come there, don't mean I from there, peep:
only jealous motherfuckers beef, and point the finga



Boom boom boom on your black ass, bitch


As I run up on em madman, a nutcase with a screw loose
A zoot troupe full of foolies with toolies
Niggaz run to me don't come to me with beef
Take your jewels and your jeep, boom boom! Let that ass sleep
It's gettin hectic, niggaz run, quick
Buckshots are the payback for dumb shit
All you niggaz on the block tryin to test me
Best wear a vest or get open like, sesame
I'll run up on you mad deep; while you're tryin to sleep
I'm steady pumpin bullets in your sheets
Wake up, motherfucker, don't stutter
Point blank by a nigga from the gutter, yeah!
Gimme mine, gimme mine, gimme, mine
Ban my rhymes, now I'm back to bustin, nines
And bustaz can't get none, hell no
A quick flurry and he's buried with a swelled jaw
I came up from the amateurs to pro hits
at 5-0, so you know I take no shit
And everybody wants to kill a bringer
of bad news, so they choose, to point the finga


One two three, peace to the real G's
Still me, til these motherfuckers kill me
I bring skills and I build, kill at will
Smoke sess til I'm ill, still feel me?
I say one two three, peace to the real G's
Still me, til these motherfuckers kill me
Pick it up, pick it up, give it up
Best to duck or get fucked for your bucks
Scream one two three, peace to the real G's
Still me, til these motherfuckers kill me
I can't give up, it's a black thang
And I ain't goin back to the crack game
(You can do it son; be a man and stand up or run)
Bitches, let em point the finga
(You can do it son; be a man and stand up or run)
Snitches, let em point the finga
Yo, one two three, peace to the real G's
Still me, til these motherfuckers kill me
I guess nobody loves a rap singer
That's why these motherfuckers.. (hahaha!) point the finga


I've changed...
You mothafuckas kill me
I've changed...

It ain't that i've changed
But it's strange how you mothafuckas rearrange
When I found fame
Point ya finger at tha bad guy

You know what my momma usta tell me
If ya can't find something ta live 4

Then you BEST, find something ta die 4

(eazy saying 'if there's hell below, we're all gonna
go'--this is all through out tha interlude)

Deep deep

La'tasha Hardings
Remember that name...
Cause a bottle of juice...
Ain't something 2 die 4

Young Quaid
Remember that name...
Cause all you mothafuckas
That go to your grave with that name on your brain
Cause jelousy and recklousness
Is NOT, something 2 die 4

All you Niggas out there
[echoed laughter]
Got a crack that crumbles
When I say all you Niggas (all you niggas)
Unite
One nigga, teach 2 niggas
4 niggas teach more niggas
All tha poor niggas
Tha penn niggas
Tha rich niggas
Tha strong niggas
UNITE

There's more of us than there is of them
Look around...
Check your strip

Deep deep

That's something 2 die 4

Black

That's something 2 live 4

What do I know?


Last Wordz
Ice cube's in the mutha-fuckin' house

Got any last wordz


Now they're after me, why? cuz a niggas black
Sit back
Ain't afraid to pull a triggar back
Let 'em come step to a real mutha-fucker
[Boom, Boom] Mama ain't raised no suckers
Dan Quayle, don't you know you need to get your ass kicked
Where was you when there was niggas in the caskets?
Mutha-fucker rednecks all the same
Feel a real nigga if he ain't balled and chained
That's why we burn shit and wreck
Cause the punk police ain't learned shit yet
You mutha-fuckas gonna pay the price
Can't make a Black life, don't take a Black life
It's on, the next real nigga fall dead
Dred, jheri curl, process, or bald head
Be prepared for the smoke to bust
What niggas need to do is start loc'in up
United we stand divided we fall
They can shoot one nigga
But they can't take us alll
Let's get along with the Mexicans
And we can all have peace on the sets again
Imagine that if it took place [ha ha ha]
Keeping the smile off their white fakes
I ain't racist but lets trade places
Trace the hate 'n face it
One nigga teach two niggas
three teach four niggas
And them niggas teach more niggas
And when we blast
That'll be the biggest blast you've heard
And them is my last wordz

My attitude is shitty

Strugglin, jugglin, got it to the black man
Eatin the scams like I was motherfuckin Pac Man
Cops step off, you know the flavor
They fear the ruffneck niggaz with the lunatic behavior
And now we gotta eat, gotta make ends meet
Stabbin for a fee, it gets hard on the fuckin streets
It's like a madness, fuck making gravy
I rhyme and do crimes, cuz either way pays me
A little rough with a hardcore... theme
Couldn't rough something rougher in your... dreams
Mad rugged so you know we're gonna... rip
With that roughneck nigga named 2Pacalypse
Representing YG'z yo
Flip Stretch Homicide and my nigga Gambino
Seek and Po can't forget Money Bags
Stickin up spots and jumpin in Jags
Gotta get ahead and always stay bumblin
And always keep a hand on the gat
Cuz a niggaz straight strugglin



I used to be on tour, but now I'm sick of strugglin
I thought about bumpin, but mother-fuck jugglin
I know it lasts longer, gets my pockets thicker
But I'd rather use my gun cause I get the money quicker, so bust it
Look as I cut the records hard to eject
A quick clip threw my body down uhh! it's another hit
I got energy to blast now you want the task here
Cuz of the light a motherfucker shot that ass up
But rugged and rough is how I'm steppin
Mac is the weapon, and it's always kept in
Eye on the Mac cause the dogg got it goin on
If you come up steppin you'll be lit like a hick
So you better chill, cause I got too much money to get
A street thug in the motherfuckin house, I'm strugglin
Get drunk but I don't think
I'm just in it for the money, don't be a punk snitch
When I yank up my gun, don't run don't bitch
Cause ya know if you do, you'll be layin in a ditch
You'll get your stupid ass blown out the frame
Cause I'm playing to win, and survive in the game
I'm strugglin



Big up, big up, got him in the frame, bang
Ain't nothin changed set it off I let the brains hang
Guess who's back, to put niggaz on they back
Till I call back, niggaz runnin free better fall back
I'm fifty niggaz deep beat sleep
with a Mossberg wrapped in my seats
three deep in my Jeep chief run with the Young Gunz
Strugglin and strivin, that's how the dough come
Now get gunned by the one with the gun for the low goal
Throw a bolo so low when I flow yo
Much too high to read the signs, I'm blind
Clickin on the nine, out to get mine
I go big up, big up, gotta make the room, boom
Blowin motherfuckers to the moon
Niggaz need to feel me a real G, home from the bumblin
See me on the block, strugglin
And rollin with the roughnecks nuff checks cashed
I get in niggaz ass, blast
Straight strugglin



 


A coward dies a thousand deaths
A soldier dies but once


They say pussy and paper is poetry power and pistols
Plottin on murderin motherfuckers 'fore they get you
Picturin pitiful punk niggaz coppin pleas
Puffin weed as I position myself to clock G's
My enemies scatter in suicidal situations
Never to witness the wicked shit that they was facin
Pockets is packed with presidents, pursue your riches
Evadin the playa hatin tricks, while hittin switches
Bitches is bad-mouth, cause brawlin motherfuckers is bold
But y'all some hoes, the game should be sewed
I'm sick of psychotic society somebody save me
Addicted to drama so even mama couldn't raise me
Even the preacher and all my teachers couldn't reach me
I run in the streets and puffin weed wit my peeps
I'm duckin the cop, I hit the weed as I'm clutchin my glock
Niggaz is hot when I hit the block, what if I die tonight

]
Polishin pistols prepare for battle pass the pump
When I get to poppin niggaz is droppin then they done
Callin the coroner come collect the fuckin corpse
He got it by killer, preoccuppied with bein boss
Revenge is the method, whenever steppin keep a weapon close
Adversaries are overdosed over deadly notes
Jealous niggaz and broke bitches equal packed jails
Hit the block and fill your pockets makin crack sales
Picture perfection pursuin paper with a passion
Visions of prisons for all the pussies that I blasted
Runnin with criminals individuals with no remorse
Try to stop me my pistol posse's usin deadly force
In my brain all I can think about is fame
The police know my name, a different game, ain't a thing changed
I'm seein cemetary photos of my peers
Conversatin like they still here, if I die tonight


Pussy and paper is poetry power and pistols
Plottin on murderin motherfuckers 'fore they get you
Pray to the heavens three-fifty-sevens to the sky
And I hope I'm forgiven for Thug Livin when I die
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto for Thug niggaz
A stress free life and a spot for drug dealers
Pissin while practicin how to pimp and be a playa
Overdose of a dick, while drinkin liquor when I lay her
Pistol whippin these simps, for bein petrified and lame
Disrespectin the game, prayin for punishment and pain
Goin insane, never die, live eternal, who shall I fear?
Don't shed a tear for me nigga I ain't happy hear
I hope they bury me and send me to my rest
Headlines readin MURDERED TO DEATH, my last breath
Take a look picture a crook on his last stand
Motherfuckers don't understand, if I die tonight



Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in the city, the cops is hot for me
The projects is full of bullets, the bodies is droppin
There ain't no stoppin me
Constantly movin while makin millions
Witnessin killings, leavin dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Carries to children cause they're illin
Addicted to killin and the appeal from the cap peelin
Without feelin, but will they last or be blasted?
Hard headed bastard
Maybe he'll listen in his casket -- the aftermath
More bodies being buried -- I'm losing my homies in a hurry
They're relocating to the cemetary
Got me worried, stressin, my vision's blurried
The question is will I live? No one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin this anger
Don't wanna make excuses, cause this is how it is
What's the use unless we're shootin no one notices the youth
It's just me against the world baby



Could somebody help me? I'm out here all by myself
See ladies in stores, Baby Capone's, livin wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin
Seein Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons, already crazy
and screamin I guess them nightmares as a child
had me scared, but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route? For a crooked Outlaw
Veteran, a villian, a young thug, who one day shall fall

Everday there's mo' death, and plus I'm dough-less
I'm seein mo' reasons for me to proceed with thievin
Scheme on the scheming and leave they peeps grieving
Cause ain't no bucks to stack up, my nuts is backed up
I'm bout to act up, go load the Mac up, now watch me klacka
Tried makin fat cuts, but yo it ain't workin
And Evil's lurking, I can see him smirking
when I gets to pervin, so what?
Go put some work in, and make my mail, makin sales
Risking 25 with a 'L', but oh well


With all this extra stressin
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finaly get to rest? Through this supression
they punish the people that's askin questions
And those that possess, steal from the ones without possesions
The message I stress: to make it stop study your lessons
Don't settle for less - even the genius asks-es questions
Be grateful for blessings
Don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let the pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin of riches, in a position of makin a difference
Politicians and hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nuttin like the game
It's just me against the world



I shall not fear no man but God
Though I walk through the valley of death
I shed so many tears (if I should die before I wake)
Please God walk with me (grab a nigga and take me to Heaven)

Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone I grew up amongst a dyin breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me can you feel me? I'm not livin in the past, you wanna last
Be tha first to blast, remember Kato
No longer with us he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets
Now rest in peace
Is there heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears

Ahh, I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears..
Lord, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

Now that I'm strugglin in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world cause I'm cursed, I'm havin visions
of leavin here in a hearse, God can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure, and all the pain
Show me some happiness again, I'm goin blind
I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin well
I know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail?
My life is in denial, and when I die,
baptized in eternal fire I'll shed so many tears

Lord, I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears..
Lord, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears
I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me
My every move is a calculated step, to bring me closer
to embrace an early death, now there's nothin left
There was no mercy on the streets, I couldn't rest
I'm barely standin, bout to go to pieces, screamin peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin the flame
inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just a misery
Paintin a picture of my enemies killin me, in my sleep
Will I survive til the mo'nin, to see the sun
Please Lord forgive me for my sins, cause here I come...

Lord, I suffered through the years (God) and shed so many tears..
God, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

Lord knows I.. tried, been a witness to homicide
Seen drivebys takin lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin high
This ain't the life for me, I wanna change
But ain't no future right for me, I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin crazy
Disillusioned lately, I've been really wantin babies
so I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady, cause she's a product of this poison
I'm hearin noises, think she fuckin all my boys, can't take no more
I'm fallin to the floor; beggin for the Lord to let me in
to Heaven's door -- shed so many tears
(Dear God, please let me in)

Lord, I've lost so many years, and shed so many tears..
I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears
Lord, I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears..
God, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears


Temptations

Yo Mo Bee main, drop that shit!


You know what time, boo-yaow
I know it's time for you
So grab one by the hand youknowhatI'msayin
And uhh, throw up that finger
Ay yo yo yo throw y'all fingers up!
Thug style baby, Thug style y'know?



Tell me baby are you lonely? Don't wanna rush ya
I can help ya if ya only, let me touch ya
If I'm wrong love tell me, cause I get caught up
and the life I live is Hell see, I never thought I'd see
the day when I would calm down, you ain't heard
I've been known to clown and Get Around, that's my word
See you walkin and you lookin good, yes indeed
Got a body like a sex fiend, you're killin me
witcha attitude to match right, don't be phony
cause I hate when you act like, you don't know me
I've be stressin in the spotlight, I want the fame
but the industry's a lot like, a crap game
Ain't no time for commitment, I gotta go
Can't be wit you every minute miss, another show
And even though I'm known for my one night stand
I wanna be an honest man, but temptations go...



Throw up the finger!
And all my homies go..
Throw them the finger!
Ya know what baby it's like


I know you've been searchin for someone
To make you happy, and get the job done
You say you need it, a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care



Will I cheat or will I be committed, heaven knows
Gettin weak and I wanna hit it, so here I go
in my ride and I'm all in, gettin high
I can hear the people callin, I'm passin by
Everybody knows I'm ball-in, and to God
Gotta keep myself from fall-in, but it's hard
All the cuties know I'm under pressure, what do I do
Gettin shaky when she pull the dress up, and say it's cool
Should I stroke or should I wait a while, you decide
If you tell me that you don't want it, that's a lie
Move close and let me whisper, some dirty words
in your ears as I kiss ya, on every curve
Slow down baby don't rush, I like it slow
Can't hold it any longer, so let it go
Open the gates, do you wanna fall up in heaven
Don't worry, I let myself in, all I heard was...



Give em the finger!
All my homies go..
Throw your fingers up!
That's just the Thug in me girl, you know
Peep out all my homies, y'know, it's like


I know you've been searchin for someone
To make you happy, and get the job done
You say you need it, a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care



A lot of people think it's easy, to settle down
Got a woman that'll please me, in every town
I don't wanna but I gotta do it, the temptation
got me ready to release the fluid, sensation
sit down and conversate like you know me, take my hand
Cause even Thugs get lonely, understand
Even the hardest of my homies need attention
Catch you blowin up the telephone, reminiscin
I wanna take you to the movies, and the park
Let's find a spot for you to do me, in the dark
Now that it's passion, hold me tight
Don't need lights, I can see you by the moonlight
I know your man ain't lovin you right
You're lonely and depressed you need a Thug in your life
Enough talkin, you want me to leave, I'll get to walkin
See you later, cause baby I'm a player, and all I heard was



Give em the finger
And all my homies go.. yo this how we gonna do this in the nine-trey y'know?
Throw your fingers up
Y'know? They gonna peep this, this how we run game on you


Everybody, heyy, alright
Heyy, heyyyeah, heyyyayyy, ohh


All my niggaz go
Uptown in the
Give em the finger!
Throw your hands up
Give em the finger!


Young Niggaz

I wanna dedicate this one to Robert 'Yummy' Sanderford
and all other lil' young niggaz that's in a rush to be gangstas

As a young nigga, I'm almost ?swellin? in the wind
Give anythang, to be that innocent again, when I was ten
I didn't bang but I was hangin with the homies
tell them niggaz started slangin that they don't know me
I got my hustle on, learned to ignore what couldn't pay me
Lately I've been tryin to make a bill-ion, can you play me
with that jealousy they need to miss me, don't sweat me
If them cowards really want me, come get me, and even I
someday will die but I'm cautious, I'm fin' to ride
Put down the top, now we flossin
Hit the freeway, let the wind blow, drop the window
Workin with a twenty sack of indo, feelin good
Stop through the hood, grab the young thugs
And I can't help but reminisce back when we slung drugs, know it's bad
but all we had was our hopes and dreams
Couldn't see unless we learned to slang dope to fiends
as young niggaz

He's the kind of G like everybody knows
As a young nigga
He's always G'd up, from head to toe
My memories as a young nigga
Always got it blown like Al Capone
Young nigga
He's the downest G I've ever known

Back in Junior High, when we was barely gettin by, when daddy died
That's when my momma started gettin high
My neighborhood was full of drivebys, couldn't survive
All our homies livin short lives, I couldn't cry
Told my momma if I did die, just put a blunt in my casket
let me get my dead homies high
Come follow me throughout my history, it's just
_Me Against the World_ stuck in misery; as a young nigga
My only thing was to be paid
Life full of riches avoid snitched cause they shady, back in the days
We always found the time to play,
but that's before they taught them gangbangers how to spray
Not just L.A., but in the Bay and in Chicago and even St. Louis
Every stadium that I go, when will they change?
Stuck in the game like a dumb nigga
Remember how it was, to be a young nigga

He's the kind of G like everybody knows
As a young nigga
He's always G'd up, from head to toe
My memories as a young nigga
Always got it blown like Al Capone
Young nigga
He's the downest G I've ever known

I'm tellin you..
.. to be young, have your brains and have every ? and all that
Yo, y'all niggaz don't know how good you really do got it
Muh'fuckers need to just calm down
and peep what the fuck they wanna do for the rest of the life
'Fore you end your life before you BEGIN your life
You dumb nigga

Now that I'm grown, I got my mind on bein somethin
Don't wanna be another statistic, out here doin nuttin
Tryin to maintain in this dirty game, keep it real
and I will even if it kills me, my young niggaz
break away from these dumb niggaz
Put down the guns and have some fun nigga, the rest'll come nigga
Fame is a fast thang, that gangbangin
puttin niggaz in a casket, murdered for hangin
at the wrong place at the wrong time, no longer livin
Cause he threw up the wrong sign, and every day
I watch the murder rate increases, and even worse
the epidemic and diseases, what is the future?
The projects lookin hopeless, where
more and more borhters givin up and don't care
Sometimes I hate when brothers act up, I hit the weed
and I proceed to blow the track up, for young niggaz

He's the kind of G like everybody knows
For these young niggaz
He's always G'd up, from head to toe
My memories as a young nigga
He always got it blown like Al Capone
Take it slow nigga, it's for the young niggaz
He's the downest G I've ever known
As a young nigga

He's the kind of G like everybody knows
He's always G'd up, from head to toe
Memories as a young nigga
He always got it blown like Al Capone
He's the downest G I've ever known
['Pac talking overlaps singing last four lines]
This go out to the young thugs, the have-nots (you know)
Little bad motherfuckers from the block (that's right)
Them niggaz that's thirteen and fourteen
Drivin Cadillacs, Benzes and shit (I see you boy)
Young motherfuckin hustlers (make that money boy)
Stay strong nigga
You could be a fuckin accountant, not a dope dealer
youknowhatI'msayin? (Go to school nigga, go to school)
Fuck around and, you pimpin out here
You could be a lawyer (really doe)
Niggaz gotta get they priorities straight
(Don't see Johnny Cochran out in this motherfucker)
Really doe.. young niggaz.. little RahRah
(sup nigga) Especially my little cousins don't be no dumb guy
(Don't be a dumb nigga, listen, young niggaz)




Heavy In The Game



Now how can I explain how this game laced, plus with this fame
I got enemies do anything to break me, my attitude changed
Got to the point where I was driven, twenty-four/seven
Money's my mission, just a nigga tryin to make a livin
These busta tricks don't want no mail
They spendin they riches on skanless bitches
who'll stay petrified in jail
It's hell, plus all the dealers want a meal ticket
Jealous-ass bitches, playa-hatin but we still kick it
Always keep my eyes on the prize, watch the police
Seen so much murder, neighborhoods gettin no sleep
But still, I get my money on major, continuously
Communicatin through my pager, niggaz know me
Don't have no homies cause they jealous, I hustle solo
Cause when I'm broke I got no time for the fellas, listen
Ain't nothin poppin 'bout no work nigga, I ain't no joke
Fuck what they say and get your dough nigga
Heavy in the game [1]



Well lemme shoot some of this how heavy type of shit..
Certain niggaz wanna stick to the game, yousea trick to the game
Waitin upon your turn, so when will you learn?
Ain't no turns given, niggaz be twistin and takin shit
Puttin they sack down, then puttin they mack down
Me myself I hustle with finesse yes I'm an Oakland baller
Rule number one: check game, and fo' sho' you gon' respect game
Be yo' own nigga meanin buy yo' own dope
Cause that front shit is punk shit, somethin I never funked with
Be true to this game and this game will be true to you
That's real shit; disrespect, see what this here do to you
That jackin and robbin, despisin your homie
ain't healthy, niggaz be endin up dead 'fore they get wealthy
But not me though, I'm sewin somethin major
so what I reap is boss -- that's why my public status is floss
Went from a, young nigga livin residential
to a, young nigga workin presidential 



I'm just a young black male, cursed since my birth
Had to turn to crack sales, if worse come to worse
Headed for them packed, jails, or maybe it's a hearse
My only way to stack mail, is out here doin dirt
Made my decisions do or die, been hustlin since junior high
No time for askin why, gettin high, gettin mine
Put away my nine, cause these times call for four-five sales
cause life is hell and everybody dies
What about these niggaz I despise -- them loud talkin cowards
shootin guns into crowds, jeapordizin lives
Shoot em right between them niggaz eyes, it's time to realize
follow the rules or follow them fools that die
Everybody's tryin to make the news, niggaz confused
Quit tryin to be an O.G. and pay your dues
If you choose to apply yourself, go with the grain
and come the riches and the bitches and the fame
Heavy in the game 


 


Lord Knows



I smoke a blunt to take the pain out
And if I wasn't high, I'd probably try to blow my brains out
I'm hopeless, they shoulda killed me as a baby
And now they got me trapped in the storm, I'm goin crazy
Forgive me; they wanna see me in my casket
and if I don't blast I'll be the victim of them bastards
I'm loosin hope, they got me stressin, can the Lord forgive me
Got the spirit of a thug in me
Another sip of that drink, this Hennesey got me queasy
Don't wanna earl, young nigga take it easy
Picture your dreams on a triple beam, and it seems
don't underestimate the power of a fiend
To my homies on the block
slangin rocks with your glocks put this tape in your box
When you're runnin from the cops -- and never look back
If they could be black, then they would switch
Open fire on them busta-ass bitches, and Lord knows...



I wonder if the Lord will forgive me or bury me a G
I couldn't let my adversaries worry me
and every single day it's a test, wear a bulletproof vest
and still a nigga stressin over death
If I could choose when a nigga die, figure I'd
take a puff on the blunt, and let my trigga fly
When everyday it's another death, with every breath,
it's a constant threat, so watch yo' step!
You could be next if you want to, who do you run to?
Murderin niggaz, look what it's come to
My memories bring me misery, and life is hard
in the ghetto, it's insanity, I can't breath
Got me thinkin, what do Hell got?
Cause I done suffered so much, I'm feelin shell-shocked
And driveby's an everyday thang
I done lost too many homies to this motherfuckin game
and Lord knows...


One-time! One-time!
Fuck the five-oh cause they after me
Kill me if they could, I'll never let em capture me
Done lost too many niggaz to this gangbangin
Homies died in my arms, with his brains hangin, fucked up!
I had to tell him it was alright, and that's a lie
and he knew it when he shook and died, my God
Even though I know I'm wrong man
Hennesey make a nigga think he strong, man (heh heh)
I can't sleep, so I stay up, don't wanna fuck them bitches
Try to calm me down, I ain't givin up
I'm gettin lost in the weed, man, gettin high
Livin everday, like I'm gon' die (gon' die, gon' die)
I smoke a blunt to take the pain out, and if I wasn't high
probably try to blow my brains out
Lord knows...

(Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
Lord knows!
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
Lord knows.. Jesus..
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
(He is listening! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)

(Lord knows.. Lord knows.. he he.. he.. he.. heeee...)
(Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
(Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
(Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
(Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)








I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin at me
But they can't do nuttin to a G

(Let's get ready to ruuumbllle!!)


Now you know how we do it like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
that get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches


I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin at me
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
Police bustin at me
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah / Got the police bustin at me
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah..


Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind nigga
My ambitions as a ridah!
My ambitions as a ridah!


So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin without heart
Was born rough and rugged, addressin the mad public
My attitude was, "Fuck it," cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
Uhh, and my ambitions as a ridah to catch her
while she hot, and horny, go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear, "Go to the tele hoe"
Equipped with money and a Benz, cause bitch I'm barely broke
I'm smokin bomb-ass weed feelin crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin and prayers, to breakin motherfuckers to pay-up
I got no time for these bitches, cause these hoes tried to play us
I'm on a meal-ticket mission, want a mil', so I'm wishin
Competition got me ripped, on that bullshit they stressin (boo-yaa!)
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's manditory
No guts no glory my nigga bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the bidness so I got with Death Row
Now these money hungry bitches gettin suspicious
Started plottin and plannin on schemes, to come and trick us
But Thug niggaz be on point and game tight (yeah)
Me, Syke and Bogart, wrap it up the same night
Got problems then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggaz is jealous cause deep in they heart they wanna be me
Uhh, yeah, and now ya got me right beside ya
Hopin you listen I catch you payin attention
to my amibitions as a ridah



I won't deny it, I'ma straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
My ambitions as a ridah
Got the police bustin at me
But they can't do nuttin to a G


(I won't deny it, I'ma straight ridah)
Peep it.. it was my only wish to rise
above these jealous coward mutherfuckers I despise
When it's time to ride, I was the first off this side, give me the nine
I'm ready to die right here tonight, and motherfuck they life (yeah nigga!)
That's what they screamin as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
So open fire, I see you kill me (that's all you niggaz got?) witness my steel
Spittin at adversaries envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama come rescue me I'm suicidal thinkin thoughts
I'm innocent, so there'll be bullets flyin when I'm caught
(Shoot!) Fuck doin jail time, better day, sacrifice
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson
Thuggin for life and if you right then nigga die for it
Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it
When it's time to die to be a man you pick the way you leave
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah


My murderous lyrics equipped with spirits of the Thugs before me
Pay off the block evade the cops cause I know they comin for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
Now I'm back my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds, sure as some bitches bleeds
niggaz'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Blast me but they didn't finish, (buck buck buck buck buck)
didn't diminish my powers
so now I'm back to be a motherfuckin menace, they cowards
That's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggaz on my team, so indeed, they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money, I'll have these motherfuckers buried (I been)
gettin much mail in jail, niggaz tellin me to kill it
Knowin when I get out, they gon' feel it
Witness the realest, a whoridah when I put the shit inside
the cry from all your people when they find her
Just remind ya, my history'll prove I been it
Revenge on them niggaz that played me,
and all the cowards that was down widdit
Now it's yo' nigga right beside ya
Hopin you listenin, catch you payin attention
to my ambitions as a ridah





You probably crooked as the last trick; want it light
but how I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch
Thinkin I had her but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck I'm stuck with fuckin with the wrong one, uh!
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin for some love
In every club, I see you starin like you want it
Well baby if you got it better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
I try to holla but you tell me you taken
Sayin you ain't impressed, with the money I'm makin
Guess it's true what they tellin me
Fresh out of jail, life's Hell for a black, celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you widdit
Fantansies of us sweatin, can I hit it? (Hahaha)
Addicted to the things you do, but still true
What I'm sayin Boo, is this is all about you




I make a promise if you go with me, just let me know
I'll have you hollerin my name out before I leave
Nobody loves me I'm a thug nigga; I only hung out
with the criminals and the drug dealers, I love niggaz
cause we comin from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick, the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa, and I don't even care
Creep though, weed smoke's into the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
waitin for niggaz at the end, of every show
I just seen you in my friend's, video
Could never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin through..
It's all about you.. hahaha, yeah nigga!
It's all about you!



Hey Nate you know you got to focus on this motherfucker
We's gonna talk about these scandalous hoes

I can talk about scandalous bitches

Oh I know you can!
I know you that's why we gonna do it
Daz on the beat
Hey Daz, nigga stop fuckin around with the piano nigga
Just drop that shit like uhh, this here


I met you through my homie now you act like you don't know me
So disappointed cause baby that shit was so phony
It's not for me, you see no lovin from my closest homies
Woulda paid you no mind, but baby you was all up on me
While you proceed with precision, you had the table hosed
No, I ain't mad at you baby, go 'head and play them fools
They chose not to listen, so now he stuck inside his house
and can't leave without his bitch permission
The mission's to be a playa, my alias is Boss
Drop a top on these jealous niggaz, playa let me floss
Y'all don't wanna see me in pain
I'll leave that ass like Toni Braxton, "Never breathing again"
It's scandalous, I never liked your back stabbin ass, triiick
Used to watch you money grabbin, who you baggin beeyitch?
Ready to bust, in the city you don't know who to trust
But bitches lookin scandalous



Scandalous.. she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous.. she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
Scandalous.. she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous.. she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous


How's it hangin? Cause baby from the back the shit is bangin
I've been stressin in this ghetto game, tryin to do my thang
Won't be no bullshit, no ass-kissin
This bitch'll have ya wakin up with all your cash missin
I'm askin, as if I'm qualified to analyze
You're lookin at a bitch who specialize in tellin lies
She got a body make a motherfucker fantasize
Her face ain't never shed a tear through them scandalous eyes
My sister ? in poverty
Plus I knew she was a freak bitch so why should it bother me?
I'd probably be sprung, addicted to the heat of her tongue
and though I don't where we're goin, she's makin me come
I've been trained as a boss playa, so what you sayin?
Let me show you, got some hookers we can toss later
Before I let her get me off guard
Went in the purse took a hundred dollars
Nigga I'm so scandalous

Dangerous and ambitious, while schemin on gettin riches
I'm spittin at tricks cause I'm addicted to pretty bitches
Currency motivated, not easily terminated
Now that we made it, my niggaz can never be faded
This is my prophecy -- I gotta be paid
All you cowards that try to stop me is beggin for early graves
I thought we was cool, I was a fool, thinkin you could be true
when I don't fuck with your punk crew
These are the tales for my niggaz doin time in the cell
I went from hell, to livin well
Bustin at niggaz who said my name in vain
I got no time for them tricks, I'm heavy in the game
I wanna be a baller, please
But the bitches and the liquor keep on callin me
I'm floatin free on the highway, formulatin plans
Can't wait til I see L.A., cause it's so scandalous


Aiyyo.. how the prettiest bitch be the more scandalous the hoe be
You ever peep that shit? (Nah)
A bitch can be like fifteen, fuckin with a nigga 35
Gettin him for ends
Hoes these days is way too motherfuckin intelligent
When these niggaz get to trickin, hahaha, it's over then
That's aight though
Keep a nigga heavy in the game, bout so long
Watch them hoes
All you niggaz out there
Beware these lyin ass scandalous bitches


You find an MC like me who's strong
Leavin motherfucker's aborted, with no verbal support
And when I command the microphone I gets deadly as Kahn though
With a bear and a snake and a panda, I'm on those
Who can withstand, the mo' power I gain
and make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck ya brain
Imagine and keep on wishin upon a star
Finally realizing who the fuck we are
When I penetrate, it's been withstandin, faded
would it be the greatest MC of all time
When I created rhyme for the simple fact
When I attack I crush your pride
My intention to ride, every time all night
I'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
for me to put down my guard, I'm faced with it, I'm a ride
breakin in gas with the six-eight all day
In and out with my pay
I'm soon to count the bodies...



So mandatory my elevation my lyrics like orientation
So you can be more familiar with tha nigga you facin
We must be based on nothin better than communication
Known to damage and highly flamable like gas stations
Sorry I left that ass waitin
No more procrastination give up to fate, and get that asss shakin
I'm bustin and makin motherfuckers panic
Don't take ya life for granted put that ass in the dirt
You swear the bitch was planted
My lyrics motivate the planet
It's similar to Rhythm Nation
but thugged out, forgive me Janet
Who's in control I'm acvtivatin yo souls
You know, the way the games get controlled
Yo, two years ago, a friend of mine
Told me Alize and Cristal blows your mind
Bear witness to the dopest fuckin rhyme I wrote
Takin off my coat, clearing my throat



I got my mind made up, come on... (come on)
get in get in too [get on it]
let it ride (get wit it) tonight's tha night
I got my mind made up, come on...
get in get in too
let it ride... tonight's tha night



Well I comes through with two packs
of the bomb prophalaks for protection
So my fuckin sac won't collapse
Cause nowaday's, shit's evading the x-rays
Sending young motherfuckers to an early grave
I wonder, if my terrifying tactics of torturing MC's
shows my heart's as cold as the tundra
Electryfing like thunder, I'm just too much
Rough and raw with that motherfuckin poisonous touch
I'm an MC with lyrics that's tha fuckin bom-bay
Ya got dissed, that's before it's ingest like balmay
My rhymes, I leave a mark on ya mind
As the deadly vibes spread through ya head like sand pine
There's no escape, nah I ain't blastin
I use my mental to assassinate assassin's for those askin
Opposed to laughin, raw maniacal villian
Laughter enhances the chances of tha killin
Why is that? Cuz smilin faces decieve
You best believe, to MC's I'm the deadliest disease
My thoughts rip ya throat and make it hard to breathe
Ya whole camp's under seige, and I'm Jason Vorhees
In the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mikes
My verbal snipe, your vocab on site
I'm out tha cut, uncut and raw with no clause for all
So all my rhymes hit and split tha bricks on the wall
Ya already have an idea about tha superior sphere
The greater rhyme creator on both sides of tha equator
I rock from here to there, to Philly and back
To LA on the spot where I rock and bust like straps
As your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
Beware, set and prepare to enter verbal combat



Fuck you losers, while you fake jacks I makes maneuvers
like Hitler, stickin up [jews] wit german [lugers]
The Mr. Meth-Tical from Staten Isle
Will be back after this mess-age don't touch tha dial
Rarely do you see an MC out for justice
Got my gun powder and my musket -- blaooow!!
Melons get swellings, I paint mental pictures like Magellen
Half of my Clan's three deep felons
Niggaz best protect they joints for Nine-Nickel
Man I stay on point like icicles
Now who wanna test Tical then touch Tical
All up in your motherfuckin mouth
Head banger boogie
Catch me on tour with Al Doogie
Method Man roll too tight, you can pull me
Better take one and pass or that's that ass
Your vital statistics are low and fallin fast
Johnny Blaze out to get loot like Johnny Cash
Play a game of Russian Roulette and have a blast



Aiyyo, lyrical gas spittin tha criminal tactics
Non-believers get my dick and genitals backwards
Let's face it, there's no replacement
Taste this, mad underground basement, shit I'm laced with
Avalanche on ya whole camp when I'm splifted
Funk Doctor who? Spock bitch don't get it twisted
I got connects like Federal Express
to get the fresh package of bless, tha dogs can't fetch
Got the clear spot from tha rear block
to bust til every nigga here drop, men I fear not
Hold ya nose and blow out til ya ears pop
Since ya crew suit you to shift now you claim that you get's lot
With, this underground cannabis
I'm dangerous like John the bomb analyst
Then proceeds like keys
My degrees freeze consecutively like EPMD LP's
Lick off a shot and hit ya fam by mistake
So I erase the whole front row at the wake
I planned my escape in case jake or a snake bust it
I'm the one pushin the hearse in the first place
Confidence for you shaky ass folks
Pump for Rockafella for the day he got smoked
choke, off this anecdote got you ope
Get roast, by my lyrics Billy Dee .45 Colt
And I'm out for nine nickel (INS tha rebels)
West, list this, this, this...

 


Love tha way you agrivate your hips
and push your ass out
gotta nigga wantin'

Mr. International
Playa with tha passport

Deloris Tucker

With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg my fuckin homey
Youse a cold ass nigga on them hogs

Sho nuff, I keep my hand on my gun, cuz they got me on the run
Now I'm back in the courtroom waitin on the outcome
Free Tupac, is all that's on a niggaz mind
But at the same time it seem they tryin to take mine
So I'ma get smart, and get defensive and shit
And put together a million march, for some gangsta shit

Two multimillionare motherfuckers catchin cases (mmm)
Bitches get ready for the throwdown, the shit's about to go down
Uhh, me and Snoop about to clown

Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
And keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, suffering is grief
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck wit me
I bust and flea, these niggaz must be crazy what??
There ain't no mercy motherfuckers who can fade the Thugs
(hahah right) You thought it was but it wasn't, now dissapear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player

It's like cuz, blood, gangbangin
Everybody in the party doin dope slangin
You got to have papers in this world
You might get your first snatch, before your eyes swerl
Ya doing ya job, every day
And then you work so hard til ya hair turn gray
Let me tell you about life, and bout the way it is
You see we live by the gun, so we die by the gun's kids

They tell me not to roll with my glock
So now I gotta throw away
Floatin in the black Benz, tryin to do a show a day
They wonder how I live, with five shots
Niggaz is hard to kill, on my block
Schemes for currency and doe related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm tryin to get up on it
My nigga Dogg with me, eternally the most wanted



Hey DeVante
Nigga, don'tcha know we're gonna sow up every bitch in the country
Me and you, up in the same motherfuckin room
On the same level
This shit here, hahahaha
Please, no more pain
That's right nigga
Hey drop that shit boy



My adversaries cry like hoes fully eradicate my foes
My lyrics explode on contact, gamin you hoes
Who else but Mama's only son, fuck the phony niggaz I'm the one
Say my name, watch bitches come, now fire
when ready, stay watchin now figure, increase speed
Make you motherfuckers bleed from your mouth quicker
Plus all these niggaz that you run with, be on some dumb shit
Trick on the hoes, I ain't the one bitch
Holla my name and witness game official, it's so sick
Have every single bitch that came witchu, on my dick
Plus this alcohol increases the chance to be deceased
I'm movin you stupid bitches, vicious telekenesis
Am I reachin your brain? Nigga how can I explain?
How vicious this Thug motherfucker came
When I die, I wanna be a livin legend, say my name
Affiliated with this motherfuckin game, with no more pain



I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane 
Line up my adversaries, blast on sight, and fuck your boyfriend
Bitch, I want some ass tonight, you know my steelo
Alize and Cristal, weed sure you heard of all the
sure you've heard of all the freaky shit they say about me, huh
Plus all you busters is jealous, pull your gun out and blast
I dare you niggaz to open fire, I'll murder that ass
And disappear before the cops come runnin, my glock's spittin rounds
niggaz fallin down clutchin they stomach
It's Westside, Death Row, Thug niggaz on the rise
Busters shot me five times, real niggaz don't die
Can ya hear me? Laced with this game, I know you fear me
Spit the secret to war, so cowards fear me
My only fear of death is reincarnation
Heart of a solider with a brain to teach your whole nation
And feelin no more pain



Bury me that's what they all say, it's time to make a killin
Sure to make a million with DeVante
Bitch I know you want me, what your mouth say? Now, watch your eyes
You don't wanna get with me, that's a lie
I got my hands on your hips, no time to bullshit
Freaky bitch, come give me kiss
Tell them niggaz from other areas, brothers from here
So obsessed with this money makin it ain't nothin we fear
Now they label me a troublemaker, cause I'm a ridah
Death to you playa haters, don't let me find ya
Mama made me rugged, baptised the public
Now you hard thugs, nigga don't you love it
It's similar to multiple gunshots, retaliation is a must
Wasn't too sure what you facin so watch the guns bust
You niggaz'll bleed, fuckin with me you'll be deceased
Never restin in peace nigga, with no more pain




Hahahahaha, yeah nigga, yeah! Hahahaha
No more pain
It's just like that nigga, like that yeah
No more pain
Motherfuckers can't handle that shit
Much too much for these bitches
No more pain
Feel me nigga? Feel me?
How you figure you can fuck with me?
Fully automatic type shit
No more pain
Coward ass niggaz, cowards
Come put your mouth on this pistol nigga
Come put your mouth on the pistol, no more pain
Close your eyes nigga, do it
Die in the dark, no more pain

Death Row, so what you motherfuckers do?
Hey that's DeVante droppin that beat like that BEYATCH
In case you wonderin
And jealous niggaz, hahaha, see y'all niggaz
Motherfuckin niggaz are shit
Hey


Westsiiiiiide! Death to everybody that ain't down with me
That's on, feel me? Hahaha
Oh yeah, to the cowards, you know what I mean
Just feel that, Thug Life, shit don't stop
Motherfuckers got Downs Syndrome, motherfuckers
Weak ass niggaz, skanless cunts, fuckin C.E..O.'s
Put your mouth on this pistol nigga
Put your mouth on the pistol!
Hahahaha, yeah nigga no more pain
Prison ain't changed me nigga, it made me worse
Feel me nigga, haha
No more pain
Hey DeVante I'm givin these motherfuckers choices
Niggaz can roll with us, or they can be rolled under us
That's on you nigga, what you wanna do?
Last year we was lettin these niggaz kick up dust
This year you motherfuckers gonna be dust
Thug Life nigga Westsiiiiide!

Shorties gonna be's a Thug
Said he's gonna be
One day he gonna be
Say he wanna be
Shorties gonna be a Thug
Said he gonna be
One day he's gonna be
Said he wanna be
Shorties gonna be a Thug



He was a nice middle class nigga
But nobody knew the evil he'd do When he got a little bigger
Get off the final blaze
While puffing on a Newport
plottin' on a another way to catch a case
Was only sixteen, yet convicted as a felon
With a bunch of old niggas
But you the only one who ain't telling
I tell you it's a cold world, stay in school
You tell me its a man's world, play the rules
And fade fools, 'n break rules until we major
Blaze up, getting with hoes through my pager
Was raised up, commencing to money makin' tactics
It's getting drastic, niggas got automatics
My fingers on the trigga, Tell the lord
To make way for another straight Thug Nigga
I'm sitting getting buzzed, looking for some luv
from the homies, cuz shorty wanna be a Thug



Straight from the Hall to the Penn
Adolescent nigga scaling weight and standing Six feet Ten
He carried weight like a Mack truck
Gonna bust on some playa haters
if the mutha fuckas act tuff
Then thats when the lethal weapon with the razor
This little nigga smoking weed and getting blazed up
No one could figure, when the guns blast pull the trigga
Could take the life of a young nigga guns bigger
No mother and father, you see, the niggas all alone
Old timers my role model, the war zone
Released with this game 'til its a part of me
My heart don't beat no fear and it ain't hard to see
The future is looking dim
I'm trying to make a profit out of living in this sin
I'm in the dark getting buzzed, looking for some love
out with the homies, cuz shorty wanna be a Thug



Shorty gonna be a thug

You little bad ass nigga, to the young niggas
gotta stay sharp nigga, play your part
you got plenty of time (you bad mutha fuckas)
You only get three mistakes, then thats life, big baby (niggas craaazy)
watch the signs
Damn, you ain't but sixteen nigga?
Sixteen?!
That's a bad muthafucker


Holla At Me

(Niggas out there jelous cuz we be bailin' with Death Row
They try to playa hate
but they can't fade us tho'
We be mobbin' through tha neigborhood
Yeah

This goes out to you playa
you know...you know who you are


Gotta be carefull, can't let tha evil of tha money trap me
So when ya see me nigga
Ya better Holla at me



Are you confused ?
You wonder how it feels to walk a mile inside tha shoes
of a nigga who don't have a thing to loose
When me and you was homies
no one informed me it was all a scheme
You infiltrated my team and sold a niggas dreams
how could you do me like that ?
I took ya family in
I put some cash in ya pocket
made you a man again
and now you let tha fear put your ass in a place
complicated to escape
It's a fools fate
without your word
your a shell of a man
I lost respect for you nigga
we can never be friends
I know i'm runnin' through your head now
what could you do ?
If it was up to you
i'd be dead now
I let tha world know nigga you a coward
You could never be live
until you die
see tha mothafucken bitch in your eye
Type of Nigga, that let tha evil of tha money trap me
when ya see me nigga
ya better holla at me (holla at me)
can't let tha evil of tha money trap me
So when ya see me nigga
Ya better Holla at me



(You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay)

So I gotta be carefull, can't let tha evil of tha money trap me
so when ya see me nigga
ya better holla at me

(You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay)



courious
spittin' lyrics
on tha verge of furious
i'm addicted to currency
nigga that's why we're doin this
I got shot up, I surprised tha niggas tha way I got up
and then
I hit the studio
It's time to blow tha block up
No hesitation
this information got you contemplatin'
heartbreakin' and eliminatin' with this conversation
break him
and let him see tha face of a mental patient
it's a celebration
of my criminal elevation
with the participation
I want members across tha fifty states
to keep tha nation anticipatin' until we break
will I be great, is it my fate ?
to live tha life of luxury
some niggas bought my tapes
so much jelousy it scares me
so be prepared
cause only tha strong survive
life isn't fair (fair)
probably never knew tha way it feels to die
so you figure fuck with me
I give that ass a try
Nigga, Holla at me



(You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay)

(Ohhhhhh....)



I shoulda saw tha signs
I was blinded
criminal minds of a young black brotha doin' time
so many brothas framed in this dirty game
it's a shame
so much pressure on my brain
while she blame me
Secrets in tha dark
only her and I know
now i'm sitten' in tha state pen
doin time for slow
guess she made a bad decision
that got me livin'
just like an animal
i'm caged up in state prison
my niggas dissin'
cause
hell have no fury like a woman scorn
A cemetary full of mothafuckers got not knowin'
picture my prophecy
tha cops are attacking me, on top of me
i'm runnin' from tha coppers
but never let'em stop me
cause i'm a soulja
hell, ever since I was a little nigga havin' fantasies
of one day getting older
Niggas is paranoid
trust
a no no
love is a mystery
Fuck tha po po,
Holla at me.....
So when you see me nigga
you better holla at me....



(You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay)

(Niggas out there jelous cuz we be bailin' with Death Row
They try to playa hate
but they can't fade us tho'
We be mobbin' through tha neigborhood
Yeah
with that funky sound (so funky)
we be throwin' down)



(You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay)

(Ohhhhhhhh, heeeeyyy, ohhhhh nooo noooo noooooo)


Wonda Why They Call U Bytch



You wonda why they call U bitch
You wonda why they call U bitch.
You wonda why they call U bitch
You wonda why they call U bitch.
You wonda why they call U bitch
You wonda why they call U bitch.



Look here Miss Thang
hate to salt your game
but yous a money hungry woman
and you need to change.

In tha locker room
all the homies do is laugh.
High five's cuz anotha nigga
played your ass.

It was said you were sleeezy
even easy
sleepin around for what
you need

See it's your thang
and you can shake it how you wanna.
Give it up free
or make your money on the corner.

But don't be bad and play the game
get mad and change.
Then you wonda why these muthafuckas
call you names.

Still lookin' for a way out
and that's OK
I can see you wanna stray
there's a way out.

Keep your mind on your money,
enroll in school.
And as the years pass by
you can show them fools.

But you ain't tryin' to hear me
cuz your stuck,
you're headin' for the bathroom
'bout to get tossed up.

Still lookin' for a rich man
you dug a ditch,
got your legs up
tryin' to get rich.

I love you like a sista
but you need to switch
and that's why they called
U bitch, I betcha.



You leave your kids with your mama
cuz your headin' for the club
in a skin tight miniskirt
lookin' for some love.

Got them legs wide open
while you're sittin' at the bar
Talkin' to some nigga
'bout his car.

I guess he said he
had a Lexxxus, what's next?
You headin' to his car for some sex

I pass by
can't hold back tears inside
cuz, lord knows
for years I tried.

And all the other people
on my block hate your guts
Then you wonda why they stare
and call you slut.

It's like your mind don't understand
you don't have to kill your
dreams ploten'
schemes on a man

Keep your head up, legs closed, eyes open
either a nigga wear a rubber or he die smokin'
I'm hearin' rumors so you need to switch
and niggas wouldn't call you bitch, I betcha.



I guess times gettin' hard
even harder for you
cuz, hey now, got a baby
on the way now

More money from the county
and thanks to the welfare
you're about to
get your hair done.

Got a dinner date
can't be late
trick or treat, sweet thang
got anotha trick to meet.

The way he did it
it was smooth
plottin' while he gamin' you
So baby, peep tha rules.

I shoulda seen it in the first case
the worst case
I shoulda never called you back
in the first place.

I remember back in high school
baby you was fast
straight sex
and barely move your ass.

But now things change
cuz you don't look the same
let the ghetto get the best of you
baby, that's a shame

Caught HIV and now you 'bout to be deceased
and finally be in peace.

So where your niggas at now
cuz everybody left
they stepped
and left you on your own

See I loved you like a sista
but you died to quick
And that's why we called U bitch, I betcha.



Dear Ms. Deloris Tucker
keep stressen me
fuckin' with a muthafucken mind
I figured you wanted to know
you know
why we call them hos bitches
and maybe this might help you understand
it ain't personal
strictly business baby
strictly business

So If you wonder why we call U bitch
You wonder why we call U bitch
If you wonder why we call U bitch
You wonder why we call U bitch


When We Ride

Bow down to somethin greater than yourself trick
Individuals capable of enormous amounts of chin checks and eye swolls
They know
You watchin but you ain't seein what lies before you, beatch
Picture if you will seven deadly human beings
blessed with the gift of speech, the power to reach
each nigga on every street
May the Heavenly Father look down and be proud
of what transpired since the day the seed was planted
The G grew but we knew he'd rise up quick
Smoked out, loc'ed out, all into shit
Just me and my dogs livin like hogs
Outlaw Immortalz
What follows is the story, what proceeded was the glue
What lies between is the fiction
Don't fuck around and make it true


Hahahahahaha
My adversaries crumble when we rumble it's a catastrophe
I pull revenge on bitch niggaz that blasted me
Plus my alias is Makaveli
A loaded three-fifty-seven with hollow points to a nigga belly
Bust him to see if he bleed, he shoulda never fucked around
with a sick-ass nigga like me
They call my name out and niggaz run, best be prepared
for the Outlawz, here we come




Thug nigga till we die, no mercy
on these playa hatin bitches, ask me why - when we ride!
Thug nigga till we die, no mercy
on these playa hatin bitches, ask me why - when we ride!

Hehahahahaha, Thug Life, yeah nigga
Flashin on niggaz

Multiple gunshots [fades]

 



Aight, new drink

So come and get some of this thug passion Baby

I could pull out the drink
and be good 'till it's relavent but
I'm a straight solider, I'll roll up a nigga

Tripping over dead presidents

I throw was down with this business
Tryin' clown and get a cent
and so rather
than stand forever, been thinking
drinking over a felony
and hell of me and how it will be some other shit
People telling me to cool out
But they ain't feeling me
a mutha fuckin fool 'bout

and laughing while I pass through times
And all thes back stabbers be watchin
Just keep it plain

twisting riches
But there is only one way to make mo'
so I'm standing on the corner
trying to hustle in the snow
and My bigga bro

To the niggas who kept it real

Traveling this road my poor soul

with all this bullshit I done tolerated
How I made it

Now you can feel it
it's a potion for my niggas in motion
forever blastin'
bitches ain't ready for this Thug Passion








In today's music news: the ever controversial Tupac Shakur has
just released another album under the alias Makaveli.
Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artist
street dates, in fear of a wipeout in retail interchart movement.
Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album;
resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers
have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character
of not only Mr. Shakur, but of Death Row Records as well.
Nas, the alleged ring leader of it, is furious at Tupac
excuse me Makaveli's verbal assault
on Mobb Sleep, Notorius P.I.G., and several other New York rappers
Jay-Z, from "Hawaiian Sophie" fame, Big Little whatever
and several other corny sounding motherfuckers
are understandably shaken up by this release.
The question everbody wants to know is --
why'd they get this nigga started?
Tupac, rather Makaveli, was not available for comment
but released this statement:


It's not about East or West
It's about niggaz and bitches, power and money,
riders and punks. Which side are you on?


These niggaz is still fuckin talkin?
You niggaz still breathin? Fuckin roaches, aight
Aight, it's the Raid for your cockroaches

(All day, everyday)
It's the raid for you punk motherfuckers
(The pump in yo' ass)
This is it nigga! Killuminati style
(Outlaw lifestyle)
Makaveli the Don, solo shit - bring it!


Allow me to introduce first {*gunshot fires*} Makaveli the Don
Hysterical, spiritual lyrics like the holy Qu'Ran
Niggaz get shook like 5-0
My forty-five gun's next to me when we ride, for survival
Money makin plans, pistol close at hand, swollen pockets
Let me introduce the topic, then we drop it
Expose snakes cause they breath freely, see me ride?
Located world wide like the art of graffiti
I think I'm tougher than Nitti, my attitude is shitty
Born on a dopefiend's titty.. huh
In every city you'll find me
Look for trouble right behind me
My Outlaw niggaz down to die for me, knahmean?
I hit the scene niggaz duckin from my guillotine stare
I'm right there; my every word, a fuckin nightmare
Get me high, let me see the sun rise and fall
This for my dogs down to die for yours
Extreme venom, no mercy when we all up in 'em
Cut 'em down.. to Hell is where we send 'em
My whole team, trained to explode ride or die
Murder motherfuckers lyrically, and I'm not gon' cry
Me - a born leader never leave the block without my heater
Two big pits, I call them my bitch nigga eaters
And not a whimper 'til I'm gone
Thug Life runnin through my veins so I'm strong
(Ha ha ha)

Bye bye bye, let's get high and ride
Oh, how do we do these niggaz but I'm not gon' cry
I'm a Bad Boy killa, Jay-Z die too
Lookin out for Mobb Deep, nigga when I find you
Weak motherfuckers don't deserve to breathe
How many niggaz down to die for me? Yeahh-yeayy!
West coast ridah, comin right behind ya
Should've never fucked wit meeee
I want money hoes sex and weeeed
I wont rest till my road dawgs freeee, bomb first!


We, bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider 'fo you die
We ain't even come to hurt nobody tonight
But it's my life or yo' life, and I'ma bomb first
We, bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider 'fo you die
We ain't even come to fight tonight
But it's my life or yo' life, and I'ma bomb first


For so many days and some many ways we've been duckin strays
They delivers, but we still some Bad Boy killers
Got nuttin to lose, I gots no where to go
I only got one home, see me stranded on Death Row
With Outlawz, it's Makaveli, be the general
And I be a soldier on a mission
Sent to do, what you'll never do
and that's ride for the cause
Yes I'll die for the cause
Ya best believe if I'ma leave this bitch
Yo I'm dyin with yours
Kamikaze, sicker than a muh'fuckin Nazi
Got a little question for that nigga that made "Paparazzi"
If you ain't in this rap game, for the motherfuckin cash mayne
then what is your motherfuckin purpose? None can serve us
E.D.I. Amin born worthless
That's until the day, I decided to bomb first BEATCH!!


Your style wack as ever, like you was rockin patent leather
Causin massive terror, y'all niggaz lack, you ain't thorough
Half rapper half drug kingpin
Yer tellin fairy tales dunn
"King of New York," like you the motherfuckin one?
But I'm from Jerz and we don't play that shit
From the Claire down to Newark Bricks, all my niggaz flippin chips
Gettin rich, even though it's hard
Tryin to creep through these halls and brawls
without scarred by a revolv'
with no warnin signs, cause yo my man took five
Now I'm the young one with the nine, ready to put in my time


Shoot first, look at they head burst bleedin
Don't want to hear no shit this evenin, believe me
We, bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider 'fo you die
G's, and thug niggaz on the rise
Plan-plot-strategize, and bomb first
We, bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider 'fo you die
G's, and thug niggaz on the rise
Plan-plot-strategize, and bomb first



Makaveli in this... Killuminati, all through your body
The blow's like a twelve gauge shotty
Uhh, feel me!
And God said he should send his one begotten son
to lead the wild into the ways of the man
Follow me; eat my flesh, flesh and my flesh



Come with me, Hail Mary
Run quick see, what do we have here
Now, do you wanna ride or die
La dadada, la la la la


I ain't a killer but don't push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to gettin pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words bein quoted
Peeped the weakness int he rap game and sewed it
Bow down, pray to God hoping that he's listenin
Seein niggaz comin for me, to my diamonds, when they glistenin
Now pay attention, rest in peace father
I'm a ghost in these killin fields
Hail Mary catch me if I go, let's go deep inside
the solitary mind of a madman who screams in the dark
Evil lurks, enemies, see me flee
Activate my hate, let it break, to the flame
Set trip, empty out my clip, never stop to aim
Some say the game is all corrupted, fucked in this shit
Stuck, niggaz is lucky if we bust out this shit, plus
mama told me never stop until I bust a nut
Fuck the world if they can't adjust
It's just as well, Hail Mary

Penetentiaries is packed with promise makes
Never realize the precious time the bitch niggaz is wastin
Instutionalized I lived my life a product made to crumble
But too hardened for a smile, we're too crazy to be humble, we ballin
Catch me father please, cause I'm fallin, in the liquor store
That's the Hennessee I hear ya callin, can I get some more?
Hail til I reach Hell, I ain't scared
Mama checkin in my bedroom; I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it, what can I do
One life to live but I got nuttin to lose, just me and you
on a one way trip to prison, sellin drugs
We all wrapped up in this livin, life as Thugs
To my homeboys in Quentin Max, doin they bid
Raise hell to this real shit, and feel this
When they turn out the lights, I'll be down in the dark
Thuggin eternal through my heart, now Hail Mary nigga


They got a APB, out on my Thug family
Since the Outlawz run these streets, like these skanless freaks
Our enemies die now, walk around half dead
Head down, K blasted off Hennessee and Thai
Tryin it, mixed it, now I'm twisted blisted and high
Visions of me, Thug livin gettin me by
Forever live, and I multiply survived by Thugs
When I die they won't cry unless they comin with slugs


Peep the whole scene and whatever's goin on around me
Brain kinda cloudy, smoked out feelin rowdy
Ready to wet the party up, and whoever in that motherfucker
Nasty new street, slugger my heat seeks suckers
on the regular mashin in a stolen black Ac Integ-ra
Cock back, sixty seconds til the draw that's when I'm dead in ya
Feet first, you got a nice gat but my heat's worse
From a Thug to preachin church, I gave you love now you eatin dirt
Needin work, and I ain't the nigga to put you on
Cause word is bond when I was broke I had to hustle til dawn
That's when sun came up, there's only one way up
hold ya head and stay up, to all my niggaz get ya pay and weight up


If it's on then it's on, we break beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate
to this shit I don't got, be the shit I gotta take
Dealin with fate, hoping God don't close the gate
If it's on then it's on, we break beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate
to this shit I don't got, be the shit I gotta take
Dealin with fate, hoping God don't close the gate


We've been traveling on this wayward road
Long time til I be take a 'eavy load
But we ride, ride it like a bullet
Hail Mary, Hail Mary
We won't worry everyting will come real
Free like the bird in the tree
We won't worry everyting will come real
Yes we free like the bird in the tree
We runnin from the penitentiary
This is the time for we liberty
Hail Mary, Hail Mary


Westside, Outlawz, Makaveli the Don, Solo, Killuminati, The 7 Days


Toss It Up



The money behind the dreams

My other Capo in this big ass, conglomerate called Death Row
Snoop motherfuckin Dogg, Tha Doggfather
And who he comin through right now, Makaveli the Don
Feel this, Killuminati

(Toss it up!)
Lord have mercy, father help us all
Since you supllied yo' phone number, I can't help but call
Time for action, conversatin, we relaxin, kickin back
Got you curious for Thug Passion, now picture that
Tongue kissin, hand full of hair, look in my eyes
Time to make the bed rock, baby look how it rise
Me and you movin in the nude, do it in the living room
Sweatin up the sheets, it's the Thug in me
I mean no disrespectin when I tongue kiss your neck
I go a long way to get you wet, what you expect
Late night, hit the highway, drop the top
I pull over, gettin busy in the parking lot
And don't you love it how I lick your, hips and glide
Kiss you soft on your stomach, push my love inside
Got ya lost in a love zone, stuck in the lust
I got the bedroom shakin back-breakin when we're tossin it up


In this baby, I like the way it's goin down
When all that is around, slip slide ride
Givin me love nice like
Female I like, what I wanna give all night
You and me alone everybody's gone toss it up
Baby let's, get it on!
I like the way you please me, babe
The sexy way you tease me, sugar

It really drives me crazy
Your body hypnotizing, your smell is so exciting
So baby come on home with me, I like the way you give it to me!




Ohhh, it's K-Ci baby, mmm that want you lady
Ohhh, don't act so shady, baby your taste as fine as gravy
The way you move that thang, you make me wanna sang

Big booty to the lung delight-ah
Bag it up yo, let me in there
Toss it up for me!!


Do you want me what's your phone number, I get around
Cali Love to my true Thugs, picture me now
Still down for that Death Row sound, searchin for paydays
No longer Dre Day, arrivederci
Blown and forgotten, rotten for plottin Child's Play
Check your sexuality, as fruity as this Alize
Quick to jump ship, punk trick, what a dumb move
Cross Death Row, now who you gon' run to?
Lookin for suckers cause you similar
Pretendin to be hard, oh my God, check your temperature
Screamin Compton, but you can't return, you ain't heard
Brothers pissed cause you switched and escaped to the burbs
Mob on to this new era, cause we Untouchable
Still can't believe that you got 'Pac rushin you
Up in you, bless the real, all the rest get killed
Who can you trust, only time reveals -- toss it up!


Play on playa, play on
How can some non-players do a song about Compton
and then wanna do a player song?
How can non-players do it? (We not little kids, we not playin)
Tellin lies, who?
Puffy, I read your little interview buddy, c'mon
You still ain't touchin us, all that peace talk
I don't care if you kiss my ass from here to across the street boy
It's on
Toss it up, we took you on, and we took y'all beat
You know we beat you down, and we took y'all beat
Cause you wasn't rockin it right
Tired of suckers rockin it, toss it up, is how we did it
Yeah, toss it up now!

 





No doubt... to live and die in LA
California -- what you say about Los Angeles
Still the only place for me that never rains in the sun
and everybody got love



To live and die in LA, where everyday we try to fatten our pockets
Us niggaz hustle for the cash so it's hard to knok it
Everybody got they own thang, currency chasin
Worldwide through the hard times, warrior faces
Shed tears as we bury niggaz close to heart
What was a friend now a ghost in the dark, cold hearted bout it
Nigga got smoked by a fiend, tryin to floss on him
Blind to a broken man's dream, a hard lesson
Court cases keep me guessin, plea bargain
ain't an option now, so I'm stressin, cost me more
to be free than a life in the pen
Makin money off of cuss words, writin again
Learn how to think ahead, so I fight with my pen
Late night down Sunset likin the scene
What's the worst they could do to a nigga got me lost in hell
To live and die in LA on bail, my angel sing



To live and die in LA, it's the place to be
You've got to be there to know it, what everybody wanna see


It's the, City of Angels and constant danger
South Central LA, can't get no stranger
Full of drama like a soap opera, on the curb
Watchin the ghetto bird helicopters, I observe
So many niggaz gettin three strikes, tossed in jail
I swear the pen the right across from hell, I can't cry
Cause it's on now, I'm just a nigga on his own now
Livin life Thug style, so I can't smile
Writin to my peoples when they ask for pictures
Thinkin Cali just fun and bitches, hahaha
Better learn about the dress code, B's and C's
All them other niggaz copycats, these is G's
I love Cali like I love woman
Cause every nigga in LA got a little bit of Thug in him
We might fight with each other, but I promise you this
We'll burn this bitch down, get us pissed
To live and die in LA
(Let my angel sing)



Cause would it be LA without Mexicans?
Black love brown pride and the sets again
Pete Wilson tryin to see us all broke, I'm on some bullshit
Out for everything they owe, remember K-DAY
Weekends, Crenshaw -- MLK
Automatics rang free, niggaz lost they way
Gang signs being showed, nigga love your hood
But reconize and it's all good, where the weed at?
Niggaz gettin shermed out
Snoop Dogg in this muhfucka perved out, M.O.B.
Big Suge in the Low-Low, bounce and turn
Dogg Pound in the Lex, wit a ounce to burn
Got them Watts niggaz with me, OFTB
They got some hash took the stash left the rest for me
Neckbone, Tre, Head Ron, Punchy too
Big Rock got knocked, but this one's for you
I hit the studio and drop a jewel, hopin it pay
Gettin high watchin time fly, to live and die in LA
(Let my angel sing)



This go out for 92.3, and 106
All the radio stations that be bumpin my shit
Makin my shit sells katruple quitraple platinum, hehe
This go out to all the magazines that supported me
All the real motherfuckers
All the stores, the mom and pop spots
A&R people, all y'all motherfuckers
LA, California Love part motherfuckin Two
Without gay ass Dre


God has a plan -- and the bible unfolds that wonderful plan
through the message of prophecy
God sent Jesus into this world to be our saviour
And that Christ is returning, someday soon
to unfold the wonderful plan of eternity, for my life and your life
As long as we're cooperating with God
by accepting Jesus Christ as our personal Lord and saviour
And as the Lord does return in the coming seven days
We'll see you next time here on This Week in Bible Prophecy


Tupac don't start that blasphemy in here!
Makaveli, the new breed -- and I remember what my pops told me
The new word, follow me -- remember what my pops told me

My family tree, consists of drug dealers, thugs and killers
Strugglin, known to hustle screamin fuck they feelings
I got advice from my father, all he told me was this
Niggaz, get off your ass if you plan to be rich
There's ten rules to the game, but I'll share with you two
Know, niggaz gon' hate you for whatever you do
Now rule one -- get your cash on, M.O.B.
That's Money Over Bitches, cause they breed envy
Now rule two is a hard one, watch for phonies
Keep yo', enemies close nigga, watch yo' homies
It seemed a little unimportant, when he told me I smiled
Picture jewels being handed, to an innocent child
I never knew in my lifetime I'd live by these rules
Initiated as an outlaw, studying rules
Now papa ain't around, so I gotta recall
or come to grips with bein on my enemy's wall (rest in peace)
Promised if I have a seed, I'ma guide him right
Dear Lord don't let me die tonite
I got words for my comrades, listen and learn
Ain't nuttin free, give back what you earn, no doubt
Gettin higher than a motherfucker, blessed and pleased
This Thug Life'll be the death of me, c'mon, yeah

And I remember what my papa told me
Remember what my papa told me, blasphemy



Love for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord
Dem a tell nuff lie but holdin my bird in a cloud
Usin de name of de Lord in vein
While de people in de ghetto, feel nuff pain


We probably in Hell already, our dumb asses not knowin
Everybody kissin ass to go to heaven ain't goin
Put my soul on it, I'm fightin devil niggaz daily
Plus the media be crucifying brothers severly
Tell me I ain't God's son, nigga mom a virgin
We got addicted had to leave the burbs, back in the ghetto
doin wild shit, lookin at the sun don't pay
Criminal mind all the time, wait for Judgment Day
They say Moses split the Red Sea
I split the blunt and rolled the fat one, I'm deadly -- Babylon beware
Comin from the Pharoahe's kids, retaliation
Makin legends off the shit we did, still bullshittin
Niggaz in Jerusalem, waitin for signs
God promised, she's just takin her time, haha
Living by the Nile while the water flows
I'm contemplating plots wondering which door to go
Brothas getting shot, comin back resurrected
It's just that raw shit, nigga check it (that raw shit)

And I remember what my papa told me
Remember what my papa told me, blasphemy


The preacher want me buried why? Cause I know he a liar
Have you ever seen a crackhead, that's eternal fire
Why you got these kids minds, thinkin that they evil
while the preacher bein richer you say honor God's people
Should we cry, when the Pope die, my request
We should cry if they cried when we buried Malcolm X
Mama tell me am I wrong, is God just another cop
waitin to beat my ass if I don't go pop?
Memories of a past time, givin up cash
to the leaders, knowin damn well, it ain't gonna feed us
In my brain how can you explain, time in D.C.
It's hard enough to live now, in these times of greed
They say Jesus is a kind man, well he should understand
times in this crime man, my Thug nation
Do whatchu gotta do but know you gotta change
Try to find a way to make it out the game
I leave this and hope God can see my heart is pure
Is heaven just another door? I leave this here
I leave this and hope God see my heart is pure
Is heaven just another door? And my people say



Our father, who art in heaven
Hallow be thy name
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
In earth, as it is in heaven
Give us this day, our daily bread
As we give up our debts
As we forgive our debt-ors
Lead us not into temptation
but deliver us, unevil
For God, is the kingdom, and the power
and the glory forever, and ever, and ever

 

Life Of An Outlaw

In the life we live as thugs,
Everbody fuckin wit us so can't you see
It's hard to be a man.
Ridin wit my gun in hand.

Why explain the game? Niggas ain't listenin.
Stuck in positions. If victims can't stand the heat,
Then stay the fuck out the kitchen.
Have these bustas switchin, lookin at me mean.
Itchin, givin suckas plenty space.
Have these bitch niggas snitchin.
Where are we now? Guns found daily.
The feds surely hope that they could finally nail me for sellin dope.
They backwards, make tracks burst whenever I rap.
Attack. Words bein known to explode on contact.
Extreme at times. Blinded by my passion and fury.
Look at me laugh at my competition's flashin my jewelry.
You'd stay silent if you niggas knew me. Truely effective.
The shit you heard ain't do me justice. Got a death wish, bitch.
Run up, face me and trace wit an infared beam.
It seems niggas ain't recognize my team.
Ain't nobody holdin you back. Explode the track to confetti.
Unload it. Cuz niggas ain't ready. The life of an outlaw.



Code 3. Attack formation. Pull out your pistols.
Keep an eye out for the devils cuz they itchin to get you.
Mercy to this madman screamin kamikaze in tongue.
Automatic gunfire makin all my enemies run.
Who should I call when I'm shot and bleedin.
Indeed the possibility has part a chase in cream.
Dope got me hatin fiends. Scheam wit my team, just a chosen few.
My foes victim of explosives. Come closer. Exhale the fumes.
We got memories fadin fast. A slave for cash.
Accelerate, mash, blast, then dash.
Don't look now. How you like it, raw.
Niggas ain't ready for the wrath of the outlaws. Never surrender.
Death is for a son to stay free. I'm thugged out.
Fuck the world cuz this is how they made me.
Scarred but still breathin.
Believe in me and you could see the victory.
A warrior with jewels. Can you picture me?
Life of and outlaw.


City under siege. It's like I can't even breathe.
I'm from the state of car theives. G, deep from the street.
Plenty beef. I play for keeps, arrange the whole crime scene.
Mobb Deep. This nigga from behind tryin to creep.
No halfs wit no straps, jack.
It's on to bounce back.
And an ounce so fat, they snatch my style ?
Get this grip wit hollows to get cha.
Snip wit clippers. Get the picture?
I wrote my life down like a scripture.

And I'm still on lost in the land of the lonely.
Where ain't nobody holy. A matter of a fact, we unholy.
Everybody livin soley for themselves. Too hostile on a land hell.
Somebody need me. You know we lost hope and we needin it.
Wit the evil it's forever. But it might be low down, scandalouz
Like a tramp is. All for the street fame on how to be managed.
To plan shit. 6 months in advaced to what we plotted.
Approved to go on swole and now I got it.

Un uh, crack my window. Knowin they'd love to catch Kastro sleepin.
Attach a strap under my pillow and a hand like we freakin.
Creepin deep into morning. Peepin out the weak.
While they yawnin and let my cloud speak for it's self.
No doubt. Outlaw. Outta my mind, outta time. You're all blind.
Some kind of life of mine Kato don't mind.
Findin it funny, matter of fact, cuz it is.
Perhaps finally I look at that true over the years as an outlaw.
Eh, Noble.
What's up nigga.
Would you die for me, nigga?
Hell yeah.
Would you kill for me?
On my grandmother, nigga.
Ah yo.
What's up.
Let's ride on them stupid bitches right now.
Watch out.

Well now they all say they roaches and parasites.
Snakes and all they might
Thug Life break night.
Drink till we fist fight.
Life or death. But you can't win with a vest.
But there won't be no breathing for the reason
Punk bitch on your breath.
I see day is dark and I admit it's dark.
So chase ?
Beware foolin marks.
And yo, Makaveli, give me them bullets that was left for PO's belly.
And let me bust back to them niggas till they all sweaty.








Open Fire

"Alright now, here we go"



Tell me, how many real motherfuckers feel me? I smoke a blunt
and freak the funk until these jealous motherfuckers kill me
I'm out the gutter, pick a hero
I'm 165 and staying high til I die, my competion's zero
Cause I could give a fuck about you, better duck
Or I'll be forced to hit yo ass up I give a fuck
I'm sick inside my mind, why you sweatin me?
It's gonna take an army full of crooked ass cops to come and get me
Niggaz know I ain't the one to sleep on, I'm under pressure
Gotta sleep with my piece, an extra clip beside my dresser
Word to God I've been ready to die since I was born
I don't want no shit but niggaz trip and yo it's on
Open fire on my adversaries, don't even worry
Better have on a vest aim for the chest and then you buried
It's a man's world, niggaz get played, another stray
Hope I live to see another day, hey
I'm getting sweated by these undercovers, who can I trust?
Got my mama stressin thinkin it's a drug bust
Gotta get paid but all the drama that's attached
We living a Drug Life, Thug Life, each day could be my last
Will I blast when it's time to shoot? Don't even ask
That's the consequences when ya livin, fast
Six bricks of tricks, for my niggaz, I gotta come up
and recoup, you keep the dope just bring me six figures
Is it a bust? I hear the sirens, run for cover
over the fence and open fire

"Alright now, here we go"



These motherfuckers on my ass I'm in traffic, will it be tragic?
I'm comin round the corner like I'm Magic
Doin ninety on the freeway, and hittin switches
In a high speed chase with these punk bitches
Don't turn around I ain't givin up, cause they don't worry me
Pussy ass bitches better bury me
Runnin outta gas time to park it, I'm on foot
We in the hood, how the fuck they gon catch a crook? Haha
I got away cause I'm clever
Went to my neighbors for a favor now you know players stick together
I watch the scene from the rooftop, spittin loogies
at the coppers that persue me, beotch!
I be a hustler til it's over, motherfucker
Open fire on you bustas

"Alright now, here we go"



Don't try to follow me, I'm headed outta state
I gotta pay my fuckin bills, so I'm transportin weight
Change my plates, pick up my nigga, and now we rollin
Droppin keys like they stolen, hehe
Tell me who do you fear? I'm outta town until the coast is clear
Enough dope to last a year
They got me running from the police, nowhere to go
With the lights out, rollin down a dirt road
But I ain't goin alive, I'd rather die than be a convict
I'd rather fire on my target
I hit the corner doing ninety, ahhhh shit!
Them bitches right behind me
They take a shot and hit my fuckin tires
Now, jump out the car then I open fire, sucka!

Hahahaha, Thug Life!




Now up and at em it's on, I was raised to be strong
And Mama told me be a Thug since the day I was born
I came up, out the gutter never changed my style
Got for real about my papers, cause the game was wild
And the fame was a plot to try to change me
And what's strange is nobody knew my name 'fore it came
Now the whole world is calling me a, killer
All I ever did, was try to reach the kids with the real
All the time I was ballin, never heard my friends callin
Couldn't stop myself from fallin, I'm all in
Shit's gettin sleazy, believe me
Best to take what ya need, but don't be greedy
Cause in my mind, I see sunshine, I thought
I didn't have to run, now I'm duckin from the gun yellin, 'One-Time'
Take your time to feel my record, and if you did
chill a second, my blind method, will still wreck it
My young homies stay strong
I wonder if they'll listen to a nigga when he gone, R U Still Down?



I'm gettin high, so a nigga think he touch the sky
Turn tough inside, in the rush to die
Livin life as a Thug time to face the truth
What's goin on with the wasted youth, please God
come and save me (save me), had to work with what ya gave me
And got a nigga goin crazy
I can't read the signs, I'm blind, but a nigga know
he need his nine, cause times, they ain't what they used to be
Ain't a penitentiary built big enough for me
and my niggaz on the streets, man listen
Cause these ain't the old days
Ain't no way I'ma bustin my ass and gettin no pay
It seems I can't find my focus, and homey I ain't paranoid
I seen the future and it's hopeless
Lord knows, its hard on a young scrub
It seems I had less problems when I slung drugs
But since I'm tryin lace niggaz with the game
wanna see me locked in chains, tryin to dirty up my name
And them same motherfuckers that was callin me
Will be the first to turn their backs, when I'm fallin, see
I should have seen it from the jump, but now it's clear
This one nigga got the town in fear, but R U Still Down


I wrote this for my critics and my, enemies
Last year ya used to love me, huh REMEMBER ME
Now ya hate me with a passion, tryin to get me stuck in the mix
I'm stayin sharp, got no time for them tricks
And now they wonder if I'm goin to jail
Just as well, cause my life on the streets - a living Hell
And I can't sleep, they got my phone tapped, and mercy Lord
Come get me 'fore they hurt me
Ran outta tears, and through the years couldn't change me
My daddy left me alone, and so I'm angry
I never did nothin wrong, my mama told me, "Baby it's on"
And now I'm hustlin and bustlin bones
Never said it came easy, I'm makin cheese
Buyin all the things on TV, and gettin skeezed
Wish my homeboys could see me now
Little bad motherfucker runnin wild through the town
Please tell me, R U Still Down?

R U Still Down, to raise em up? Remember me [repeat 2X]
R U Still Down, to raise em up?

R U Still Down, to raise em up? Remember me [repeat 3X]
R U Still Down, to raise em up?

R U Still Down, to raise em up? Remember me [repeat 3X]
R U Still Down, to raise em up?

That's right y'all, give them bitches the motherfuckin middle finger
RAISSSSE em up
These hoes can't fade me, don't these bitches know we crazy?
Thug Life, niggaz, be, the sickest
You feel me? Now get that shit written down
God damn!
Took four years and a motherfuckin case for these motherfuckers to feel me
Ain't that a bitch?

R U Still motherfucking down?
Old hoe ass fake ass niggaz
We out this motherfucker


Hellrazor


Major! Hell motherfuckin yeah
This one goes out to my nigga Mike Coolin, hell yeah
Mama raised a hellrazor... born thuggin
Heartless and mean, muggin at sixteen
On the scene watchin fiends buggin
Kickin up dust with the older G's
Soakin up the game that was told to me
I ain't never touched a gat that I couldn't shoot, I learned
not to trust the bitch from the prostitutes, was taught lessons
A young nigga askin questions while other suckers was guessin
I was ganked for sexin
Elementary wasn't meant for me, can't regret it
I'm headed for the penitentiary, I'm cuttin class
and I'm buckin blastin, straight mashin
Mobbin through the overpass laughin
While these other motherfuckers try to figure out, no doubt
They jealous of a nigga's clout, tell me Lord
Can ya feel me? I keep my finger in the trigger
Cause some nigga tried to kill me
and mama raised a hellraizor, everyday gettin paid
Police on my pager, straight stressin
A fugitive my occupation is under question
Wanted for investigation, and even though
I'm marked for death, I'ma spark til I lose my breath
Motherfuckers, every time I see the paper
I see my picture, when a nigga's gettin richer
They come to get ya, it's like a motherfuckin trap
And they wonder why it's hard bein black
Dear Lord can ya feel me, gettin major, unhh



Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin major
Lord be my savior, unnh

Mama raised a hellrazor
[2Pac] Dear Lord can ya feel me
Stress gettin major, unnh
Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin major

Damn near running outta time, everybody's dyin
Mama raised a hellrazor, can't figure
Why you let the police beat down niggaz
I'm startin to think all the rich in the world is safe
While the po' babies restin in the early graves
God come save the youth
Ain't nothin else to do but have faith in you
Dear Lord I live the life of a Thug, hope you understand
Forgive me for my mistakes, I gotta play my hand
And my hand's on the sixteen-shot, semi-automatic
crooked cop killin Glock, tell me Lord
Can ya feel me? Show a way
I'm prayin but my enemies won't go away
And everywhere I turn I see niggaz burn
Every nigga that I know's on death row
My younger homie's seventeen and he paid a price
Little young motherfucker doin triple life
Though I tell him in his letters, it's gettin better
If my nigga knew the truth he'd hit the roof
Just heard ya baby's mama was smoked out, fuck the drama
Wanna break my Loc out, smokin blunts
Gettin drunk off that Tanqueray gin
Bout to break my nigga out the fuckin pen
Mama raised a hellrazor, uhh, yeah
C'mon, uhh, mama raised a hellrazor
Uhh, dear Lord can ya feel me, stress gettin major
(Lord be my savior, unnh)



Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin major
Lord be my savior, unhh

Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin major

Dear Lord can ya hear me, it's just me
A young nigga tryin to make it on these rough streets
I'm on my knees beggin please come and SAVE ME

Everybody run for cover, I cause shit
Thug Life motherfucker, duck quick
Now am I wrong if I am don't worry me
Cause do or die gettin high til the bury me
Dear Lord if ya hear me, tell me why
Little girl like LaTasha, had to die
She never got to see the bullet, just heard the shot
Her little body couldn't take it, it shook and dropped
And when I saw it on the news I see busta girl killin 'Tasha
Now I'm screamin fuck the world, in the end
it's my friends, that flip-flop
Lip-locked on my dick when my shit drop
Thug Life motherfucker I lick shots
Every nigga on my block dropped two cops
Dear Lord can ya hear me, when I die
Let a nigga be strapped, fucked up, and high
with my hands on the trugger, Thug nigga
Stressin like a motherfuckin drug dealer
And even in the darkest nights, I'm a Thug for Life
I got the heart to fight now
Mama raised a hellraiser why cry
That's just life in the ghetto, do or die

You feel me, things that we can only do as a real G
We ain't dead yet, feel me!!



I got my Hennessy find ya foes
in a room full of niggas tryin' to hide ya hoes
I'm getting high off buddha
'Cause the times be slow
I keep my mind on dough
you never find me broke
and who meee a nigga livin' life like a G
in that artillery keepin' niggas off of me
I can't sleep living in these wicked times
peep, niggas after me 'cause they see I'm stacking G's and heat
You can holler if you want to pleeease
I ain't runnin' with no punk crew beeee
enemies and my range is on
you're in the danger zone
my fuckin' game is strong, Hotline
You suckas better find ya mind I got mine
from hustling and busting them rhymes
to my niggas up in Quentin
Down on Riker's Isle stay rile
But a nigga gotta use his styles
These,



Niggas don't know my style
quick to smile juvenile
Was a problem child
try to put me in the courts
But my force was wild
Bitchmade ass niggas don't know my style
These,
Niggas don't know my style
quick to smile juvenile
Was a problem child
try to put me in the courts
But my force was wild
Bitchmade ass niggas don't know my style



I could be wrong but I never got along with cops
it's like they stuck
from making niggas duck from Glocks all the time
my mind's full of thoughts of ends
I'm still rolling my bucket but I bought me a Benz (tadow)
My fake friends say they love me but I know they lie
cause in the dark see they hearts' full of homicide
My mama cried when they took me off to jail
only me inside the cell
Straight locked up in this hell
I hear some sucka screaming like the demon's inside
will 'em away in the morning
Only the strong survive
I cry but in my own way
Swallow my pride pick a reason to hide
from all the niggas that die (Rest in Peace)
cemetary full of brothers I buried
It's going down even now I wonder
will I still be around my hometown is the gutter
I was born a wild came up out this dust
with my heartless style
These,



I remember Uptown huh got to get to listenin'
to Mr. Magic cuttin' up the hits
and even though I had habit makin' words rhyme
I was caught up in the madness
Juvenile thugs come on
I tell the whole story nothin' but truth
Halloween throwin' eggs from the project roofs
and Pete and Lee young G's
with a gift of gab and tryin' to hook up with the hookers
who was quick to stab remember mama's cooking
No school straight hookin'
and tryin' to get with light skinned
cause she good looking
And jumpin' over turnstiles 'cause we ain't paying
call the cuties cuss words but we only playing (biotch)
I'm prayin' I can get a buck no luck
I had to move around a lot
'cause my moms was stuck
I had family but I was way too wild
had to move to the West to regain my style
These,




Where Do We Go From Here (interlude)

Power.. pow.. power...

Guess who's back? Hahaha, here we go
It's ninety-fo', what's next?

Power.. enter my world

I guess this year gonna be a motherfucker for real niggaz
I swear these playa haters done got a taste of power
It ain't all good in the hood
Least not on my side, from where I stand
And the law? Man, fuck the law!
Niggaz must outthink, outstep, and continuously outsmart
the motherfuckin law, in every way
Key word in ninety-four is 'down low'
Gots to be struggling
I see how the rich got theirs
Nigga I'm legit, shit
Where do we go from here?
(Who's afraid, of the punk police?
To my niggaz run the streets, fuck peace) -- [repeat in background]
Heyyy niggaz, where your heart at?
See motherfuckers killin babies, killin mommas
Killin kids, puttin this in they motherfuckin mark
Now what type of mixed up trick would kill the future of our race
before he would he look his enemy dead in the eye, and open fire?
These crazy motherfuckers got toys with guns
Jails for guns, but still, no god damn jobs
And they wonder why we loc'n up
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go?
[singers singing variations of 'Where do we go from here']
All you niggaz out there
The clouds shook, the world listened
We stood together in April of ninety-two
With duty, and a sense of honor
There is no limit to what WE can achieve
That's all on us... us...
Not my niggaz, not the whites, not the enemies
or none of them motherfuckers, US
What can WE do? Shit
I declare a death sentence to all child molestors
Fake-ass bitches, male and female
And all you punk-ass snitches
We can do without your asshole
Let no man break, what we set
Where do we go from here?

Rest in peace, to Cato, I miss you
All the other real G's that passed away in ninety-three
In ninety-four, and more
What do we do? For us?




 

There's no way to survive in the city it's a shame
Niggaz die from my hollow-point bullet to the brain
Will I survive or will I die is what I wonder
Puffin on blunts and gettin drunk to keep from goin under
Gettin lost in the madness, blunted gettin tipsy
Got my pistol out the window screamin, "Lord come and get me"
Am I sick, or am I just another victim?
Unloadin my clip, I'm watchin every bullet spit when I kick em
Niggaz die from automatic gunfire
Your time to expire, nobody cry every man gotta die
When they bury me, they bury me a G
Rest in peace, to all the homies got to heaven before me
Pour some liquor on the curb for the niggaz that's caught
Had a motherfuckin ward but he didn't go to court
God damn, and one day we'll all be together
Until then I'm ready for whatever, c'mon

(Yeah, niggaz movin somethin in the nine-trey
It's all about makin money, gettin yours
And knockin coppers off the motherfuckin planet
Word to the motherfuckin nine nigga
We gonna make this motherfucker ours
If they don't feel me, they gon kill me
So Syke, get skanless nigga)


Am I going to Hell or will I reach Heav-en? (hell naw)
After all this shit I did with my Mac-11
Did I sell my soul? Mama woulda saved me
That's the way that daddy raised me
Oh God, help me I'm losin it
So fuck it! Take me I'm doin it!
I need to change and look for a better way
I got a hundred round clip to my AK
Commitin sins I might die in vain
So fuck it! We'll live off the street fame!
God didn't send me in the right direction
I'm gettin hit by a diesel in the intersection
I know you're out there help a young brother (hear me)
Til then I'ma smoke motherfuckers
Things wouldn't be so bad
if we got the things that we never had, I'm ready for whatever

(Hahahahaha, that's my motherfuckin nigga there
Big ballin-ass Syke
Yeah nigga, you schooled them young bustas
on how it is to be a real motherfuckin G
In the nine-trey motherfuckers is dyin daily so you best be packin
If you ain't, boo-yaow motherfucker!)


Dear mama I know you worry cause I'm hardly at home
Every other night in jail, got you patient by the phone
Wanna shake it cause I can't take it got me livin in Hell
Like I'm walkin with a secret that'll kill me if I tell
I live the Thug Life and can't nobody, change me
Not to the brain, going insane, just a part of the game
So much caine in the fast lane, finally a dry eye
When I die, bury me with my fo'-five
And let the devil feel the wrath of a nigga
Goin to Hell with my finger on the trigger
Now everybody's starin
Got a nigga losin hair and they wonder if I'm all there
Well don't blame me, blame the flame that flickers
when niggaz gettin richer (mo' money)
Now tell me if you wanna live forever
Niggaz dyin so be ready for whatever

(Yeah, ready for whatever
Ready for whatever
Thug Life niggaz and we be ready for whatever
Let me go like this, ready for whatever
Huh, Big Syke he be ready for whatever

Yeah, ready for whatever
Ready for whatever
My big-ballin ass nigga Boom, ready for whatever fo' sho'
Yeah, you know!

I know you standin there confused
You wonderin -- what type of nigga is a Thug Life nigga?
Yeahehehehe nigga, we be the ballin player-ass nigga
About gettin riches, bitches, and plenty loc
Ya hear me?)

Ready for whatever

 

Them bitches is foul, take a look at the evening news
You'll see a nigga gettin cuffed by the boys in blue
Is it a, frame up, tryin to keep me out the game, stuck
These motherfuckers tryin to dirty up my name, but
I'm slippin quick as the wind, it's me or them
Fuck friends my foes be on a mission tryin to do me in
Fuck 'em I'm bout to get out, they all soft
I blow up like gauge, and in a rage blow they balls off
Why are you niggaz tryin to test me trick?
And be the first ones to snitch to arrest me bitch
Main thang was to make a nigga meal ticket
Only if you with the real, the nigga will kick it
I'll enforce it with the steel use the lessons that I learned in jail
Rule one: fuck a busta he can burn in Hell
Network with connects that I got in the pen
In no time I'll be clockin again


Still sittin in my cell as I dwell on my past
Tryin to figure how a nigga turned dreams into cash
Quick call her collect, ain't no respect on the other side
My cellmate's suicidal cause his mother died
And my C.O. is a lady, and I'm thinkin maybe
me and her can hook up a scheme, to be Swayze
Cause she keep on callin me baby
To a young motherfucker facin eighty that's enough to make you crazy
Now how long will it take, to get her hooked
Got her watchin me liftin weights, sneakin looks
I devised a plan, I'm in the trunk while she drives the van
Ain't no disguise I'ma die as a man
If we make it then I'm takin it to Hell
All them niggaz that was frontin while I sat up in the cell
Locked in jail, I couldn't touch her so I planned your misery
The nigga you don't wanna see


Stuck in my cell
The pen ain't nuttin like the county jail
When will they let me bail?
Walkin through the yard, I play the God
First nigga disrespect me first nigga gettin scarred
I'm, back on the scene
I'm hittin knees in the back of a limousine, puffin on weed
as we game on the drunk hoes
Hit the skunk I reminisce just on the way
we used to play, you punk hoes
What I posess is to be rich, in currency
Paranoid niggaz like bitches when they come and see me
Laid out, played out, the nigga barely breathin
As for that bullshit punk, nigga n-now we even
But I wait, until it's time
and try to find a crooked way to profit off this crime
This life of mine.. until I get free
My prophecy is niggaz screamin, as if they bleed in agony
As soon as they popped my gate
I knew these motherfuckers made a mistake


When I get free
Hahaha.. yeah nigga, when I get motherfuckin free
Pop the gate, I'm back baby!
When I get free.. we up out this bitch

 

Hold On Be Strong

Hold on... [lighter flicks up]
Yeah it's gonna be alright, don't trip baby [inhales]
It'll get better... [coughing]

Ay do this Thug style main, Thug style
When this whole beat drop we just gon' run it to em bet
It's all good, uhh

I never had much, ran with a bad bunch
Little skinny kid sneakin weed in my bag lunch
And all through Junior High, we was just gettin by
And drivebys robbed my homies of their young lives
I never did cry, and even though I had
pain in my heart, I was hopeless from the start
They couldn't tell me nothin, they all tried to help to help me
The marijuana had my mind gone it wasn't healthy
I travelled places, caught cases, what a ill year
I felt the pain and the rain but I'm still here
Never did like the police, let the whole world know
Now I gets no peace, cause they chasin me down
And facin me now, what do I do?
These thangs that a Thug goes through
And still I rise so keep ya head up, and make ya mind strong
It's a struggle every day but you gotta hold on



Hold on, be strong, hold on
Be strong, hold on
When it's on it's on

There's, never a good day, cause in my hood they
let they AK's pump strays where the kids play
And every Halloween, check out the murder scene
Can't help but duplicate the violence seen on the screen
My homies dyin 'fore they get to see they birthdays
These is the worst days, sometimes it hurts to pray
And even God turned his back on the ghetto youth
I know that ain't the truth, sometimes I look for proof
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto, and if it does
Does it matter if you blood or you cuz
Remember how it was, the picnics and the parties in the projects
Small time drinkin gettin high with them armies
Just another knucklehead kid from the gutter
I'm dealin with the madness, raised by a single mother
I'm tryin to tell you when it's on
You gotta keep your head to the sky and be strong, most of all hold on



Hold on, be strong
I know them ain't tears comin down your face
When it's on it's on but
Wipe your eyes
Hold on, be strong
In this world
When it's on it's on but
Only the strong survive y'know
Hold on, be strong
Hmm, I know it's hard out there
When it's on it's on but
Welfare
Hold on, be strong
AIDS, earthquakes
Cause when it's on it's on but
Muggings, carjackings
Hold on, and be strong
Yeah we got problems
Cause when it's on it's on but
But believe me when I tell you
Hold on, and be strong
Things always get better
Cause when it's on it's on but
God don't like ugly
Hold on, and be strong
And God don't like no quitters
Cause when it's on it's on but
You know what Billie Holiday said bay-bee
Hold on, and be strong
God bless the child that can hold his own
Cause when it's on it's on but
Y'know?
Hold on, and be strong
You got to stand strong
Cause when it's on it's on but
And when these bustas try to knock you out your place
Hold on, and be strong
You stand there to they face
Cause when it's on it's on but
Tell em hold on, and be strong
Hold on, and be strong
The game don't stop
Cause when it's on it's on but
Hmmm
Hold on, and be strong
This here is black main
Cause when it's on it's on but
If you don't never leave nothin, learn one thing
Hold on, and be strong
It don't stop, til the casket drop
Hold on
Thug, for Life... feel me?
All my homeboys and my homegirls, stay strong
When things get bad, especially come the first and the fifteenth
Stay strong, and stay ballin, hold on
I'll catch y'all at the next life, we in traffic


I'm Losin It


Straight out the motherfucking bay
Here we go


Lord help me, save me, Mama keep praying
For a young motherfucker trying to duck an early grave
In the city where ya can't tell the snakes from the fakes
Fakes from the phonies, enemies of homies
Around the corner there's another nigga waiting to jack
He don't know I got a glock 'til his ass get shot
Like a motherfucking thug disease
Craving beats like they motherfucking drugs to me, hey
What's up with bitches trying to screw me? Do me cause I did a movie
Throw the pussy to me but before they never knew me
Rather die then let ya play me for a, buster
And with my glock I'm a plotting ass rotten motherfucker, huh
Don't let the movie fool ya, let me school ya
Screaming Thug Life nigga when I do ya
I'm going crazy, getting dizzy
And then I suffacate a motherfucking breather bring me back
I'm telling ya I'm losing it


Said I'm losing my mind
Losing my mind

I'm going crazy, niggas can't fade me
On the real I kill when I step to ya fucking grill
So let me kick it let me flip it let me get wicked
I'm not a buster from the hood selling whooped tickets
I hang with G's flipping keys and smoking weed
I get the cash and dash and never learn to read
So fuck a bitch fuck a hoe and I let ya know
Because they come and go like the wind blows
What am I giving how I'm living what I'm giving up
You can take my life and I don't give a fuck
Cause I'm the trouble most coming from the west coast
Where the niggas is banging 'til the overdose
Killers and murderers, psychos and lunatics
Nobody knows what makes my mind click
Is it the demons, screaming inside of me?
Hell no it's just the Thug Life mentallity
I'm going crazy shit don't phase me
I'm living like a thug 'til six niggas carry me
Death is on the trigga so pull it
I can't take it no more, nigga, I'm losing it


Shit was talking to me, my gat screamed fire
The bullet told me shoot that motherfucker he's a lier
I talked to me 3-80 like a bitch on a stroll
When my niggas try to ????
Nigga, I can't get fucked in this game I'm a psychopath
My AK told me to shove him up some niggas ass
I'm having long conversations with Mr. Millometer
He's one of my best friends bitch ass nigga eater
And Miss Mossburg love it in the back trunk
You know that old school bitch she like to get it funked
And spitting motherfuckers by the seems
My grand daddy Mr. AR-15
By the evil motherfucker
Talked me into taking over a dope turf and shooting cluckers
Said he was my only family
Shoot straight, and please don't jam me
Got in a fight at the club my gat started talking
Told me to shut the fuck up and let him do the talking
I woke up and it was sick to see the guts hang
I'm going nuts man
Shit was talking to me


Look here little nigga
Most of these niggaz be bitches too
but you'll never hear that side of the story
So uhh, we finna do this shit like this

They love to G a nigga young dumb and gettin riches
What the fuck you think a trick is nigga
Nigga done stick and wet his dick
and then get tricked out all his riches by a -- BITCH!
I'm here to school you to the rules of the game, it'll cost ya
Think you alla that just cause she let a nigga toss her
It's like a motherfuckin priveledge
So don't give up your conversation, give that bitch your 7 digits
When she call ya, ask that tramp whassup
And if she hesitate, nigga hang up, worrrd up
And let that bitch meditate to the dial tone
And call me when you're ready to bone, and it's on
A motherfucking mack tonight
Stay that stay strapped cause my raps is tight
You fuckin punks, I hate you snitches
Went against the grain and the game to be fake ass bitches

(God, damn! You can't just hit them niggaz with that game
and expect them to accept it; girl your heard me it gets skanless.
But we gonna kick this shit like this here)



I can't stand fake ass bitches
Lyin ass niggaz and you punk ass snitches

Run up on a real motherfucker and get tossed
The game is deep, and thicker than a motherfuckin jimmy
Broke hoes runnin round yellin "Gimme!"

Shit all I wanted her to do is suck my DICK
So how about hittin a motherfucker on my pager
Busy now bitch but you can give me the pussy later

Fake ass motherfuckin bitch, die in ninety-four


Do For Love


Turn it up loud
Hahaha, ahahaha, hey man
You a little sucker for love, right?
Word up, hahahahaha

I shoulda seen
you was trouble right from the starrrrt, taught me so many
lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
we had some problems but we workin at it, and now
the arguments are gettin loud, I wanna say
But I can't help from walkin out just a little way
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be a man it just wasn't me
But now I'm searchin for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don't be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you're killin me with your jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free
I can't breathe, cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap
I hear you callin me to come back, I'm a sucka for love
that's right, sucka for love



What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up


Just when I thought I broke away and I'm fellin happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don't wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do? So
now I'm back
to makin promises to you, tryin to keep it true
What if I'm wrong, a trick to keep me on and on
Tryin to be strong and in the process, keep you goin
I'm bout to lose my composure, I'm gettin close
To packin up and leavin notes, and gettin ghost
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head I'm feelin low, losin control
My heart is sayin leave, oh what a tangle web we weave
when we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin calls at the house, guess you cheatin
That's all I need to hear cause I'm leavin, I'm out the do'
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
Cause now I know you've been cheatin, I'm a sucka for love
damn, sucka for love... sucka for love
sucka for love



Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still
stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings'll go away
It wasn't always a hit and run relationship
It use to be love, happieness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your
eyes
Preoccupied with gettin tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don't worry bout it we can do it now I'm under pressure
Make a decision cause I'm waitin, when I'm alone
I'm on the phone havin secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
but I need your faith in me, I'm a sucka for love
sucka for love, know you ain't right G but yet I'ma sucka for
love



I'ma sucka for love, sucka for love
Sucka for love




 

Letter to the President

Uhh.. dear Mr. President
Whas happenin?
I'm writin you because, s**t is still real f**ked up in my neighborhood
Pretty much the same way, right around the time when you got elected
Ain't nothin changed
All the promises you made, before you got elected..
.. they ain't came true


Tell me what to do, these ni**az actin up in the hood
Send mo' troops, dear Mr. President
(Me and my homies is wonderin what's goin on.. holla!)
Tell me what to do, these ni**az actin up in the hood
Send mo' troops..

Why should I lie, when I can dramatize?
ni**az fell victim to my lyrics, now traumatized
Simply by spittin I've been blessed given riches, enemies suspicious
cause I'm seldom in the company of bi**hes
Plus the concepts I depict, so visual, that you can kiss
each and every trick or bi**h, inside the s**t I kick
My heaviest verse'll move a mountain
Casualties in ma*s amounts, brothers keep countin
f**k the friendships, I ride alone
Destination Death Row, finally found a home
Plus all my homies wanna die, call it euthanasia
Dear Lord, look how sick this ghetto made us, sincerely
yours I'm a thug, the product of a broken home
Everybody's doped up, ni**a what you smokin on?
Figure if we high they can train us
but then America f**ked up and blamed up
I guess it's cause we black that we targets
My only fear is God, I spit that hard s**t
In case you don't know, I let my pump go
Get ?ride for M'Thulu? like I ride for Geronimo
Down to die, for everything I represent
Meant every word, in my letter to the President

Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These ni**az actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
(What should I do?)
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These ni**az actin up in the hood, send mo' troops


Oh youse a ball in the White House, I hope you comfortable
cause yo I spend my nights out, with the lights out
under the safety of darkness, amongst the crazed and the heartless
and young soul bros, ready to rode a starship
Launch it, leave a ni**a flat for scratch, the Godless
I gotta get chips, but you can't understand that
Wanna ban rap? Stand back, before you get hurt
It's the only thing makin pay besides smoke and work
On a mission listen more chips my goal and position
First on my decision I realized the same ni**a
Trippin to drastic measures tryin to get stacks of cheddar
Muh'f**kers hate cops, wait it ain't gettin better
But you keep, tellin us, that it is
while your motherf**kin troops keep killin our kids, dig
Don't be surprised if you see us
Dumpin with nuttin but artillery to free us, motherf**ker

Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These ni**az actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These ni**az actin up in the hood, send mo' troops


Strapped and angry, with no hope and heartbroke
Fightin first my trained brain until it's not so
It's hostile, ni**az lick shots to watch the glocks glow
Cadres of coppers patrol us like we some animals
And it ain't no peace, my peace a piece on my streets
to people beefin and things, squeakin on they beefs for weeks
Mr. President, it's evident, nobody really care
for a struggle out the gutter, twenty-two with gray hair
I was raised to raise hell, frail and my heart stale
So I'ma bring hell to earth until my heart fail
But y'all play fair, give me and mine, I'll share
Til y'all show us you care, it's gon' be mayhem out here
Me and these 223'sll freeze the biggest with ease
I'm still a ni**a you fear, bring the beast to his knees
and I've been born to represent, for that I've been heaven sent
And I meant, every word, in my letter, to the President

s**t is still f**ked up y'all
And y'all wonder when it's gon' get better
and it ain't gon' get better


Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These ni**az actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These ni**az actin up..

Heavenly Father may I holla at you briefly
I wanna meet the President, but will he meet me?
He's scared to look inside the eyes of a Thug ni**a
We tired of bein scapegoats for this capitalistic drug dealin
How hypocritical is Liberty?
That blind bi**h ain't never did s**t for me
My history, full of casket and scars
My own black nation at war, whole family behind bars
And they wonder why we scarred, thirteen lookin hard
Sister had a baby as an adolescent, where was God?
Somewhere in the middle of my mind
is a ni**a on the tightrope, screamin let him die
Can't lie I'm a thug, drownin in my own blood
Lookin for the reason that my momma's strung out on drugs
Down to die, for everything I represent
Meant every word, in my letter to the President


Blacks is broke, think it's a joke that we livin low?
Y'all sniffin blow and postin what they hittin fo'?
Tell the secretary it's necessary we get paid
Look what you made, little kids gettin sprayed
Day after day, and night after night
Battles and wars to the daylight
We might change and rearrange if you do somethin
Til then we gonna keep it comin, Mr. President
Hehe
And I meant every word in my letter to the President
[2Pac]
Word motherf**kin life
f**k this ni**a think?Cuttin taxes, takin off welfare
We 'sposed to just sit here, go broke and die, starvin?
Motherf**kers crazier than a motherf**kin ??
ni**a this Thug Life, Westside Outlaw Immortalz ni**a
We fin' to hustle til we come up

Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These ni**az actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These ni**az actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These ni**az actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These ni**az actin up in the hood, send mo' troops

Dear Mr. Clinton, s**t
It's gettin harder and harder for a motherf**ker
to make a dollar in these here streets
I mean s**t, I hear you screamin peace
But we can't find peace
til my little ni**az on these streets get a piece
I know you feel me cause you too near me not to hear me
So why don't you help a ni**a out?Sayin you cuttin welfare
That got us ni**az on the street, thinkin who in the hell care?
s**t, y'all want us to put down our glocks and our rocks
but y'all ain't ready to give us no motherf**kin dollars
What happened to our 40 acres and a mule fool?
We ain't stupid
Think you got us lookin to lose
Tryin to turn all us young ni**az into troops
You want us to fight your war
What the f**k I'm fightin for?
s**t, I ain't got no love here
I ain't had a check all year
Taxin, all the blacks and
police beatin me in the streets
f**k peace

These ni**az actin up in the hood, send mo' troops


Still I Rise

Dear Lord
As we down here, struggle for as long as we know
In search of a paradise to touch (my ni**a Johnny J)
Dreams are dreams, and reality seems to be the only place to go
The only place for us
I know, try to make the best of bad situations
Seems to be my life's story
Ain't no glory in pain, a soldier's story in vain
And can't nobody live this life for me
It's a ride y'all, a long hard ride


Somebody break me I'm dreamin, I started as a seed the semen
Swimmin upstream, planted in the womb while screamin
on the top, was my pops, my momma screamin stop
From a single drop, this is what they got
Not to disrespect my peoples but my poppa was a loser
Only plan he had for momma was to f**k her and abuse her
Even as a little seed, I could see his plan for me
Stranded on welfare, another broken family
Now what was I to be, a product of this heated pa*sion
Momma got pregnant, and poppa got a piece of a*s
Look how it began, nobody gave a f**k about me
Pistol in my hand, this cruel world can do without me
How can I survive? Got me askin white Jesus
will a ni**a live or die, cause the Lord can't see us
in the deep dark clouds of the projects, ain't no sunshine
No sunny days and we only play sometimes
When everybody's sleepin
I open my window jump to the streets and get to creepin
I can live or die, hope I get some money 'fore I'm gone
I'm only 19, I'm tryin to hustle on my own
on the spot where everybody and they pops tryin to slang rocks
I'd rather go to college, but this is where the game stops
Don't get it wrong cause it's always on, from dusk to dawn
You can buy rocks glocks or a herringbone
You can ask my man Ishmael Reed
Keep my nine heated all the time this is how we grind
Meet up at the cemetary then get smoked out, pa*s the weed ni**a
That Hennessey'll keep me keyed ni**a
Everywhere I go ni**az holla at me, "Keep it real G"
And my reply til they kill me
Act up if you feel me, I was born not to make it but I did
The tribulations of a ghetto kid, still I rise


Still I (still I) I rise (I rise)
Please give me to the sky (the sky)
And if (and if) I die (I die)
I don't want you to cry


I stay sharp as always
Runnin ya bricks with blitz, through ya project hallways
Dumpin crews like two's, ni**a all day
Secrets of war prepare me for the worst
A life that's lavish full of cabbage or a life that's in a hearse
But now my dreams it seeems though, be placin triple beams and things bro
Diamond pinkie ring got the loot poppin out my jeans


Now I plan to keep my glock cocked
If trouble was searchin for me then why not?
Show em what I'm made of plus raised on, on my block
Chancellor Ave, where many turn to the street, thugs snatchin bags
We out for power, makin cash it wasn't fast it'll make me mad
I'm just like, pimpin
My homey on the corner with his gat tucked, in
Youngest they buckin somethin the life he leads
the life he don't need, don't we all know
He tryin to rise up and we just go doe, still he rise


Dreams of lost hope
I hit the strip broke where the fiends get coke
and still I rise now I float cowards ghost
Whenever we come around, I'm runnin down
clutchin a pound, live as sirens, duckin the sound
I used to hustle with my moms til the sun came
My homey Harm doin time from this drug game
Stolen cars, war scars, born a Outlaw
Behind bars, go to sleep just to see the stars
Freedom is ours, though we trapped on a firm block
Crackheads only ten learn to duck cops


In ninety-six my glock's my plastic, pa*sion for blastin bastards
No faces for open caskets, peelin ya cap backwards
Ya cowards ain't prepared for pistol practice
I send my missiles through your mattress
Leavin holes in your body like a cactus
While me and my crew be boppin more greens than topic
and loot to keep the seams in my motherf**kin jeans poppin
Leavin ya spleen to pick up
Half of you ni**az is softer than a Snicker
Let's go to war and see who draw quicker
and still I rise, and still I rise...


Still I (still I) I rise (I rise)
Please give me to the sky (the sky)
And if (and if) I die (I die)
I don't want you to cry

Still I (still I) I rise (I rise)
Please give me to the sky (the sky)
And if (and if) I die (I die)
I don't want you to cry


Y'all ni**az fake
All day everyday
So now I got roller blades, bi**h
Thought you knew
Your mouth is rich
C'mon pops, let's go..


Secretz of War



You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz


War Time
War Time, it's either yourz or mine
Outlawz be on a grind, and a mission to shine
And ride on em', leave em' stuck and fucked from the gate
Set it straight, regulate
wit' a bomb I'm about to detonate (Boom!)
Hesitate, aww, now you know what
ya'll niggaz were here to go
If you know it was good for ya
Buncha toy souljahs all dressed in fatigue
But I'm Edi Amin on a mission to make em bleed
Nigga what?, Nigga who?
It was cool? and at you?, what the fuck is gone do?
Barbecue and boo-hoo
Ride or die, get money all at the same time
Split the pie with the homie, ball at the same time
Any nigga splippin', fall at the same time
We all links in the chain, tryin to gain, do time
We all see the sunshine
But when you could do yourz, we'll bring these muthafuckas war



You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz


As I approach the scene, from smokin' green
Got my eyes closed, niggaz so cold on my foes
I make em' die froze
Watch me make em' bleed, make em' G's
Lord help me wit'it
Got me paintin' pictures of a mil-ticket
Help me get'it
See me and pray for options
but the pressures nonstop
Niggaz get the pistol poppin'
And watch they body drop
I'm a lethal threat, watch me hit your set
Flash on, blast on them bitch-made niggaz wit' my mask on
Do it for profit, plus I'm, lookin for punks to bust on
If you ain't screamin' WestSide, you can get the fuck on
I'm seein' demons hittin' weed
Got me hearin' screamin'
Scared to go to sleep, watch the scene like a dope-fiend
Probably be punished for it, though you can't ignore it
I live the life of a thug nigga, and die for it
Niggaz pass the clip and watch me bring em to the floor
I got some shit that they ain't ready for (What you got?)
I got the Secretz of War



You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz


We do this thug life shit, like 4, 5, 6, dick em'
Down wit' no rounds left up in the pound when the sounds (Here we go)
Squeeze the lead off, I blow his mutha fuckin' head off
Signal all the other outlawz to get this shit set off
Yaki Kadafi, it ain't a cop here to stop me
These streetz is black hockey and raw we get sloppy
Put a pamper on your silly ass prestyle grammar
Locked in the slammer, while I'm layed cocked back like a hammer
Ya'll newly weds that in honey moons, times bout up
Ya'll, that means I leave no trace found with you face, bounce, stuck
Your pig scanners can't come close touch or even hit me
Doin' my dirt, puttin' in work, you see shit, what you gonna do?



You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
Yo, we go to war


We check the murder rate percentage
Niggaz is finished
Get blood checks from clinics
This thug shit is in us
Flowin' through my system, you a victim
Blunts, I twist em', fuck the whole world
It's us against them
you got some heat? Pull it out
Cock the hammer if you wit' it, don't make
No difference here, with the 25 to life sentence
We already doin' life on the streetz
Like algae, niggaz be heated, when they walkin' the beat
This shit is flaky, makin' backs shaky, niggaz hate me
Scared to face me, knowin' that the Outlawz blaze me
Pull me up on game, put me up on a hustle
Once I suck my money muscle, all the G's got devils
Movin' shit like a dollar, beatin' niggaz like Rodney
Turn a killa like Kadafi, and a nuke stream to stop me



You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
We go to war


Bring it on
And all you lil' young ass souljahs
You play this shit back about fifteen times
You'll have enough game to roll up in a club or somethin
Teach these bitches a lil' somethin', you know what I mean?
Secretz of muthafuckin' War....


Baby Don't Cry (Keep Ya Head Up II)


I feel you {uhh} .. (baby don't)
but you can't, you can't give up
{Hey.. 2Pac what?}


Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up {Outlawz}
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up {Keep ya head up}


Now here's a story bout a woman with dreams
So picture perfect at thirteen, an ebony queen
Beneath the surface it was more than just a crooked smile
Nobody knew about her secret so it took a while
I could see a tear fall slow down her black cheek
Sheddin quiet tears in the back seat; so when she asked me,
"What would you do if it was you?"

Couldn't answer such a horrible pain to live through
I tried to trade places in the tragedy
I couldn't picture three crazed ni**az grabbin me
For just a moment I was trapped in the pain, Lord come and take me
Four ni**az violated, they chased and they raped me
Even though it wasn't me, I could feel the grief
Thinkin with your brains blown that would make the pain go
No! You got to find a way to survive
cause they win when your soul dies


Baby please don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up {never give up}
Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up {never give up}
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don't cry


Uhh
Forget him girl (forget him girl) he ain't gon' never change
ain't no hater but that ni**a lost in the game
After the bright lights and big thangs
he probably could loev you, but he in love with the struggle
Everyday, his mind on gettin mo' (gettin mo')
and never your feelings, he's chasin millions fo' sho'
Uh oh (uh oh), now you bout to have his baby? (dayamn)
Another wild-a*s ni**a that's gon' drive you crazy
You got too much, mo', livin to do - I'm spittin this to you,
cause you deserve more than what he givin to you (that's right)
Beautiful, black, precious, and complicated
A new millennium dime piece, so fine she
got em all stuck standin still when she come through
Baby take a little mo' time, love'll find you
And show us the sky's blue somebody other than me
gon' give you everything you need, feel me?
{Don't cry-ahhhhh..}


Baby don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up {you'll be alright}
Baby don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up {you'll be alright}
Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up {keep your head up}
Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up {never give up}
Even when the road is hard, never give up {no no.. ohhhh}
Baby don't cry


I'm tryin to do all that I can, from jump
Now you losin, you was choosin the wrong man
Dealt the wrong hand, you was young and beautiful
Lost and turned out, what you let that ni**a do to you? (Damn)
I knew her since elementary, she blew a kiss to me
Wrote me a note in crayon, wantin to get with me
We was kids, now she got three kids
They see their father e'ryday, and they don't know who he is
Seen him last night, homey roll a E-cla*s
Mad cheese in the stash, still a deadbeat dad
I bring her, Pampers and food, just to stop through
but those, ain't my seeds, nuttin really I could do (nah)
I feel pity for you, you ain't even his wife
Seventeen with three kids, locked down for life
Shoulda chose me, she bout to O.D. from the pressure
Hell nah I won't let her {BABY DON'T CRY}


Baby don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up {you'll be alright}
Baby don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up {baby don't cry}
Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up {baby baby baby}
Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up {no..}
Even when the road is hard, never give up {no-ohhhh}
Baby don't cry, I gotta keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up {ooooh baby}
Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up {keep your head up}
{keep your head up, never give up}
Even when the road is hard, never give up, baby don't cry


Uhh, uhh, yeah, don't give up {you'll be alright}
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry


Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up, baby don't cry


For all the ladies {Soulshock, Karlin}
Baby don't cry
Got to keep your head up {keep your head up}
Makaveli the Don {head up} aight?


As the World Turns


As the world turns..
As the world turns my ni**az grow and grow and grow
and get dough and roll and ride
ni**az die and mommas cry
ni**az got alibis and suicides and homicides
and three strikes and yo' life and my life and times change
And ni**az fame, as the world turns..

Though I walk thru the valley of hell the shadow follows me
Wisdom hard to swallow tomorrow expect apologies
You probably panic, stranded in search of a better planet
Realism hard to understand, we stand slanted
and still stranded, merciless thieves stole the best of me
I pray to black Jesus to please take the rest of me
And still, the best of us build, and reach monetary gains
Some of us kill, but still, most of us can change
if we search deeper, god bless the hustler, curse the first sleeper
Enemies get beside me, flows go deeper inside
We we ride plots keep all my enemies blinded
Time will soon show, a thought can last for years
Outshinin them fakes smile plastic tears
like last year, ni**az stuck in the past, and it's clear
Just some busta a*s bastards allergic to cash this year
Makaveli for the Mob, M-O-B
Killin bustaz is my motherf**kin job, him or me
Lyrically fatally driven, ni**az reported missin
My competition dead or in prison, as the world turns...



(Turns.. turns, turns, turns, and turns
My ni**az grow and grow and grow
and gettin dough and dough and dough
from this state to that state
from this cell to that cell, as the world turns)

As the world keeps turnin round and round
It's gon' be goin round as the world turns.. and steady turnin


As the world turn burnin paths, starin through my rearview
It's a war goin on, and the President is in too
I hear Tu-Pac sayin, "Watch em they'll kill you"
Sippin Thug Pa*sion, scrub actin like he feel you
Steady plottin, ready or not; Outlawz lost
but not forgotten, from Gittere to Compton
A spitter of the hotness, long timeness
So like six I ain't never been rich
I need cream, to buy Ellene a dream house
She no longer fiend out y'all, Outlawww


Another lonely ni**a with a 12-gage pump
with a 12-hour rush to run and get this money, f**k these punks
Road rules I swim in the dirt, I stay in some skirt
I hit where it hurts, I ride or die for my turf
I ride or die for Makaveli the legendary war thug ni**a
Kadafi betta unslug this ni**a, Seike betta undrug this ni**a
Out of the buildin we street children with no souls
Our hearts gon' stay cold, the war gon' stay on
We serve em, like Pac told us to, catch em wet with the tec
Hit em in the neck and watch him die like he supposed to
Napoleon the front line soldier, front times over
Rider for the mightly dollar rather drunk or sober
ni**a talkin thug walkin all through yo' squad
Y'all ni**az scared by a dog, I got my fo'-fo' for y'all
It's like a hot, heated day homie, warfare don't play homie
Better be prepared than try to dunk away from these strays homie
Worlds turn, thangs burn, all in one shot
Rest in peace to the fallen soldiers, all that we got
As the world turns..



(And my ni**az roll and ride, hahaha
ni**az gettin swoll out
And it don't stop and it don't quit
That real s**t! As the world turns..
ni**az die for
How many you ni**az try for this? As the world turns
Murderin methods.. haha OUTLAW!)

As the world keeps turnin round and round
It's gon' be goin round as the world turns.. and steady turnin
As the world keeps turnin round and round
It's gon' be goin round as the world turns..


Only haters caught feelings, when my homie caught millions
And acquired the desired status of boss livin
We cross driven, cornered into a life that's hellish
Payin our dues with bloodshed, ain't s**t y'all could tell us
Fellas - mount up, it's time for battle, it's on now
Two worlds collidin armies ridin soldiers, gone wild
Sometimes I think my glory days was back in my youth
I sought too for family, but I got it lost in these ounces
Now as the world turns court adjourns, I'm sentenced to burn
The cost of my sins too much, nuttin left to earn


October 9th 1977 first day out my baby carriage
Married my Mack-11 hit the block playin
Only five years up in this bi**h, poppa runnin from the Feds
Puttin peanut butter on the walls to hide his prints
Me on my own, not yet grown but only man of the home
to protect my zone in these streets I roam
Dough on d-low, downin straight shots of Cristal Brothers
Hundred dollar snot box on cee-lo, f**k eighth
I need a kilo, got a plot, move my block down state
Got the drop on the spot, movin pounds of weight
f**k my fate and lots of loot to burn, a hustler's yearn
for this dirty money earned as this crooked world turns


Hahaha.. as the world turns..
and turns and turns and turns.. haha
This for the soldiers out there involved in the everyday struggle
Hopin to bubble, keep on hustlin, as the world turns
Money come and go, hoes come and go, foes come and go
Friends come and go.. my soldiers, stay eternal
Outlaw Immortalz, dedicated
I send this to black Jesus, only he can feed us
When you need us, as the world turns
Throw this s**t in the deck, hahah
ni**az gettin chin checked
From the East to the West best to wear a vest
ni**a we ain't the ones to test, f**k you
As the world turns
Outlaw ridahs, Mutah right beside us
Camillion, wanna make a million
Haha legit, as the world turns.. haha..
Burn baby burn


A lot of ni**az get burned as the world turns
A lot of ni**az gettin burned as the world turns..
Gettin burned as the world turns


Black Jesuz


Searching for Black Jesus
Oh yeah, sportin jewels and s**t, yaknahmean?
(Black Jesus; you can be Christian
Baptist, Jehovah Witness)
Straight tatted up, no doubt, no doubt
(Islamic, won't matter to me
I'm a thug; thugs, we praise Black Jesus, all day)
Young Kadafi in this bi**h, set it off ni**a..
What?


I do my shootin's on a knob, prayin to God for my squad
Stuck in a nightmare, hopin he might care
Though times is hard, up against all odds, I play my cards
like I'm jailin, shots hittin up my spot like midnight rains hailin
Got me bailin to stacks more green; Gods ain't tryin to be trapped
on no block slangin no rocks like bean pies
Brainstorm on the beginnin
Wonder how s**t like the Qu'ran and the Bible was written
What is religion?
Gods words all cursed like crack
Shai-tan's way of gettin us back
Or just another one of my Black JesuS traps


Who's got the heart to stand beside me?
I feel my enemies creepin up in silence
Dark prayer, scream violence - demons all around me
Can't even bend my knees just a lost cloud; Black Jesus
give me a reason to survive, in this earthly hell
Cause I swear, they tryin to break my well
I'm on the edge lookin down at this volatile pit
Will it matter if I cease to exist? Black Jesus


All hail, the pressure no endeavor can fail
Some missin souls turn to hoes when exposed to jail
In times of war we need somebody raw, rally the troops
like a Saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
Black Jesus, hahahahaha
He's like a Saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
Black Jesus


Outlawz we got our own race, culture, religion
Rebellin against the system, commence to lynchin
The President ain't even listenin to the pain of the youth
We make music for eternity, forever the truth
Political prisoner, the two choices that they givin us
Ride or die, for life they sentence us
Oh Black Jesus, please watch over my brother Shawn
Soon as the sky get bright, it's just another storm
Brothers gone, now labeled a statistic
Ain't no love for us ghetto kids, they call us nigglets
History repeats itself, nuttin new
In school I knew, e'rything I read wasn't true
Black Jesus


To this click I'm dedicated, criminal orientated
An Outlaw initiated, blazed and faded
Made for terror, major league ni**az pray together
bi**hes in they grave while my real ni**az play together
We die clutchin gla*ses, filled with liquor bomblastic
Creamated, last wishes ni**a smoke my ashes
High sigh why die wishin, hopin for possibilities
I'll mob on, why they copy me sloppily
Cops patrol projects, hatin the people livin in them
I was born an inmate, waitin to escape the prison
Went to church but don't understand it, they underhanded
God gave me these commandments, the world is scandalous
Blast til they holy high; baptize they evil minds
Wise, no longer blinded, watch me shine trick
Which one of y'all wanna feel the degrees?
bi**hes freeze facin Black Jesus


All hail, the pressure no endeavor can fail
Some missin souls turn to hoes when exposed to jail
In times of war we need somebody raw, rally the troops
like a Saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
Black Jesus


Some say, some day, some how, some way, we gon' fail
And it ain't hard to tell, we dwell in hell
Trapped, black, scarred and barred
Searching for truth, where it's hard to find God
I play the Pied Piper, and to this Thug Life, I'm a lifer
Proceed, to turn up the speed, just for stripes
My Black Jesus, walk through this valley with me
Where we, so used to hard times and casualties
Indeed, it hurt me deep to have to sleep on the streets
And haven't eaten in weeks, so save a prayer for me
And all the young thugs, raised on drugs and guns
Blazed out and numb, slaves to this slums
This ain't livin... Jesus


We believed in you
Everything you do
Just wanna let you know, how we feel
Black Jesus!

Searchin for Black Jesus
It's hard, it's hard
We need help out here
So we searchins for Black Jesus
It's like a Saint, that we pray to in the ghetto, to get us through
Somebody that understand our pain
You know maybe not too perfect, you know
Somebody that hurt like we hurt
Somebody that smoke like we smoke
Drink like we drink
That understand where we coming from
That's who we pray to
We need help y'all


Homeboyz


Oh s**t, caught that ni**a alone
Ain't that a bi**h
Hey, uh, this one here is, uhh
for them ni**az that be Johnny Dangerous when they be f**kin fifty deep
But they be f**kin cowards when they by theyselves
You know who I'm talkin about
(You know who I'm talkin about) that's right
You ain't s**t without your homeboys
You ain't s**t without your homeboys
You ain't s**t without your homeboys

Now
Now everytime I see you cats is rollin in packs
For the life of me I cannot see why you don't know how to act
Love to clown when you deep, but when you on that solo creep
out on the streets you don't hear a peep
ni**a it's a god damn shame, somebody explain
why they sent a Bad Boy to play a grown man's game
Tear that a*s out the frame, completely get that a*s kicked
Woke up on the street but you'll be sleepin in the casket
How long will it last, ni**a don't ask, just be first to blast
Outlaw on the mash tryin to be the first to see some cash
My s**t's cla*sic, like my ni**a Nate
Go get the tape, we keep the nation anticipatin until we break
Money made me evil, court cases got me stressed
ni**az aimin at my head but I still wear my vest
I don't give a f**k motherf**kers I'm loc
They all duckin when my gun smoke
cause you ain't s**t without your homeboys
You probably run at the sound of funk
I give a f**k, you ni**az is punks
Without your homeboys, you be the first to reach in your trunk
You scary ni**az is punks, you ain't s**t without your homeboys
ni**a, punk a*s motherf**ker
You ain't s**t without your homeboys
Throw your hands up you little trick, coward motherf**ker


Like Yak said, how the f**k you gonna shoot me rocks
When you got the Outlaw 'Pac s**ttin ya box
You was lookin real weak walkin down the street
Now a ni**a thirty deep, oh you wanna beef
Talk cheap, shoot a ni**a the fair one
Your homies like f**k it, what's this you the only scared one
(faggot a*s) Damn son, close call I bet
Now down around the way you gets no respect
They like that Outlaw ni**a played you out
We could have took it to the firfth I would I have laid you out
ni**az be actin all different when they dogs come around
Watch em act like bi**hes when Outlawz draw down
They all clown, better yet they all stunned
You the type to have a gun and never blazed it once
Get y'all banana split, you ain't Emmanuel
Outlawz you'll never forget
Makaveli the Don get a call y'all
Turnin these streets into Vietnam
Where your homeboys, homeboy


You ain't s**t without your homeboys
My thug ni**az, I love ni**az
From small time crooks to big-time drug dealers
My homeboys, the only thing a ni**a got left
I love my ni**az to death, we ain't s**t without our homeboys
.. You know what time it is
I ain't s**t without my homeboys
Hey, tell em the story how you came up ni**a

Now I was born alone, took my first joint and I got high alone
Now I'm an Outlaw ni**a, I never die alone
Me and my ni**az is so close, it's complicated
One ni**a smokin and drinkin, and yet we all faded
My ni**a Edi had a son we all happy
Cause now that little ridah got to deal with eight daddies
My ni**az cry, we all cry, and all ride
To rectify the problem, motherf**kers they all die
Been tryin to make a million, by hustlin since my adolescense
From crack dealin to rap villian, my new profession
Who wanna see me at eight deep, f**k 3D
You coward a*s motherf**kers'll never see me
Bustin with automatic straps, my raw raps like good crack
ni**az fiendin, I got em comin back
Until I die, they label me as a ridah
Forever, my ni**az be together

Ain't s**t without your homeboys
Thug ni**az I love ni**az
From small time crooks to big-time drug dealers
Without your homeboys, the only thing a ni**a got left
I love my ni**az to death
We ain't s**t without our homeboys
(without our homeboys)
Love my ni**az to death
We ain't s**t without our homeboys
Love you ni**az to death

shootin' craps
bustin' niggas out tha door

More Trouble than tha average

bein a G ain't no easy thing
cause you could fuck around get crossed
and get stuck in tha game
and for tha rest of your life you will sit and remineise
wonder why it had to end like this
and to tha G's you can feel my pain
till tha mothafuckas gets born again

you thought I was a game kid
i'm not tha nigga for playin games
I let my buckshots rang
when I pull tha trigga on my gauge
i'm on tha rampage
makin' runs for tha devil

will get me in some trouble
i'm tryin to ride

poppin' rocks on tha block was a past time
pack a 9 all the time
you wanna test mine ?
don't cry
I die before they play me
from tha cradle to tha grave
bury me

Straight Thug G
kickin' it with tha homies in tha hood
getten' drunk, smokin' blunts
a bitch said I was no good
I gives a fuck
I spend my time in tha dope spot
never had no time for no bitch
instead slangin' rocks
and bustin' caps on you punk ass marcs
fake ass G's
bitch niggas with no heart
i'm stayin' real till i'm 6 feet deep
so when a nigga gone
bury me a G



I ain't got time for bitches
gotta keep my mind on my mothafucken riches
even when I die
they won't worry me
mama don't cry
Bury Me a G



Stuck on Full
Tangaray got a nigga high

I led a Thug Life
heartless hustler
just cause I fucked
don't mean I trust her
now my pagers vibratin'
can't sleep
so i'm mobbin' to tha ho's house
pumpin' Isely
Is it cool ta fuck is what i'm askin
Bitch recognize game and start laughen
when i'm all in those guts and shit
prayin' that a nigga don't nut too quick
cause i'll fuck and get up and let ya know
i'll be a 10 minute brotha for a $2 ho

Don't Get It Twisted


Just 'cause a nigga come in he got style
Don't think I won't flip it
Don't pull your file
But I got enough bullshit to deal with
I'm rollin' with the thugs so
You must be on drugs to the head
Get your ass break down
Broken half baby
I'm a feelin' like a motherfuckin psychopathic
And if you got beef best leave it in the freezer
I'm no joke
Mopreme straight lo
And you could get smoked
You hook the shit you get stroked
And all of that
And later be back for your motherfuckin dope sack
Kid it ain't the type of day to play doughnut
Don't get your ass sewn up
Why you leakin on my blown out
Hey, you're mixed up like a bowl of nuts
You fuck around and got it twisted up
Boy, don't get it twisted


Don't get it twisted!.....


It's the Macadoshis coming from the dark side
The park side where the O.G.s do ride
Ain't nothing but killers in the park
As many niggas lost they's heart
When my gat sparks
I'll bust a cap in that ass
Don't get it twisted
When I'm on a mission, niggas come with Mishy
You busters gettin disciplined
And you're comin' up short on your life
When i smoke you with this mac-10
When it's on it's on
Fuck it
I'm makin niggas kick the bucket when I check em' by inducis
Ain't no think to let my shit spin
You on my shit list hope you got a death wish
I tried to warn you but you missed me
You should have listened motherfucker when i said:
Don't get it twisted!


Niggas got problems about gettin shit twisted
They need to stay the fuck out of grown folks business
Kids get a kick out of bumpin their big clips
But don't front no shit that brought no shit that peace started
Cause I'm a cold hearted rider straight dunkin'
never through with my streets
Never hurt nobody but my heat
East side brothers don't hear me though
They'd rather get shit twisted and gather like hoes
Bitch make ass niggas when I caught 'em
Couldn't bust a drape if they wanted
They're soft like Charmin
But I don't sweat varmits
I suffer with my black group
Just a one-day murderer
On the motherfuckin Rudy Poop
I snapped his soul, son
Ain't no damn thing funny when I spray your ass with my tongue
And your mommy can't save you now
Cause you got the job twisted up
For fuckin' with a killer



Game rules often slang to the right fools
Heavy hittin' at this motherfucker's straight spittin'
Diggin' deep into your brain while tryin to explain
why real niggas need to stick to the game
It's the same got these motherfuckers changin' on me
Jealous-ass player-haters gaming on me
Look out motherfucker homey-G
As in gettin' motherfuckers 'fore they come get me
Get down for the right for the wishes
Fake ass nigga, you in shit, for fightin' over bitches
You call that a player?
Straight-ass sissy
See me at my show nigga miss me
Cause I ain't tryin' to hear that bullshit
Got a pistol motherfucker try to pull quick
And just cause i'm rappin don't mean I ain't scrappin
And if you clip when the shit happens, it don't stop

Now my guess is true
Them thug life niggas is a bull
Everywhere we go
The niggas trippin at the door
I want to dance with you
You can dance at the party and not get whipped 


See the shit don't stop
My 9 goes pop
Your body drip-drop
Throw that ass in a zip-loc


Now you've been hauled away in a body bag
Get your Sammy D said how your blood got sneeze me


Yo you fuckin' with a thug yo your ass gets plugged
With this hollow-point slugs
With ya under the rug


That's why my deaf niggas don't play that shit
In thug life niggas be the craziest


So when you think about fuckin' this
You better wear a vest
But it really don't matter
We ain't aimin' at your chest


Nah we blowin holes in your motherfuckin' skull
Make sure your ass is smoked
That's all the fat lady wrote


You heard that fat bitch sing when my shit went bang-bang
But it don't pay when i flaunt your brain


Nigga, ain't no plain cane brothers come no show
In the casket
Git'n they ass kicked
And blasted

It don't stop



All I wanna do is try to Mac the hoes
Spin bank on thangs sellin me a sponsor on my foes
It's like each and every one they got the look of death
I got my 9 nigga
Don't be silly
You better watch your step


And pussies we crossin when my crew is flossin'
Bitches we tossin'
And niggas we crossin'
It's like a murder rhyme when we hit your hood
It's all good
The punks? I wish you would!


Wouldn't better to just corrolate what we bust
Instead of kickin' dust
Gets a press y'all from nuts
Cause ain't no herbs here
And ain't no morgues
Beware of the water 'cause they full of sharks


But in every state
Niggas perpetrate and test
Where I come from fools die for less
And thugs keep thugin' till their casket drop
It's on 'till I die
And the shit don't stop

And on the scene at the age of fourteen, huh

You couldn't stop us, long as I got my glock, FUCK the coppers
Hangin on the block, slangin rocks and makin profits
I couldn't fuck with the schhhoooollll life, I was a fool

Hustlin in the rain felt no pain cause we drinkin
Playin them hoes like manure

And couldn't nobody diss my nigga
Damn, I miss my nigga

Drinkin on gin, smokin on blunts and it's on
Reminisce about my niggaz, that's dead and gone
And now they buried, sometimes my eyes still get blurry
Cause I'm losin all my homies and I worry
I got my back against a brick wall, trapped in a circle
Boxin with them suckers til my knuckles turn purple
Mama told me, "Son there'll be days like this"
Don't wanna think so -- I hit the drink and stay blitzed
We had plans of bein big time G's
Rolling in marked cars, movin them keys
And now I roll up the window, blaze up some indo
Get to' down for my niggaz in the pen, yo
Your son's gettin big and strong
and I'd love'm like one of my own, til you come home and
the years sure fly with the quickness
You do the time, and I'll keep handlin yo' business
That's the way it's supposed to be
Homie, if it was me, you'd do the shit for me
Homie, I can remember scrapin back to back
Throwin dogs on them suckers runnin up on this young hog
I hope my words can paint a perfect picture
And let ya know how much a nigga miss ya
Pour out some liquor!

"My cousin died last year and I still can't let go"

Look at you
Drinkin got you where you don't even give respect to your partners

2Pac in this muthafucka



All my homies drinking liquor
Tears in everybody's eyes
Niggas cried to mourn a homies homicide
But I can't cry

Damn, why they take another soldier
I load my clip before my eyes blurry, don't worry
I'll get them suckas back before your buried (shit)
Retaliate and pull a 187
do real niggas get to go to heaven ?
How long will they mourn me, bury me a muthafuckin 'G'
Bitch don't wanna die
then don't fuck with me
It's kinda hard to be optimistic
When your homies lying dead on the pavement twisted
Y'all don't hear me doe, I'm trying hard to make amends
But I'm losing all my muthafuckin friends (damn)
They should've shot me when I was born
Now I'm trapped in the muthafuckin' storm
How long will they mourn me ?



I wish it would have been another
How long will they mourn me

(Got them niggas all dead and shit)
How long will they mourn me

How long will they mourn me
How long will they mourn my brother
(Gotta keep this shit goin' on, Yo Syke)



How long will they mourn me
Every muthafuckin' day homie
You stayed down when tha other niggas didn't know me
From my heart to the trigga you my fuckin' nigga
And things won't be the same without ya nigga
I remember kickin' back, you wanted to lack
And goin' half on a muthafuckin' hundred sack
Smokin' blunt after blunt and steady drinkin'
Hung around so much, you knew what I was thinkin'
Tell me Lord, why you take big Kato ?
So confused not knowing which way to go
I'm goin crazy and runnin' out of fuckin' time
I can't take it, I'm losin' my fuckin' mind
So day after day
ride after ride
We'll hook up on the other side
Watch over your family and your newborn
Till we meet again homie
How long will they mourn me ?



I wish it would have been another
(Yo Kato)
How long will they mourn me
(It's still on nigga)
How long will they mourn my brother

How long will they mourn my brother
(Rated R, Double Jeopardy, Mack 10)



Damn a nigga tired of feeling sad
I'm tired of putting in work
I'm tired of cryin while watching my homies leave the earth
I know soon one day I'll be in the dirt
And my peoples'll be mournin'
When they get a call from the coroner
All niggas can say is that's fucked up
And get tossed up
Reminiscing how we grew up (my nigga)
Rest and love to my nigga Kato
See you in the crossroads real soon
For now let me pour out some brew
I'll be always thinkin' of ya homie
Rest in peace
How long will they mourn me ?

Ya know life's a fuckin' trip
And everybody gotta go
But why the fuck it have to be my nigga Kato
Another nigga fell victim to the chrome
It's enough to make you crazy
It's fuckin' with my dome
Ya only live once on this earth
A nigga had it bad, since the day of my mutahfuckin' birth
But niggas say they down and they always be my homie
But when a nigga gone
How long will ya mourn me ?

How long will ya mourn my brother
(This for my nigga Kato and all his kids)
How long will ya mourn me
I wish it would have been another
How long will ya mourn my brother







Ballad Of A Dead Soulja

Yeah.. ballad of a dead soldier
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
Come play the ballad of a dead soldier..


The plan, to take command of the whole family
Though underhanded, to be the man it was planned
All my road dawgs, official mob niggaz love to act up
The first to bomb we rob niggaz
I can be, lost in my own mind
To be the boss only thought's grip on chrome nines
Niggaz get tossed up, war scars, battlefield memories
Swore I saw the devil in my empty glass of Hennesey
Talkin to a nigga on a tight leash
Screamin "Fuck the police," as I ride through the night streets
Lil' child runnin wild, toward his danger
What's the cause don't be alarmed death to all strangers
Maybe I'm a madman
A pistol grabbin nigga unleash the Sandman
Promisin merciless retaliation, nothin is colder
Close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier


Thug for Life I will be..
(this is the ballad of a dead soldier)
A life of crime I will lead..
(close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier)
If you play the game, you play to win..
(this is the ballad of a dead soldier)
It's a crazy world full of sin..
(close your eyes)


Completely lost, revenge at all costs
Payback's a bitch, switch now the trick's crossed
Tossed up and never to be heard of
A single witness screamin bloody murder, murder
Blast tell me homey what you see now?
A blind man and a dead body, I'm read' to leave town
And get my cash though, hook up with Kastro
Homey had to blast on the task force
Stupid coppers tried to play us out, never that
They took my money and my stash, time to get 'em back (heh heh)
Upon my secret arrival
Two glock four-fives, time for survival
Death to my rivals, tell me what you want lord?
Nobody left after the death of a drug lord (eh eh)
The situation's critical
Nothin is colder - than hear the ballad of a dead soldier


"close your eyes and hear the ballad of a dead soldier"


Be a coward, put yo' hands to the moon
When my glocks rang out, the niggaz came out BOOM
Who wanna see me in the challenge?
So merciless I'm terrifyin niggaz in my ballads, do you feel me?
Capo or Capi-tan, one day I'll be the Don
Until then, remain strong
My only fear of death is reincarnation
Bustin at my adversaries like a mental patient
To all my niggaz facin sixty years, sheddin tattooed tears
Another suicidal on the peer
Takin private planes, tryin to survive the game
For all my homies that'll never be alive again
All he promised us is death nigga
Take a breath come be the last one left nigga, it's real now
Villain to fantasize, ain't nothin colder
Listen you can hear it - the ballad of a dead soldier


 "close your eyes and hear the ballad of a dead soldier"


This go out to Cato, Mental
All the niggaz that passed away
To Geronimo.. (?).. all the down ass riders
All the niggaz that put it down, all the soldiers
All the niggaz that go through that day to day struggled
This is the ballad of a dead soldier!
All the niggaz that passed on
All the niggaz with ambition and money in they heart
All the niggaz that want some and that don't take none
Hahaha.. it's the ballad of a dead soldier!
The police are so scared of us
All the feds they aware of us
They wanna see us dead
They got pictures of a nigga head, ballad of a dead soldier!
Tryin to see me in chains, shit
Them niggaz'll never breathe again
Before they put me in a cell they'll see me in hell
Cause it's the ballad of a dead soldier!
Got my pistols cocked
Run the whole motherfuckin block, fuck the cops!
The police? We run these streets nigga
Ain't heard the ballad of a dead soldier!
These niggaz can't see me, half the world wanna be me
Multi-millionaire; shit, it ain't fair
But nigga, you know - it's the ballad of a dead soldier!


Fuck Friendz


My ghetto love song, hahaha, let's be friends..
(Where my niggaz at? Where my niggaz where my bitches?
Where my niggaz at? Where my bitches at?
Throw your hands in the air
Everybody just throw your hands in the air)
Let's be friends..
(Wessyde in this motherfucker right here, Wessyde..)


Approach you and post a minute, arm on my double-R tinted
As you pass bye wink in my eye, freshly scented
What's the haps baby? (Whassup?) Come get with me and perhaps lady

Currency seems small I need companionship (hey)
Through with that - scandalous shit, I bet your man ain't shit
So why you hesitatin actin like yo' shit don't stink
Check out my - diamonds bitch everyone gonna blink (bling bling bling)
This be a thug thang, Outlaw nigga with riches
Cream dreamin motherfucker, on a mash for bitches
Check my resume, sippin on Cristal and Alize
Smokin on big weed, keyed the Cali way
Don't like trickin but I'll buy you a fifth
I can't stand no sneaker-wearin nappy head bitch
Let my pedigree, re-breed me, they're so cheap
Puttin bitch-made bustas to sleep with no grief

Though slightly blinded by that ass
It was hard to keep my dick in my pants
Every time you pass got me checkin for you hardcore; starin and watchin

Was it prophecy? Clear as day, visions on top of me
Erotic, psychotic, we posess bubonics
Far from a crush I wanna bust your guts and touch

You got me sweatin like a fat girl goin for mine

Fuck player hatin niggaz cause they cock block (cock block)

Good Life

I was so money orientated, initiated as a thug
Fiendin for wicked adventures, ambitious as I was
Picture a nigga on the verge of livin insane
I sold my soul for a chance to kick it and bang
Now tell if I'm wrong
but sayin "Fuck the world" got you deeper in my songs
Drinkin 'til I earl, spendin money 'til it's gone
It's the good life - maybe niggaz got it goin on
Now maybe if I died, and came back, wouldn't have to slang crack
Addicted to the game, so obviously we came strapped
Please forgive me for my wicked ways, fuck a bitch
Bad Boy niggaz eat a dick a day, bumpin this
Lord have mercy it's a slaughter
So wicked that my tracks is wettin niggaz like it's water
I learned my lessons as a thug in these wicked ass hood fights
But I'm a baller now, nigga, I live the good life


This is the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggaz that, trust them hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
and live the good life, cause thug niggaz don't die
We live the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggaz that, trust these hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
and live the good life, cause thug niggaz don't die


No one knows what the, future holds, but you
Haha.. listen close
They say reach in yo' heart and you'll find your mind
Every day in the streets, got my foresight blind
My after time is narrow, peepin down the barrel of a foe
Just a nigga or a killer I don't know so
who makes the call will I fall a victim like the rest?
Slug in the chest, one in the dome and make sure I'm gone
Send me home all alone in these cold streets
In desperation constantly drinkin and I can't sleep
Neck deep strugglin tryin to survive
SOme wanna die I wanna stay alive, eyes on the prize
Let me modify this whole region
I declare this sucker duckin season, give me the reason
why I should change, into a softie
.. after living so loftily
It cost me my soul out of control in a devil's world
Me, my niggaz, and my girl - livin the good life!


I spend my days and nights not knowin if, strays in flight
gon' finally catch me, it's the good life, can you hear me?
Clearly over the edge, soon as I wake up
Last night we off the hook, doin way too much
But it's the fast lane only, big dealin big ceiling
All for the money, some kill some squeal
All for the money, most ain't even real
but we still call 'em homies, now what the fuck is that?
Fake love, fake thugs are, all in the game
I watch 'em all plot and fall while we come up and gain
Outlaw never surrender is the call when you hear us comin
Better start to get to runnin 'fore my click get to gunnin
Still in the midst of all the stress and pain
I'm still tryin to get a hold of the game, livin that good life



 


Letter 2 My Unborn

To my unborn child..
To my unborn child.. in case I don't make it
Just remember daddy loves you
[talking in background]
To my unborn child..
To my unborn..


Now ever since my birth, I've been cursed since I'm born to wild
in case I never get to holla at my unborn child
Many things learned in prison, blessed and still livin
Tryin to earn every penny that I'm gettin, and reminiscin
to the beginnin of my mission
When I was conceived, and came to be in this position
My momma was a Panther loud, single parent but she proud
when she witnessed baby boy rip a crowd
To school, but I dropped out, and left the house
Cause my mama say I'm good for nothin, so I'm out
Since I only got one life to live, God forgive me for my sins
Let me make it and I'll never steal again, or deal again
My only friend is my misery
Wantin revenge for the agony they did to me
See my life ain't promised but it'll sure get better
Hope you understand my love letter, to my unborn child


I'm writing you a letter
This is to my unborn child
Wanna let you know I love you
Love you, if you didn't know I feel this way
How I, think about you every day
I have so much to say


Seems so complicated to escape fate
And you can never understand 'til we trade places
Tell the world I feel guilty to bein anxious
Ain't no way in hell, that I could ever be rapist
It's hard to face this, cold world on a good day
When will they let the little kids in the hood play?
I got shot five times but I'm still breathin
Livin proof there's a God if you need a reason
Can I believe in my own fate
Will I raise my kids in the right, or the wrong way?
Dear mama I'm a man now
I wanna make it on my own, not a handout
Make way for a whirlwind prophesized
I wanna go in peace.. when I gotta die
On these cold streets, ain't no love, no mercy, and no friends
In case you never see my face again
To my unborn child

Dear Lord can you hear me, tell me what to say
to my unborn seed in, case I pass away
Will my child get to feel love
Or are we all just cursed to be street thugs? Cause bein black hurts
And even worse if you speak first
Livin my life as an Outlaw, what could be worse?
Cause maybe if I tried to change
Who I'm kiddin? I'ma thug 'til I die, I'ma rider mayne
Touch bases, eat lunch at plush places
Regular criminal oasis awaits us
If there's a ghetto for true thugs, I'll see you there
And I'm sorry for not bein there
Just know your daddy was a soldier, me against the world
Bless the boys, and all my little girls
To the Lord I'm eternal, restin in peace
Please take care of all my seeds, to my unborn child


To my unborn child.. please take of all my kids
My unborn child.. to my unborn child
This letter goes out to.. to the seeds that I might not get to see
cause of this lifestyle
Just know that your daddy loves you, got nuttin but love for you
All I wanted was for you have a better life than I did
That's why I was out here on a twenty-four hour 365 grind
When you get to be my age you'll understand
Just know I got love for you
And I'll see you up there in the ghetto heaven
Cause ghetto heaven gotta be there.. haha, take care
Run wild, but be smart
Follow the rules of the game
I know that sometimes it's confusin
The rules of the game is gonna get you through it, all day everyday
Watch out for these snakes and fakes, friends comin down the way..


Breathin

Who'll be the last motherfucker breathin?
Tell me nigga.. tell me
Who'll be the last motherfucker breathin?


Stress, but busta free
Enemies give me reason, to be the last motherfucker breathin
Bustin, my automatic rounds
Catch 'em while they sleepin, now I'm the last motherfucker breathin




Woke up with fifty enemies plottin my death
All fifty seein visions of me shot in the chest
Couldn't rest, nah nigga I was stressed
Had me creepin 'round corners, homie sleepin in my vest
Shit, I'm like a hostage on this troubled block, call the cops
A thug nigga screamin Westside, bustin double glocks
Hittin corners in my Chevy Surburban
Liquor got me drivin up on the curb, hand on the steerin wheel swervin
Bless me Father I'ma sinner, I'm livin in hell
Just let me live on the streets, cause ain't no peace for me in jail
Gettin world-wide exposure
with a bunch of niggaz that don't give a FUCK, ridin as my soldiers
I just release 'em on a war path, not your average dealer
Westside Outlaw; Bad Boy killer, huh
Complete my mission my competition no longer beefin
I murdered all them bustas now I'm the last motherfucker breathin


Make sure I hold my position, stand firm in the dirt
For all my soldiers gone, we burnin the earth
Outlawz WORLDWIDE, we pack the block
Shootin rocks at the kid, I'll bust back for 'Pac
Ask Yak, he'll tell you that it's hell down here
Stale down here, too many jails down here
Why you act like you don't hear me?
Young Noble, Outlaw 'til these motherfuckers kill me
I'm still breathin


Now we was raised, "Fuck this life," I rose my right
Holdin on a tight grip with death in my sight
And the dark is my light, I'm cynical, sleepwalkin as a true
Walk around town with a pound full of, bitter food
Came a long way from my born day, dead away where there's war play
Fuck friends I'll say, rather die for my A-K
with these fag-ass niggaz, see-through glass ass niggaz
Only ride my dick and the skin of my mash-ass niggaz
Breathin!


Uhh, I walk around with a knife in my back
Talkin bout a bad day, I live a life like that
It's unfair, and I'm losin my hair, blastin hooligans
Catch me, I'm fallin out flat, yo I'm ruined and
breathin in sewer stench, no one give a fuck about me
I leaned to like it like that, when I was still in mommy
The side of seedy that the devil run from
In the belly of the beast, that's where the fuck we come from
And still I'm breathin!


And still I'm totally wasted, they want me to face this
Just lost two of my closest na'r one of y'all can take this
But I'm Makaveli trained, simple and plain
We number one motherfucker bout to do it again
Shit, 'Pac still doin it, you hoes can't ruin it
Two million everytime he drop I know you fuckers losin it
We movin in - for the kill, for a meal, holdin steel
Hold the wheel I'm bout to give these niggaz somethin they can feel
Fakin real, but we the raw and uncut
Style-bitin thug lyin niggaz, give it up!
We hit 'em up! (and we still breathin.. and we still breathin..)


Tell 'em nigga.. tell 'em
(and we still breathin..)
Who'll be the last motherfuckers breathin?









My Closest Roaddogz

Me and my closest road dogz
To my dog named Musolini, Big Syke, Thug Life baby
The return of the mashers, you know how we do it
Hahaha!


Shit half the times we flaunt cause trouble
My closest road dog it was cool cause I love you
Fuck what they talkin bout
Let me take you back in time, rewind to eighty-nine
Introduced me to this life of crime, but we was blind
Little nappy-haired juveniles, livin wild
No smiles on our faces, thirteen catchin cases
Indeed, it was misery
Driven by my own demons, cause they was killin me
How can I be sure I'll be saved soon?
Catch me dip into the light, of a stray moon
It's gettin deeper now, let me get yo' mind right
Fuck yo' enemies, nigga grip yo' nine tight, tonight's the night
Murder murder Mr. Lucifer
Pictures of the devil DUCK when he shoot at cha, it's all political
Runnin from the future, escapin in the fog
Live yo' life like a hog nigga, me and my closest road dogz


Every ghetto street got a crosswalk
Let me get to the other side with my road dogz
All roam in the scary place called home
Take a second victim and if they all gone, my closest road dogz
Every ghetto street got a stop sign
Can I trust in you my road dogz on mine?
Even when I'm goin through hard times
I still got my closest road dogz lookin out for all mine


Haha.. bring artillery and ROLL with a nigga
They could never take the soul of a M.O.B. soldier nigga
Cowards get rolled up, mob on 'em Makaveli
Boy youse a boss player, that's what all the bitches tell me
Even if I died now
I live my life eternally and never lie down, why cry now?
Fooled a few but never 'came a gamer, ain't tryin to hear it
Evil spirits hide at total strangers, yo' life's in danger
Prepare nigga be aware, cause we ain't scared
M.O.B., 'til I die, when we ride niggaz disappear
Fill 'em up with pistol smoke
Never forget to blow a hole in his head
for leakin information to the feds
The burnin bed was the tellin sign
Two hired guns bustin everyone, yellin everybody die
Why the fuck they fuck around, we left 'em in the fog
bleedin like a stuck hog, me and my closest road dogz




Fuck they feelings, that's what they get for squealin
That's the pressures of a gangsta, dangerous this drug dealin
See me in physical form, my niggaz swarm
Take the figure of a circle beatin jealous niggaz 'til they purple
Simon Says take they heads homies
and send them phony motherfuckers to dwell with all they dead homies
Fishin for fake niggaz, observe and shake niggaz
The only way to see six figures, is break niggaz
Me and Musolini set to ride we high
Big Bogart got the alibi if homicide ask us way
Labelled a Capo in the mob as big as the globe
To live and die as a millionaire, on ..
Set to explode, my M.O., is kill them hoes
My pistol's like a disease, my enemies and foes
Get murdered and disposed of, we in the fog
Makaveli the Don, and my closest road dogz




Niggaz Nature Remix



Tupac and Lil' Mo, hmm, how gangsta is that?
Hehe.. ooooh-oooh, ooooh-oooh, ooooh-oooh




One two.. to a nigga nature, haha..
No need to cry now, go wipe your tears, be a woman
Why you actin surprised? You saw the bullshit
Comin fake hair, fake nails, fake eyes too
So why you, bound to fuck wit fake guys too
Aint nothin' hard about it why you lookin sad? Shoulda though about it
Say you learned, I truly doubt it
I guess you got a problem with affection, kinda loose with the love
Gettin freaky with the thug niggaz up in the club
Ask to buy you a drink, you holla Dom Perignon
Knowin I'm a cash getter still I, remain calm
Let you chill with me; plus you was smilin 'til the bill miss me
That's what you get for tryin to dick me
Missed me with that "Buy me this, buy me that" syndrome shit
Bitch get a job if you wanna be rich
Gettin mad cause I cursed and I scream I hate'cha
Introduced you to a nigga nature, feel me?


Kissed the girls, made them cry
Thuggin life, and gettin high
Why you gangsta, all the time?
That's a thug's nature
Though sometimes, I can deal with it
I realize, that I'm feelin it
It's a love and hate relationship
but that's a thug's nature

I'm probably too nice at first, I let you kiss me where it hurts
Me and you gettin busy, slingin dick in the dirt
Met you at a pool party it was cool to kick it
See us, tounge-kissin, you was truly with it
Little ecstacy, Hennesey, mix with me
Picture me pay for pussy when the dick's for free
Hey now, where my niggaz at? Tell these hoes
Before I pay; I jerk off, word to Moses
Visions of you sittin there sweaty and wet
Pointin to the places that you want me to hit
Give me room all up in the womb, call the cops
Nigga, hittin walls 'til them bastard drop
Label me Makaveli - thug nigga with bite
Livin life like a rock star's Friday night
Make money, get pussy, always keep a pager
Cell phone in the ride to complete my nature now!


Haha.. started as a seed from the semen; straight outta papa's nuts
Lustin for creamin - bitches with big butts
Curves make a nigga cry, tits and shit
When I'm locked down beggin you for porno flicks
Sneak weed in, help a nigga pass the time
Put my name tattoo'd so that ass is mine
Tell everybody; 'Pac put it down for good
A local legend through the whole hood, follow me
I got a gun on me, goin for none on the run baby
You know a nigga need some, is my son crazy?
Why I cry, when I be thuggin til I die
Picture a nigga in heaven, high off weed I fly
Got me missin dead homies wishin phonies would die
Hit the weed and hope it get me high; dear God
Understand my ways, livin major
Blessed with a thug's heart.. and a real live nigga nature



[2Pac] It ain't my fault
[Lil' Mo] Hehe, Q.D., where you be? Ahh
[2Pac] Don't blame me blame my momma, a nigga nature


QDIII, and Lil' Mo
Tupac, puttin it down fo' sho' ("Cause that's a nigga nature")
I realize, that I'm feelin it
Cause that's a thug nature
Though sometimes I can deal with it
I realize, I'm feelin it
Love and hate, relationship
Cause that's a thug's nature ("Cause that's a nigga nature")
Yeah yeah yeah.. yeah yeah yeah..
Yeahhh yeah.. and that's a thug's nature

Where you at? Holla

 


When Thugz Cry

When thugs cry..
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my guns to keep
If I die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
God as my witness, when thugs cry, too much is hard


Born thuggin and lovin the way I came up
Big money clutchin, bustin while evadin cocaine busts
My pulse rushin, send my pulse into insanity
Shout at my cousin now we bustin if they yo' family
The coppers wanna see me buried, I ain't worried
I got a line on the D.A. cause I'm fuckin his secretary
I black out and start cussin, bust 'em and touch 'em all
They panic and bitches duckin, I rush 'em and fuck 'em all
I'll probably be an old man before I understand
why I had to live my life with pistols close at hand
Kidnapped my homey's sister, cut her face up bad
They even raped so we blazed they pad
Automatic shots rang out, on every block
They puttin hits out on politicians, even cops, I ain't lyin
They got me sleepin with my infrared beams
And in my dreams I hear motherfuckers screamin
What is the meaning, when thugs cry?


Oh why, children send your child off to die
In the streets of chalk where they lie
Let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry
Dear God..
Oh why, does it have to be this way, our
children of today won't stay wise
Let the children hear when thugs cry
Dear God.. oh why..


Heh.. maybe my addiction to friction got me buggin
Where is the love? Never quit my ambition to thug
Ain't shed a tear since the old school years of elementary
Niggaz I used to love, enclosed in penitentiaries
But still homey keep it real, how does it feel
to lose your life, over somethin that you did as a kid?
You all alone, no communication, block on the phone
Don't get along with yo' pop, and plus your moms is gone
Where did we go wrong? I put my soul in the song
to help us grow at times, but now our minds are gone
We went from brothers and sisters, to niggaz and bitches
We went from welfare livin, to worldwide riches
But somethin changed in this dirty game, everything's strange
Lost all my homies over cocaine.. mayne
See they ask me if I shed a tear, I ain't lie
See you gotta get high or die, cause even thugs cry

And all I see is these paranoid bitches, illegal adventures
Bustin motherfuckers with uppercuts, I leave 'em with dentures
Cause in my criminal mind, nobody violates the Don
I write your name on a piece of paper, now your family's gone
Why perpetrate like you can handle my team?
So merciless that my attack'll take command of your dreams
Leavin motherfuckers drownin in they own blood
Clownin takin pictures later
Laugh bout the punk bitches, that turned snitches
Regulate my area, the terror I represent
Makin yo' people disappear, you wonderin where they went?
Am I cold or is it just I sold my soul?
Addicted to these streets, never find true peace I'm told
Come take my body God, don't let me suffer any longer
Smoke a pound of marijuana, so I know it ain't long
Where is the end to all my misery, is there a close?
I suppose that's why I murder my foes, when thugs cry

I shed tattooed tears for years
for my dead homeboys and my prison peers
Y'all ain't never heard my cries
Now you wonder why would you die?




U Don't Have 2 Worry

Yo c'mon man, what do you mean you don't wanna ride with me nigga
C'mon, get in the car, get in the fuckin car man
Yo why you trippin man? Get in the fuckin car man
Get in the fuckin car.. get in the car
(Heh, say you, you scared to ride in my car
cause you, you think niggaz gon' be blastin at it
It ain't even that deep baby)

You don't have to worry you can ride with me now
Niggaz are quick to scream how they die for me now
Only got one click, we Outlawz on the Row
Fair exchange when we fuck them hoes


Repetitive blows are thrown, to my foes
No love shown get disposed of blasted full blown
My unknown tendencies to mash my car
Getting wicked with my ski-mask, find the stash and dump
Why niggaz run I'm the last one standin the rest die
Victims of my lethal chrome cannon, Westside
Though it's worldwide no one can deny my views
Tracked it to my very fabric once the plastic blew
Five shots changed my whole life, throats were slit
Niggaz die by my orders when I wrote this shit
Though we go back like wild knights at Latin Quarters
Niggaz tried to kill me, and I fed they wife and they daughters
Blazed the weed, draped they seeds, gave 'em cash
Pass the fame and let the game go rollin past
Why you change, it's a cold world taught me life
Retaliation proves niggaz never caught me right
Say they shot me in my nuts, out of luck quick
Bullshit nigga cause I'm still fuckin yo' bitch
Niggaz got me twisted in a bad way, why you change?
Fuck with me, all this shit pay, nigga fuck the fame


Don't remember "Hit 'Em Up," don't make us do it once.. more
Yo' niggaz know, you ain't fucking with them Out..lawz
We keep souljas, souljas from Compton to Brooklyn
Your the type to get sniped, when the cops is lookin
Don't nobody give a fuck cause you done crossed the game
Lost in fame, and you should take, all the blame
You made yo' bed nigga lay in it
Scared to come up out that cell nigga stay in it
It's not a game only got one click we Outlawz from the do'
Dirt stains when I buck on the fo', you kissin the flo'
We dirty as the motherfuckin streetz of Jerz
We sweep niggaz with the words though the heat's preferred
Holla


You don't have to worry you can ride with me now
Niggaz are quick to scream how they die for me now
Only got one click, they Outlawz on the Row
Fair exchange when we fuck these hoes, let the punks know


'Pac I wish I was in the motherfuckin car wit'cha
I'd have took every bullet that they threw, hand of God nigga
I only got one click, Outlawz 'til I'm gone
Heavy in the game and we coming for they fuckin throne
The love is gone well it is what it is
And plottin on us, they best be prayin for they kids, mayne
You don't have to worry cause I ride for ya
Like K said over loyal even tell bout a lie for ya
You put me in the game and dog I owe it all to ya
And when it get to poppin I'ma fuckin ball for ya
And everything I do gon' have your names on it
I'll never let them forget I put my seeds on it


You gon' die before yo' time, come face the truth
In the middle of the desert nigga lace your boots
As a youth, hundred proof, tap my chest is a dead rest
You studio niggaz still remind your vest
Why the fuck you ain't done yet swallow yo' teeth
In the field you woulda been need a straw when you eat
Fuck a glock nine that shit is weak on the streets
And if you can't strategize then you just can't eat
If your life in another nigga hand, you deaded
And if it's beef and your man disappear then don't sweat it
Another fake nigga usin my strengths to get credit
I mean (?) face sound scared but your heartbeat said it


I was born ugly, unlucky and dusty
But now I'm a rider, connivin gutsy
And I don't trust nobody, so don't nobody trust me
And that's how I'ma go about it 'til somebody bust me
I play for keeps like the OG's raised me
If I sleep I won't eat, who gonna feed my baby?
And I think I'm goin crazy cause my hair is gettin thiner
I've been drinkin on the daily, I can hardly remember
I got - bad nerves, paranoia destroyed me
I love the Lord but the church can't cure me
I sleep light, I wake peekin out my window
With guns under my mattress and guns under the pillow
And that's the way it's gonna be 'til they bury me
But don't twist it cause none of y'all niggaz worry me


What the fuck you didn't know?
Kizza-Kastro, Young Noble with the criminal flow
You nervous nelly ass niggas belly up in the river, no dizoubt
Y'all niggaz can't fade me with the clippers
We put it down, look around, 'til we find you we hound
Penitentiary bound, to remind you


Kadafi I bring the lingo to the click
Tasty like a Pringle, sneakin through your chimney like Kris Kringle
On some shit, get me free to let my ice click
Ka-pling, ka-plow, I been a thug shootin slugs since a child



Let the punks know 


This Ain't Livin

This ain't livin..


Nigga - I hear even the smaller G's be dippin Chevy Impalas
while flossin they gold D's, O.G.'s, is who they follow
We (?)swallow tomorrow(?) see, what we leave is hollow
We feed violence and greed, let 'em bleed tomorrow
In time, they grip a nine, sippin wine - hit grass
'til I be starin watch the parents sacrifice they child
The love's gone, a thug's home, with no love
Feelin so strong, make young boys into drug lords
Now one for adolescents, now dos for dose
Keep yo' friends by your side, even close your foes
Now three for Johnny Law tryin to make my chips
I never pulled the trigger, didn't touch that bitch
Throw yo' hands in the air, it's a robbery
.. thinkin 'Pac, would you ride with me
Let's go see what our enemies talkin bout
When G's enter the house nobody's walkin out
This ain't livin, it's similar to prison, we trapped
My homies jealous plus they tell us that the phones is tapped
I watch my back twenty-fo' seven
and never let a busta send a G to ghetto heaven, you know!
This is how it goes when we floss with foes
Before I toss yo' hoe, it'll cost you mo'
I do shows make a lot of dough, murder my foes
But I'd give it all up, if it would help you grow
This ain't livin


Takes a life to make a life (takes a life)
Livin in the world of crime tonight (takes a life)
Can't find a better way to break you
This ain't livin I gotta do what I gotta do


Peep it - gunfire is produced at alarmin rates
Today's youth, grip the shit, get in the car and break
"It Takes a Nation of Millions" if we intend to stop the killin
Just search your feelings, participate in some (?)
They our seeds and when they bleed, we bleed
That's what becomes of lonely children, they turn to G's
Heavenly father can you rescue, my young nation
rest the Lord will protect you, respect due
Not a threat as I step in blue, and check those
that oppose when I froze them fools, and who are you
to watch me fall farther
I disappeared, reappeared as the .. follow me now
Skippin class, and livin fast, will get yo' ass
stuck in the pen, doin life plus ten
Young brother pump yo' brakes for me, before you choke
won't ya soak up some game from yo' big homies
This ain't livin, we givin you jewelsl, use 'em as tools
Explode on they industry and fade them fools
You know the rules, gotta be a rider
You can run the red lights but read the street signs, heyy
This for all of y'all that keep on raisin hell
Put a pistol in your hand and let you fade yourself
It ain't right, what you put your momma through, young G
Gotta change your life, take the game from me
This ain't livin




Why U Turn On Me


(Ol' switcheroo-ass, bitch made motherfuckers..)
Outlaw nigga, Westside, throw it up
Hahaha.. had love for 'em, but why you turnin on me?
Why me? Westside, how you do it boy?


I went from, nothin to somethin now they all wanna see me fall
And the player haters hate to see a thug nigga ball
And they say we hate the East coast, but that's funny
Got a lot of love for, any niggaz gettin money
I made a song about my enemies and niggaz tripped
It was hip-hop until Tupac fucked Biggie bitch
Y'all niggaz hypocrites and bitch made
Now either love me or hate me but real thug niggaz get paid
Have me catchin cases all across the nation
I went to jail to bail to barely on probation
They got a player facin three strikes, and we might
just blast God bless the child that can get cash
But all these niggaz turnin and never learn
Got a long line of niggaz player hatin me but gettin burned
Talk a lot of shit but youse a trick in drag
Like the Mack make you fall back and stick yo' ass for back pay


Why you wanna turn on me?
Never thought you would backstab me (Why y'all turnin on me?)
When you niggaz see me you flee (Why me?)
Cause I'm a T-H with the U-G.. (Why me?)
Why you wanna turn on me?
Never thought you would backstab me
When you niggaz see me you flee
Cause I'm a T-H with the U-G


It, started so innocent, but ended in the fifth precinct
Approach the juvenile delinquent, we still decent
Playin catch and kiss, used to diss the herbs
Fuck school we was skippin drink a fifth on the curb
Me and you, no closer two, while drinkin brew
What you need nigga? Anything at all come to me nigga
You can wear my clothes and my gold for the hoes
Gave you the keys to the jeep, offered my home as an open door
But then you picked a new direction, in the blink of an eye
My time away just made perfection, did you think I'd die?
I never got a single visit yet I carry on
All my old friends too busy now my money gone
Said I got raped in jail, picture that? {*laughter*}
Revenge is a payback bitch, get your gat
Fuck {Wendy Williams} and I pray you choke
on the next dick down your throat, for turnin on me


I put Jenny Craig on your fat ass, you fat troll
Anybody ever seen {Wendy Williams} fat ass?
Why you always wearin Spandex you fat bitch?
I know your pussy stinks, you fat hoe
I'm puttin Jenny Craig on you bitch
I'm about to put a twenty-thousand dollar, hit
through Jenny Craig to come find yo' ass
and put you in a fat farm, you fat bitch!
Thug Life, Outlaw, Westside bitch
It's Tupac so you know who said it
And for everybody who didn't like what I said about that other trick
and Mobb Deep, fuck you too nigga!
If a nigga didn't want to get talked about
he shouldn'ta stepped in the fuckin ring
If Tyson don't want to get knocked out
he don't step in the fuckin ring, that's how the shit go
When Tyson get in the ring, he knock motherfuckers out!
Well that's what Tupac gon' do
When niggaz come against me, I'ma knock they punk ass out!
One way or the motherfuckin other
This old motherfuckin nigga in the South told me nigga
It's more than one way to skin a cat
It's more than one way to shoot a gat
It's more than one way to die nigga
When I'm through, everybody cry nigga
This is how we do it





Good Evening [sirens in the background]
I'm reporting live from Sunset Boulevard
Where many excited fans have gathered with candles
[crowd starts chanting "Tupac"]
Awaiting the much anticipated release, of Tupac Shakur's latest album, Better Dayz
This is yet another post-humorous release by Tupac
Which, raises the question
Where are these songs coming from?
It's interesting how, the message in these songs
Is still relevant today
Even in his death, he's touching people with his lyrics
I can feel the energy in the air, as they count down to midnight
When the album will officially be released
Oh, hold on, I, think they're starting to countdown now


Now ever since a nigga was a seed
Only thing promised to me was the penitentiary, still ballin
Ridin on these niggaz cause they lame
In a six-one Chevy, still heavy in this game, can you feel me?
Blame it on my momma I'm a thug nigga
Up befo' the sun rise, quicker than the drug dealers
Tell me if it's on, nigga then we first to bomb
Bust on these bitch-made niggaz hit 'em up, WESTSIDE
Ain't nobody love me as a broke nigga
Finger on the trigger Lord forgive me if I smoke niggaz
I love my females strapped, no fuckin from the back
I get my currency in stacks, California's where I'm at - right?
Passed by while these niggaz wonder why
I got shot but didn't die, let 'em see who's next to try
Did I cry, hell nah, nigga tear I shed
for all my homies in the pen, many peers dead
Niggaz still ballin


Still ballin, until I die
You can bring your crew motherfucker
I be ballin, they wonder why
(You can bring your crew but we remain true motherfuckers still)

Now as I kneel and pray I hope the Lord understand
When he's gone, devolve, I become a dangerous man
Ain't crazy or deranged, I'm sayin (I'm sayin)
But when these kids go to spray 'em boy I don't be playin
With clientele, any rhyme sales
Question is, will you fuck-niggaz ride for real, huh?
Bitch nigga this is G rated
Plus your homeboy won't make it, street game Fugazi
I'm elevated to the top of this shit
Done fucked around and put me and 2Pac on the bitch
And you can tell 'em THUG LIFE was the reason for this
And I ride for any nigga who believe in the shit
I'm still ballin


Still ballin, 'til the day I die
You can bring your crew but we remain true motherfuckers
Still ballin, niggaz wonder why
You can bring your crew but we remain true motherfuckers
Still ballin


Now everybody wanna see us dead
Two murdered on the front page, shot to death, bullets to the head
Niggaz holla out my name and it's similar to rape
Motherfuckers know I'm comin, so they runnin to they graves, watch
Swoop down with my nigga from the Pound
Cause {Trick} don't give a fuck, where you coward niggaz now, blast
Keep pumpin, ain't worried bout nuttin
Busters thought we was frontin, so reload and keep dumpin



 



Fugees! Fugees and Mobb Deep tryin to diss now too huh?
Hahaha! Well I ain't prejudiced, I don't give a fuck
This is what it sounds like - when we ride on our enemies
BEYOTCH! When we ride on our enemies


HEYYYY! Got some static for some niggaz on the other side of town
Let my little cousin K roll, he's a rider now
What they want from us motherfuckin thug niggaz?
Used to love niggaz now I plug niggaz, and slug niggaz
Am I wrong? Niggaz makin songs, tryin to get with us
Must be gone on stress weed, in the West we trust
To the chest I BUST! Then we ride 'til the sun come
shinin back to brighten up the sky, many die
Heard the Fugees was tryin to do me - look bitch!
I cut yo' face, this ain't no motherfuckin movie
THEN! We watch the other two die slow
Castrated entertainin at my motherfuckin sideshow
BAM! Set my plan in mo', time to exterminate my foes
I can't stand you hoes, uhh
Now label this my fuckin trick shot
My lyrics runnin all you cowards out of hip-hop
When we RIDE - on our enemies

When we ride on our enemies
I bet you motherfuckers die, when we ride, on our enemies
When we ride on our enemies
Bet all you motherfuckers die, when we ride, on our enemies


Come take a journey through my mind's eye
You crossed the game, don't explain, nigga time to die, say goodbye
Watch my eyes when I pull the trigger
So right before you die you bow before a bigga nigga, now dry yo' eyes
You was HEARTLESS on yo' hits
Niggaz love to scream peace after they start some shit - pay attention
Here's a word to those that robbed me
I murder you then I, run a train on Mobb Deep! Don't fuck with me
Nigga you're barely livin, don't you got sickle cell?
See me have a seizure on stage, you ain't feelin well, hell
How many niggaz wanna be involved?
See I was only talkin to Biggie, but I'll kill allay'all, then ball
Then tell Da Brat to keep her mouth closed
Fuck around and get tossed up, by the fuckin Outlawz
Before I leave, make sure everybody HEARD
Know I meant, EVERY MOTHERFUCKIN WORD
When we ride on our enemies

When we ride on our enemies
Make sure everybody die, when we ride, on our enemies
When we ride on our enemies, hehe
I make sure everybody die, when we ride, on our enemies



Shit, I'm a changed man
Ay, turn the lights out
Big baller 2Pac up in this bitch
Y'know how we swing this shit, look


By age sixteen I sold to dopefiends
Not yet a drug dealer, but I watched 'em closely
Until they noticed me I got the feds wonderin who broke the law
Far too inhibited for gunsmoke, I broke his jaw
Words harder than a fuckin diamond
Mobile phone call to Simon, niggaz trippin homey, when we ridin?
Fuck them slowly like Jodeci
And stick a needle in my eye if I don't live and die for M.O.B.
And fuck your homeboys nigga we can drop the guns
I hit your block and we can box for fun
Nigga one on one, last to fall is a baller cat
It's Death Row, why the fuck you think we call it that?
So if you knew me in my past life
Don't act like we homeboys, ain't no love in the fast life
I switch gears on them jealous bitches, who do you fear?
The gameplan of a changed man, so what I'm sayin is


I changed plans but I'm still the same old rider
(Fuckin with a changed man)
I slang a new dope to the world but the people still buy it
(Nigga you fuckin with a changed man)
All my real thug niggaz, go and get your hands up
You go and drink the Henn' up
(You fuckin with a changed man)
Changed man, you're dealin with a changed man


In drop top, the glock cocked, got rocks in my socks
Cops spot Watt niggaz but hardly stop niggaz
Not if they got niggaz, doughboys and hot niggaz
Who mighta shot niggaz but only by strugglin
I'm for respect nowadays they expect me
to be in a Ferrari or the old SL
Or anything you see flashin past and can't catch
Dat's me, gauge on the Escalade back seat - don't creep
Oh what you think, T.I., P and them sweet? (Don't sleep)
Get you hit from your head to your feet (And you don't know me)
I'm fin' ta introduce you to the old me
You walk in, exploded and leave reload
You don't like a rugged nigga, fuck you, blow me
But you will respect me or get it in your neckpiece G
No three niggaz here are gonna let me be
or get you inside there's codes to the streets nigga

A nigga so cold when I flow, bow down to Death Row
Three wheel motion, comin through coastin
Who's that nigga in the G-ride screamin out
M.O.B.! Nigga we ride
I hit the charts like a stick-up kid
#1 in the nation
I fucked the world, the Judge gave me probation
Faced with incarceration
Move tapes like it's big weight, slangin to the whole nation
GIMME MINE, or I'm blastin on every song
Murder my enemies, I'm mashin until I'm gone
One love to my thug niggaz
And fuck a bitch, cause a true sister love niggaz
Throw yo' hands in the air, close your eyes and hope
Never come against the massive smoke, on Death Row
My adversaries BLEED
But fuck 'em all 'til the talk cease, fuckin with a changed man


E'rybody think they understand me
Shit, you niggaz don't know me
Y'all know that nigga on the rap song
Y'all know that nigga in the movies
You don't know this nigga in 3-D
Real live right up against you in front of yo' face
Shit, nigga you fuckin with a changed man


Westside, Outlaw Immortalz, hehehe
You fuckin with a changed man
Hahaha.. you fuckin with a changed man
Hahaha.. I ain't the same, you fuckin with a changed man
We ain't the same, you fuckin with a changed man
We ain't the same, fuckin with a changed man
Changed man

 



You a what? Bad Boy Killaz
(That's right bitch, Fuck em' all)
Hahaha yeah nigga, fuck em' all
(That's right bitch, Fuck em' all)
Fuck all you muthafuckers
Ay Yo Biggie Put your hands up



Now I can make it happen
My rappin' is similar to muthafuckers
When they scrappin'
Blast and watch em' back up
Notorious biggie killer
Affiliation with death row
Niggaz get their caps pealed back
Fool this the west coast
Fuck a misdemeanor I'm raisin hell like felonies
Mr. Makaveli straight outta jail to sellin' these
Intoxicated we duplicated but never faded
Now that we made it my adversaries is player hatin'
Got a Mercedes for these tricks
That thought I quit
Then got a drop top jag for these bitches that's on my dick
Go to a club in a pack
I'm smokin' bud in the back
I wait for niggaz to trip
Cause bitch I love to scrap
Now mama raised me as a thug nigga
With love niggaz
I'm a millionaire started as a drug dealer
I went from rocks to zines
Writing raps and movies
I went from trustin'' these tricks now they all want to sue me
So Fuck em' all



(That's right bitch, Fuck em' all)
(Young Noble) Come put your hands up in the air, it's a middle finger affair, yeah
(That's right bitch, Fuck em' all)



Now could you picture my criminal status at its fuckin' peak
Even the baddest be gettin murdered in they seats
I'm addicted to these streets
like crack is to these creeps
Seein' visions of a prison
wake up screamin' in my sleep
Is there a heaven in this hell
a possibility of livin' well
But if they killin' me
I get my stripes and whose to tell
Choosing to sell
I'd rather die and be deceased
World mob figga addicted to these fucking streets



Now put your muthafucking hands up
If you'se a rider (ride)
Niggaz ain't killers
So they hidin'
Why?
Fuck em' all, touch em' all
That's the way that we do it
Ride up, hop the fuck out watch that bitch nigga lose it
Man I'm as strong as this game
Ya'll be knowing my name (Edi)
A young high strung thug nigga
Created by pain
Livin' my life in the fast lane
Gettin' fucked by the past
Got my mind on my cash and my next piece of ass
So fuck em' all



(That's right bitch, Fuck em' all)
(young noble) Come put your hands up in the air, It's a middle finger
affair, yeah
(That's right bitch, Fuck em' all)
(young noble) I do my girl all by my lonely, don't need no phony homey to

comfortable, I'm runnin' you
(That's right bitch, Fuck em' all)
(young noble) Nigga, we Outlaw ridah'z don't give a fuck if ya love us we

I got glad bags with enemies
Cut up so they remember me
Soaked up in Hennessey
So they relatives know it's me
You can bet your last dollar
I'll dick em' and holla
Ridin' these hoochies
Like they some heavy ass Chevy impalas
Jump up and get your ass shot up
For the profit pick my glock up
I'm bustin' in self defense ya see
Poppin' nobody got em'
Holla Outlaw riders
Mash up on the gas pedal
Vacate the scene
Count the cash and stash the precious metal
Here come the coppers
The swat team and the helicopters
Them crackers is crazy
Why? Cause they'll never stop us
I watch Arnold Swarchzenegger
bust some body in the movie
Now I want to do it too
Ohh, ohh niggaz is too through
True to the game
I claim Outlaw riders
We give a fuck what they try
I'm...



Cause Young Noble behind it
Can you picture me stickin' niggaz for they watch and chain
Kick back lil nigga
And watch the game
Get your mobb rocked and what-not
We keep it poppin' like a drug spot
The streets know what's hot
Trust me



Even my hood call me baby Malcolm X with the tek's
Shower some slugs on em'
I've got a brother don't rest
And he keep some drugs on him
Always in grind mood
Hustle to find food
Ever seen faces of death
That's what my nine do



I keep my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
With my back against the wall
Like I'm runnin' outta time
Even rap with a gat
I must be goin' out my mind
Like I'm up against the world
This guerilla team of mine
Screamin'

Thug Life Bitch, Fuck em' all
(That's right bitch, Fuck em all)

And die for em'
Even if them the last nigga left I'ma ride for em'
Feel me?
Until they kill me, that's how I'm rollin'
Fuck em' all
Let them die
That's my slogan
Fuck em' all



(That's right bitch, Fuck em all)
(Young Noble) Come put your hands up in the air, It's a middle finger affair, yeah
(That's right bitch, Fuck em all)
(Young Noble) I do my girl up by my lonely, don't need no phony homey to call me

(That's right bitch, Fuck em all)
(Young Noble) Nigga, we Outlaw ridah'z don't give a fuck if ya love us we thuggin'
(That's right bitch, Fuck em all) [repeat 2 times to fade]




Now of course I want peace on the streets
But realistically
Painting perfect pictures ain't never work
My misery was so deep
Couldn't sleep through all my pressures
In my quest for cash
I learned fast
Using violent measures
Memories of adolescent years
Their was unity
But after puberty we brought war
To our community
So many bodies dropping
Its gotta stop
I want to help
But still I'm stepping
Keeping my weapon
Must protect myself
The promise of a better tomorrow
ain't never reach me
Plus my teachers were to petrified in class to teach me
Sipping thunderbird
And grape kool-aid
Calling Earl since my stomach was empty
It seduced me to fuck the world
Watch my 'lil homies
Lose there childhood to guns
Nobody cries no more
Cause we all die for fun
So why you ask me if I want peace
If you cant grant it
Niggas fighting across the whole planet
So we can never be peace



Will there ever be peace?
Or all we all just headed for doom,
Still consumed by the beefs,
And I know there never be peace,
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
Cause there can never be peace



Somebody owes me
Will they control me?, nah
I ain't a hater playa
But I want all you got
Your babies have babies
Now we fighting each other
My dogs got rabies
They biting each other
'n' it ain't hard to find a friend like mine
Big fully is a bully
And he don't mind dying
And I gotta be bright
Miss sign after sign
Time after time
After time after time
And I don't like nobody
They don't like me more
And I'm cool with that finally
But they heard it before
Dog
We living in a prison
Losing our religion on em
Thanks given when thankful just for living in hell
Damn homey I don't mean to be harsh
But it's the devil in the ghetto trying to tear it apart
And if we make it up out
We still stuck in the dark
Will there ever be peace?
Just the peace in my heart
Never


The only peace we got
Is the peace in our heart
Or the peace in our mind
Right there in piece that we hold in our waste line
Feel me dog?
Cm'on



Will there ever be peace?
Or all we all just headed for doom,
Still consumed by the beefs,
And I know there never be peace, (never)
Thats why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
'Coz there can never be peace



Things are changing
Nigga you better fantasize
I'm only concerned about me and mine in these times
The world is a ghetto where peace is not a part of it
We all goin' need God if we plan to get out of this
Niggas spending too much time hating on each other
Niggas buyin' guns
Load em up
Aim at each other
And the victim is you and me
The secret is true indeed
The good die
Mostly over bullshit
Repeatedly
Deep in me there's a part that wants nothing but love
But the rest of me knows war is what's waiting for us
So I stays ready
Keep my pay heavy and boss up
Stack my funds and my guns
Never rely on luck
Asking God to point out the imposters
Never let no weapon formed against me prosper
Cause they'll never be peace
So don't rely on it
Soldiers die for
And in the ghetto, they trying for it
FUCK PEACE



Will there ever be peace?
Or all we all just headed for doom,
Still consumed by the beefs,
And I know there never be peace,
That's why I keep my pistol when I walks the streets
Cause there can never be peace



Shit, fuck peace
On the strength till my niggas get a piece
We cant have peace
How the fuck we gonna live happy if we ain't got none?
You motherfuckers is smiling, but I'm mean mugging
Why? Cause gotta be thugging
I've seen drugs done turned this motherfucking hood out
All us niggas acting up
Wild ass motherfucking adolescents
These niggas ain't even got no childhoods no more
How the fuck can you have a childhood and you have a funeral every motherfucking weekend
And you motherfuckers talking about peace?
Nigga, it ain't no motherfucking peace
You ain't seen the news motherfucker?
You ain't heard?
Little babies getting smoked
Motherfuckers killing there whole family
'Lil kids getting thrown off buildings
Motherfuckers gettin abused
Peace? Niggas you out your motherfucking mind?
Fuck peace
We can't never have peace, till you motherfuckers clean up this mess you made
'Till u fucking clean up the dirt u dropped
'Till we get a piece
Fuck peace
Westside




Young mothers
That's right
I feel ya (hey)
I know how it is
(MAMA's JUST A LIL' GIRL)
Don't nobody understand
I feel ya



She was ..
Born A heavy set girl with pig tails and curls
A heart full of gold
Still it won't change the world
Though she could never understand why
Some underhanded plans, witnessed a man die
Was only 15
Should have been a beauty queen
Still see here crying by the caskets when here parents got killed
Little girl don't cry
'Coz even though they died
You can best believe they watching over thee from the sky
Never asked for this misery
But look at what you gettin'
It's a blessing in disguise
When you find out your pregnant
No money, no home
And even though you all alone
You'se got to do this on your own
So baby go on
I wish you luck
And if you need me, call
Just come to me and let me feed you all
I can understand
The way it feels when you fighting the world
Facing all this drama
When mama's just A little girl



Mama
Don't know why
Mama's just a little girl
Given that she's a ??
Time ain't on her side
Mama's just a little girl
(Mama's just a little girl)
She gotta hold her head up high



At 16 what a beautiful thing
The very essence of a jet black ebony queen
And who could tell she would get pregnant at an early age
She didn't listen, had sex
Watch her belly raise (hey)
Got violated by someone she dated
If this is fate I hate to see the seed she created
So we wait, though it takes time to build the body and the mind
She reclines 9 months
Then finally its time
What do we find?
A little grown boy a mind with a tortured soul
Addicted to a life of crime at no time of the growing stage
He learned his values on the streets at an early age
Watch for police
Don't come home (why)
'Coz mammas acting crazy
At the hospital
'Bout to have another baby
Like the rose from concrete
Grown within
Blessed with twins
How the hell can mamma raise 3 men
So we began a closest family
Such insanity
A happy home
For one act inhumanity
Plus mammas said the seed was corrupted
Used the rubber belly
Begging us to breathe if she love us
Now mamma sits quiet
Sipping peppermint schnapps
Turned the house into a spot and made her watch for cops (hey)
How could mamma bring a thug like me into this world?
She ain't the cause of all the drama
Cause mommas just a little girl



Mama
Don't know why
Mama's just a little girl
Liven if she is or not
Time ain't on her side
Cause ama's just a little girl
(Mama's just a little girl)
She gotta hold her head up high
(How could she raise us)



Now
Would she remain in the same spot?
The gunshots rang, they came from the cane spot
Now look here
I see her clutching her son
In her arms she hurt
Her heart bleeding as she watched her seed die in the dirt
Fulfill prophecy
But who could stop the grief?
I walk around trying to hold the world up on top me
Probably be an innocent man
But still I'm the victim of a curse
What could be worse?
Nothing but pain
Since my birth, taught me functions at the pen
Cause everybody's in paying back society
I'm guilty of a life of sin
I watched the drama occur
My eyes blurred 'fore I jet it
I wonder why we all have to die for we get it
Though we shed tears
So many peers I done buried
Worried and scared
Knowing I'ma see the cemetery
Must be prepared in this cold world
No-one cares
No it ain't fair
But we all there
And do our share
In this land of underhanded schemes and plans
Vivid dreams of a nigga having g's in hand
Mamma told me not to be a punk
Fuck what you talking about coward
What you niggas want?

(hey)
They ain't a thing I wouldn't do for my mamma in this world
Cause you know I ain't mad at cha
You' just a little girl
See mammas just a little girl
(hey hey)





Mama
don't know why
Mama's just a little girl
Given that she is or not
time ain't on here side
mama's just a little girl
(mama's just a little girl)
she gotta hold her head up high



They ask us why we mutilate each other like we do
And wonder why we hold such little worth for human life
Facing all this drama
But to ask us why we to turn from bad to worse
Is to ignore from which we came
You see you wouldn't ask why the rose that grew from the concrete had damaged petals
On the contrary
We would all celebrate its tenacity
We would all love its will to reach the sun
Well
We are the roses (echo)
This is the concrete (echo)
And these are my damaged petals (echo)
Don't ask me why (echo)
Thank god nigga (echo)
Ask me how (echo)
(hahaha)

You see, mama's just a little girl

Verse One:

Young black male
I try to effect by kicking the facts
And stacking much mail
I'm packing a gat 'cause guys wanna jack
And fuck goin' to jail
'Cause I ain't equipped to stop how I look
I don't sell ya-yo
They teachin a brother like I was in books
Follow me into a flow
I'm sure you know, which way to go
I'm hittin 'em out of the dopes
So slip on the slope, let's skip on the flow
I'm fuckin' the sluts and hoes
The bigger the butts the tighter the clothes
The gimminy jimminy grows
Then whaddya know, it's off with some clothes
Rowd when the crowd says hoe
That let's me know, they know I can flow
Love when they come to my shows
I get up and go, with skins before
When I'm collecting my dough
I never respect, the one that I back
The quicker the nigga can rap
The bigger the check, now watch how they sweat
What kind of style is that?
The style of a mack, and ready to jack
I rendered up piles of black
The wacker the pack, the fatter the smack
I hate it when real nigga bust
They hate when I cuss, they threaten to bust
I had enough of the fuss
I bust what I bust, and cuss when I must
They gave me a charge for sales
For selling the tales... of young black males

Yes nigga, N-I-G-G-A niggaz

Ay nigga you can't handle that shit!
Pass that man!

Hit that shit, that's the shit!

It smell like skunk, skunk smell like that nigga momma

We ain't nuttin but some low down dirty niggaz
Keep it real nigga, fuck you nigga!
You ain't givin' me near a dime on this real motherfucker
Fuck St. Ide's it's an Old E thing baby
Strictly some of that Hennesee

Can I drink with you fellas? Can I get it on it?

Fuck you Capo. You ain't in baby.

I tell you what! You guys are not gonna be talking
All that shit, when I come back, OK?
We gonna say who the big mouth, when I come back

Young black male!
You know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
Happiness, living on tha streets is a delusion
Even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
Shot up or shot down with tha bullet that he bought
Nine millimeter kickin' thinking about what tha streets do to me
'Cause they never talk peace in tha black community
All we know is violence, do tha job in silence
Walk tha city streets like a rat pack of tyrants
Too many brothers daily heading for tha big penn
Niggas commin' out worse off than when they went in
Over tha years I done alot of growin' up
Getten drunk thrown' up
Cuffed up
Then I said I had enough
There must be another route, way out
To money and fame, I changed my name
And played a different game
Tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle
If one more cop harassed me I just might go psycho
And when I gettem
I'll hittem with tha bum rush
Only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed
Yo, if your smart you'll really let me go 'G'
But keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch tha uzi
They got me trapped...

(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
They got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped
(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)

They got me trapped
Can barely walk tha city streets
Without a cop harassing me, searching me
Then asking my identity
Hands up, throw me up against tha wall
Didn't do a thing at all
I'm tellen you one day these suckers gotta fall
Cuffed up throw me on tha concrete
Coppers try to kill me
But they didn't know this was tha wrong street
Bang bang, down another casualty
But it's a cop who's shot there's brutality
Who do you blame?
It's a shame because tha man's slain
He got caught in tha chains of his own game
How can I feel guilty after all tha things they did to me
Sweated me, hunted me
Trapped in my own community
One day I'm gonna bust
Blow up on this society
Why did ya lie to me?
I couldn't find a trace of equality
Work me like a slave while they laid back
Homie don't play that
It's time I lett'em suffer tha payback
I'm tryin' to avoid physical contact
I can't hold back, it's time to attack jack
They got me trapped

(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
You know they got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped
(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
You know they got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)

Now I'm trapped and want to find a getaway
All I need is a 'G' and somewhere safe to stay
Can't use tha phone
'Cause I'm sure someone is tappin in
Did it before
Ain't scared to use my gat again
I look back at hindsite the fight was irrelevant
But now he's tha devils friend
Too late to be tellin' him
He shot first and I'll be damned if I run away
Homie is done away I should of put my gun away
I wasn't thinkin' all I heard was tha ridicule
Girlies was laughin', Tup sayin' Damn homies is dissin you
I fired my weapon
Started steppin' in tha hurricane
I got shot so I dropped
Feelin' a burst of pain
Got to my feet
Couldn't see nothin' but bloody blood
Now I'm a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer
Ran through an alley
Still lookin' for my getaway
Coppers said Freeze, or you'll be dead today
Trapped in a corner
Dark and I couldn't see tha light
Thoughts in my mind was tha nine and a better life
What do I do?
Live my life in a prison cell
I'd rather die than be trapped in a living hell
They got me trapped

(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
They got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped
(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
You know they got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped
(Tupac Talking)
They cuttin' off welfare
Think they crime is risin' now
You got whites killin' blacks
Cops killin' blacks
And blacks killin' blacks
Shit just gonna get worse
They just gonna become souljas
Straight souljas

All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me

All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me

Crack done took apart of our family tree
My momma's on tha shit, my dadies splitten, mom's steady blaming me
Is it my fault, just 'cause I'm a young black male
Cop sweat me as if my destiny is makin' crack sells
Only 15 and got problems
Cops on my tail, so I bail till I dodge 'em
They finally pull me over and I laugh
Remember Rodney King and I blast on his punk ass
Now I gotta murder case
You speak a' Heaven punk, I never heard of tha place
What is it ta come up fast, got a Uz and a black mask
Drop tha fuckin' task, now who's tha jack ass
Keep my shit cocked, cause tha cops got a glock too
What tha fuck would you do
Drop them or let 'em drop you
I chose droppin' tha cop
I got me a glock, and a glock for tha niggas on my block
4 of'em tried ta stab me, I moved out
Sold a pound a weed, made g's, bought a new house
I'm only 17, I'm tha new kid
I got me a crew, bought'em jewels, and a uzi
But all good things don't last
Task came fast, and busted my black ass
Coolen in tha pen, where tha goods kept
Now my little brother wants ta follow in my footsteps
A soulja

All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me

All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me

Buck, buck, pigs get fucked, don't step ta this
Quiet has kept them blessed, on a quest with a death wish
Tell 'em they come and test, and tha rest, nigga gets hectic
Here's tha aneirexic, I'm making it to an exit
Walkin' through tha streets on tha black tip
Packed with several gats, 'cause I'm also payin' back shit
Niggas don't wanna try me, brotha you'll get shot down
Now I'm kick'en tha block, cause my bigger brothers locked down
I'm hot now, so many punk police have got shot down
Other cops see me on tha block, and they jock now
That's what I call a kingpin
Send my brotha what he needs is some weed up ta season
Tell him just be ready set, pack ya shit up quick
And when I hit, be prepared ta jet
Niggas from tha block on tha boat now
Every single one got a gun, that'll smoke pow
These punks about ta get hit by tha best
I'm wear'en double vest, so aim at my fuckin' chest
I'll be makin' straight dome calls
Touch tha button on tha wall, you'll be picken up your own balls
I can still hear my mother shout, hit tha pig nigga
Break your bigga brother out
I got a message for tha warden
I'm commin' for ya ass, as fast as Flash Gorden
We get surrounded in tha mess hall, yes y'all
A crazy motherfucka makin' death calls
Just bring me my brother and we leavin'
For every minute you stall, one y'all bleedin'
They brought my brother in a jiffy
I took a cop, just in case things got tricky
And just as we was walken out, I caught a bullet in tha head
Tha screams never left my mouth
My brother caught a bullet too
I think he gonna pull through, he deserve to
Tha fast life ain't everything they told ya
Never get much older, following tha tracks of a soulja

All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me

All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me

Straight soulja, 1993, all of it.
I just don't give a fuck
They done push me to the limit I'm all in
I might blow up any minute, did it again
Now I'm in the back of the paddy wagon
While this cops bragging about the nigga he's baggin
I see no justice
All I see is niggas dying fast
The sound of a gun blast
Then watchin the hearse pass
Just another day in the life 'G'
Gotta step lightly 'cause cops tried to snipe me
The catch, they don't wanna stop at the brother man
But then they'll have an accident and pick up another man
I went to the bank to cash my cheque
I get more respect from the mutha-fuckin' dope man
The Grammy's and the American music shows pimp us like hos
They got dough but they hate us though
You better keep your mind on the real shit
And fuck trying to get with these crooked ass hypocrites
They way they see it, we was meant to be keep down
Just can't understand why we getting respect now
Mama told me they're be days like this
But I'm pissed cause it stays like this
And now they trying to send me off to Kuwait
Gimme a break
How much shit can a nigga take
I ain't goin' nowhere, no how
What you wanna throw down
Better bring your guns pal
'Cause this is the day we make 'em pay
Fuck bailin' hate I bail and spray with an A-K
And even if they shoot me down
There'll be another nigga bigger
From the mutha-fuckin' underground
So step but you better step quick
Cause the clocks goin' tick and I'm sick of the bullshit
You're watching the makings of a phychopath
The truth didn't last
Before the wrath and aftermath
Who's that behind the trigger?
Who'd do yah figure!?
A mutha-fuckin' night nigga
Ready to buck and rip shit up
I had enough and I just don't give a fuck

Niggas!, isn't just the blacks
Also a gang of mutha-fuckas dressed in blue slacks
They say niggas hang in packs and their attitude is shitty
Tell me, who's the biggest gang of niggas in the city?
They say niggas like to do niggas
Throw me in the cuffs with just two niggas
A street walkin' nigga and a beat walkin' nigga with a badge
I had to shoot ya and the pass for the blast take his cash
And bash his head in dump him at the dead in
And that's just his luck
Cause a nigga like me
Don't really give a fuck

Walked in the store what's everybody staring at
They act like they never seen a muthafucka wearing black
Following a nigga and shit
Ain't this a bitch
All I wanted was some chips
I wanna take my business elsewhere
But where?
Cause who in the hell cares
About a black man with a black need?
They wanna jack me like some kind of crack fiend
I wonder if knows that my income is more than
His pension, salary and then some
Your daughter is my number one fan
And your jive ass wife wants a life with a black man
So who's the mac in fact who's the black jack
Sit back and get fat off the fat cat
While he thinks that he's getting over
I bust a move as smooth as casanova
And count another quick meal
I'm getting paid for my traid but its still real
And if you look between the lines you'll find a rhyme
As strong as a fuckin' nine
Mail stacked up niggas wanna act up
Let's put the gats up and throw your backs up
But the cops getting dropped by the gun shot
Useta come but he's done, now we run the block
To my brothers stay strong keep yah heads up
They know we fed up
But we they just don't give a fuck

They just don't give a fuck

I gotta give my fuck offs

Fuck you to the San Fransisco police department
Fuck you to the Marin County Sheriff department
Fuck you to the F.B.I
Fuck you to the C.I.A
Fuck you to the B-u-s-h
Fuck you to the AmeriKKKa
Fuck you to all you redneck prejudiced motherfuckers
And fuck yah
Fuck Y'all
Punk, gay, sensitive, little-dicked bastards
2paclypse mutha fuckin' know
Y'all can kiss my ass and suck my dick
And my uncle Tommy's balls
Fuck Y'all
Punks, punks, punks, punks, punks
They claim that I'm violent
Just 'cause I refuse to be silent
These hipocrites are havin' fits
'Cause I'm not buying it, defying it
Envious, because I will rebel against
Any oppressor, and this is known as self defense
I show no mercy, they claim that I'm tha Lunatic
But when tha shit gets thick, I'm tha one you go and get
Don't look confused, tha truth is so plain ta see
'Cause I'm tha nigga that you sell-outs are ashamed to be
And every jeep and and every car, while they stop us
I'm never ignorant, getten goals accomplished
Tha underground railroad on an uprise
This time tha truth is getten told
Heard enough lies
I told'em fight back, attack on society
If this is violence then violent's what I gotta be
If you investigate you'll find out where it's coming from
Look through our history, Americas tha violent one
Unlock my brain, break tha chains of your misery
This time tha pay back for evil shit you did too me
They call me militant and racist 'cause I will resist
You wanna censor something
Mothafucka censor this!
My words are weapons, and I'm stepin to tha sirens
Wakin' up tha masses
But you, claim that I'm violent

(With tons of scratching in the chorus)
Fuck a damn cop, (they claim'in that I'm violent)
Just because we play what tha people want, (Violent)
Fuck a damn cop, (they claim'in that I'm violent)
Just because we play what tha people want, (Violent)
Fuck a damn cop, (they claim'in that I'm violent)

Tha cops can't stand me, but they can't touch me
Call me a dope man, 'cause I rock dope beats
Jacked by tha police, didn't have my ID
I said, excuse me, why ya tryin' ta ride me
He had tha nerve to, say that I had a curfew
Get out tha car, or I'lI hurt you
So here I go, I better make my mind up
Pick my 9 up or hit tha line up
I choose B steped into tha streets
Tha first cop grabbed me, tha other ripped my seat
They grabbed my homie and threw him to tha concrete
(What ya doin' man) they tried ta frame me
They tried ta say I had some dope in tha back seat
But, I'm a rap fiend, not a crack fiend
My homie packed, he tried ta run
(Freeze nigga) I heard a bullet fire from tha cop's gun
My homie dropped, so I hit tha cop
I kept swingin', Yo, I couldn't stop
Before I knew it, I was beaten tha cop senseless
Tha other cop dropped his gun, he was defenseless
Now I'm against this cop who was racist
Given him a taste, of tradin places
And all this, cause tha peckerwood was tryin' this frame up, but I came up
Now they claiming that I'm violent

(With tons of scratching in the chorus)
Fuck a damn cop, (they claim'in that I'm violent)
Just because we play what tha people want, (Violent)
Fuck a damn cop, (they claim'in that I'm violent)
Just because we play what tha people want, (Violent)
Fuck a damn cop, (they claim'in that I'm violent)

As I was beatin' on a cop, I heard a gun click
Then tha gun shot, but I wasn't hit
I turned around it was my homie with tha gun in hand
He shot tha cop, now he's a dead man
I said, come on, it's time for us ta get away
They called for back up, and they'll be on their way
Jumped in tha car, and tried ta get away quick
Tha car wouldn't start, we in deep shit
So we jumped out, (come on, let's take tha cops car)
We drove a little ways thinking that we got far
But I looked up and all I saw was blue lights
If I die tonight, I'm dying in a gun fight
I grabbed tha AK, my homie took tha 12 gauge
Load'em up quick, it's time for us ta spray
We'll shot'em up with they own fuckin' weapons
And when we threw spraying, then we stepin
This is a lesson, to tha rednecks and crooked cops
You fuck with real niggas, get ya fuckin' ass dropped
So here we go, tha police against us
Dark at dusk, and waiting for tha guns ta bust
What's next, I don't know and I don't care
One things for sure, tomorrow I won't be here
But if I go, I'm taken all these punks with me
Pass me a clip G, now come and get me
You wanna sweat me, never get me to be silent
Given them a reason, (a reason)
Ta claim that I'm violent...

(With tons of scratching in the chorus)
Fuck a damn cop, (they claim'in that I'm violent)
Just because we play what tha people want, (Violent)
Fuck a damn cop, (they claim'in that I'm violent)
Just because we play what tha people want, (Violent)
Fuck a damn cop, (they claim'in that I'm violent)

Just because we play what tha people want...
Killing us one by one
In one way or another
American will find a way to eliminate the problem
One by one
The problem is
The troubles in the black youth of the ghettos
And one by one
We are being wiped off the face of this earth
At an extremely alarming rate
And even more alarming is the fact
That we are not fighting back
Brothers, sistas, niggas
When I say niggas it is not the nigga we are grown to fear
It is not the nigga we say as if it has no meaning
But to me
It means Never Ignorant Getting Goals Acomplishes, nigga
Niggas what are we going to do
Walk blind into a line or fight
Fight and die if we must like niggas

This is for the masses the lower classes
The ones you left out, jobs were givin', better livin'
But we were kept out
Made to feel inferior, but we're the superior
Break the chains in our brains that made us fear yah
Pledge allegiance to a flag that neglects us
Honour a man that who refuses to respect us
Emancipation Proclamation, please!
Lincoln just said that to save the nation
These are lies that we all accepted
Say no to drugs but the governments' keep it
Running through our community, killing the unity
The war on drugs is a war on you and me
And yet they say this is the Home of The Free
But if you ask me it's all about hyprocracy
The constitution, Yo, it don't apply to me
Lady Liberty still the bitch lied to me
Steady strong nobody's gonna like what I pumpin'
But its wrong to keeping someone from learning something
So get up, its time to start nation building
I'm fed up, we gotta start teaching childern
That they can be all that they wanna to be
There's much more to life than just poverty

This is defaintly ah words of wisdom
Amerika, amerika, amerikkka
I charge you with the crime of rape, murder, and assault
For suppressing and punishing my people
I charge you with robery for robbing me of my history
I charge you with false imprisonment for keeping me
Trapped in the projects
And the jury finds you guilty on all accounts
And you are to serve the consequences of your evil schemes
Prosecutor do you have any more evidience

Words of Wisdom
They shine upon the strength of an nation
Conquer the enemy on with education
Protect thy self, reach with what you wanna do
Know thy self, teach what we been through
On with the knowledge of the place, then
No one will ever oppress this race again
No Malcolm X in my history text
Why is that?
'Cause he tried to educate and liberate all blacks
Why is Martin Luther King in my book each week?
He told blacks, if they get smacked, turn the other cheek
I don't get it, so many questions went through my mind
I get sweated, They act as if asking questions is a crime
But forget it, one day I'm gonna prove them wrong
Now every brother had to smother on the welfare line
The American dream, though it seems it attainable
They're pulling your sleave, don't believe
Cause it will strangle yah
Pulling the life of your brain, I can't explain
Beg as you can obtain from which you came
Swear that your mother is living in equality
Forgeting your brother that's living her apology
Thought they had us beat when they took our kids
But the battle ain't over till the black man sings
Words of Wisdom
But the battle ain't over till the black man sings
Words of Wisdom

NIGHTMARE that's what I am
America's nightmare
I am what you made me
The hate and evil that you gave me
I shine of a reminder of what you have done to my people
For Four hundred plus years
You should be scared
You should be running
You should be trying to silence me
But you can not escape fate
Well it is my turn to come
Just as you rose you shall fall
By my hands
Amerika, You reap what you sow
2pacalypse America's Nightmare
Ice Cube and Da Lench Mob America's Nightmare
Above the Law America's Nightmare
Paris America's Nightmare
Public Enemy America's Nightmare
Krs-One America's Nightmare
Mutulu Shakur America's Nightmare
Geronimo Pratt America's Nightmare

I' m equipped to kick
Grab you coat and you hat, 'cause I' m prepared to clamp
Scared the (???), and you caught them mutha-fuckas damp
Oh shit 2pacalypse is back and strapped
Attacking the pacs, I' m kicking the facts for stacks to rap
And those that max, relax and let the blacks get jacks
I' m getting taxed, my pacs is packed with angry blacks
I' m ready to go
I' m ripping the shows, hitting the dough
Getting the hoes
Pumping the flow, gangster ho
Cause the nose knows
Check the pose, froze, when you see me close
Punks you gonna roast, host, in a cloud of smoke
Broke, choked on a rope, and then smoked
Wrote, crimes that'll bring me back notes
Nope, I ain't the type of fella that you use though
Kkkkkkicking the funky flava
Pumping (??? ???? ????) producers
Run for cover when you hear the bass drop
One verse is all it takes

*Machine gun fires*
(Dr. Dre) Got him!

(2Pac)
A smokin' ass nigga robbed me blind
I got a TEC-9 now his smokin' ass is mine
I guess I felt sorry for the bastard, he was broke
I didn't know he smoked so I didn't watch him close
He caught me on the sneak tip, now the punk's in deep shit
Catch him on the streets, I'ma bring him to his feet, quick
Pass the clip, I think I see him comin' now
Fuck the bullshit, posse deep and let's run him down
Gots to be the first one to hit ya when we meet
Comin' quickly up the streets, is the punk ass police
The first one jumped out and said, Freeze!
I popped him in his knees and shot him, punk... please...
Cause cops should mind they business, when we rush
Now you're pleadin like a bitch, cause you don't know how to... hush...
Now back to the smoker that robbed me
I tell you like Latifah, motherfucker give me... body...
One to the chest, another to his fuckin' dome
Now the shit can rest, yo tell him to leave me the fuck alone
Two very bloody bodies on the streets
A nosey ass cop and a nigga that robbed from me
Run from your backup punk, how you figure?
My finger's on the trigger for you crooked ass niggaz

(2Pac) Crooked ass niggaz
(Eazy) Criminal behaviour... criminal... criminal behaviour
(Cube) Suddenly I see...

Now listen to the mack of the crooked nigga trade
With the fine criminal mind, cold rips like a blade
It's already quick steppin to the niggaz with the props
And any motherfucker with the flim-flam drops to the knot
Ten o'clock, is a motherfuckin gank move
Stretch is Uptown, clockin weight the shit is real smooth
A nigga's tryin' to play me like he know me but he don't
Sittin' on ten keys, I'ma get him, think I won't?
My nigga 2Pac, got the fuckin' Glock cocked, and he's ready
When the kid, didn't even bring the weight bag, instead he
Welcomed us, into his apartment
Oh this even better, two to the head, he's dead a clean get-a-WAY!
Niggaz got PAID!
And yet another sleepin' ass nigga got slayed, word up

Now I could be a crooked nigga too
When I'm rollin' with my crew, watch what crooked niggaz, do!
I got a nine millimeter Glock pistol
I'm ready to get witcha at the drop, of a whistle
So make your move, and act like you wanna flip
I fire thirteen shots, and pop another clip
I bring luck, my Glock's like a fuckin' mop
The more I shot, the more motherfuckers dropped
And even cops got shot when they rolled up
Best to bring a knot, or get popped, I'm a soldier
I ain't the type to fetch ya, ask Stretch, he's my witness
Smoke till I'm blitzed, fuck a motherfuckin piss test
I'm trigger happy, try to 'tack me and I'll drop you quick
Long as I got a clip I got some shit to hit 'em with
The nigga killer I get iller when the shit gets thick
My brain flips, I start thinkin' like a lunatic
I rip shit, came equipped with a bigger crew
I thought these niggaz knew, I'm a crooked nigga too

(Eazy) Criminal behaviour... criminal... criminal behaviour
(2Pac) Crooked

Crooked ass niggaz come in all shapes and sizes

Verse One:

Ever since you was a pee-wee, down by my knee with a wee-wee
We been coochie-coo all through school, you and me G
Back in the days we played practical jokes on
Everybody smoked with they locs and the yolks on
All through high school, girls by the dozens
Sayin' we cousins, knowin' that we wasn't
But like the old saying goes
Times goes on, and everybody grows
Grew apart, had to part, went our own ways
You chose the dope gaaaane, my microphone pays
In many ways we were paid in the old days
So far away from the crazies with AK's
And though I been around clowning with the Underground
I'm still down with my homies from the hometown
And if you need, need anything at all
I drop it all for y'all, if my homies call

Verse Two:

It's a shame, you chose the dope game
Now you slang cane on the streets with no name
It was plain that your aim was mo' cane
You got game now you run with no shame
I chose rappin' tracks to make stacks
In fact I travel the map with raps that spray cats
But now I don't wanna down my homie
No matter how low you go you're not lowly
And I, hear that you made a few enemies
But when you need a friend you can depend on me, call
If you need my assistance there'll be no resistance
I'll be there in an instant
Who am I to judge another brother, only on his cover
I'd be no different than the other
H-to-the-O-to-the-M-to-the-I-to-the-E
I'm down to the E-N-D
'Cause it's a fall in no time at all
I'm down for y'all, when my homies call
Word, if my homies call

Verse Three:

Well it's ninety-one and I'm livin' kinda swell now
But I hear that you're going through some hell pal
But life makin' records ain't easy
It ain't what I expected it's hectic it's sleazy
But I guess that the streets is harder
Trying to survive in the life of a young godfather
My homies is making it elsewhere
Striving, working nine to five with no health care
We both had dreams of being great
But his deferred, and blurred and changed in shaped
It's fate, it wasn't my choice to make
To be great, I'm giving it all it takes
Trying to shake, the crates and fakes and snakes
I gotta take, my place or fall from grace
The foolish way, the pace is quick and great
Smiling face, to hide the trace of hate
But my homie would never do me wrong
That's why I wrote this song, if you ever need me it's on
No matter who the foe they must fall
Us against them all I'm down to brawl if my homies call
Brenda's (Brenda)
Got a (Got a)
Baby
(Say it one more time, baby)
Brenda's
Got a (Baby)
Baby

I hear Brenda's got a baby, but Brenda's barely got a brain
A damn shame, the girl can hardly spell her name
(That's not our problem, that's up to Brenda's family)
Well, let me show you how it affects our whole community
Now, Brenda really never knew her moms, and her dad
Was a junky, went in debt into his arms, it's sad
Cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know
Just 'cause you're in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow
But oh, that's a thought-my own revelation
Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
Her boyfriend was her cousin, now let's watch the joy end
She tried to hide her pregnancy from her family
Who didn't really care to see, or give a damn if she
Went out, and had a church of kids
As long as when the check came they got first dibs
Now Brenda's belly's gettin' bigger
But no one seems to notice any change in her figure
She's twelve years old, guess she's havin' a baby
In love with a molester who's sexin' her crazy
And yet in all, she thinks that he'll be with her forever
And dreams of a world where the two of 'em are together,
Whatever, he left her, and she had the baby solo
She had it on the bathroom floor, and didn't know so
She didn't know what to throw away, and what to keep
She wrapped the baby up, and threw him in a trash heep
I guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the cries
She didn't realize how much the little baby had her eyes
Now the baby's in the trash heep, ballin'
Mama can't help him, but it hurts to hear him callin'
Brenda wants to run away, Mama say
You making me lose pay, a social worker's here everyday
Now, Brenda's gotta make her own way
Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay
No money, no babysitters, she couldn't keep a job
She tried to sell crack, but ended up gettin' robbed
So now what's next, there ain't nothin' left to sell
So she sees sex as her way of leavin' hell
It's payin' the rent, so she really can't complain
Prostitute found slain, and Brenda's her name
She's got a baby

Baby

Don't you know she's got a (don't you know)
Don't you know she's got a (don't you know)
Don't you know she's got a babe (baby)
(She's havin' a baby)
Don't you know she's got a (yes, she is)
Don't you know she's got a (yes, she is)
Don't you know she's got a baby
(I know she's havin' a baby)
Don't you know she's got a (I know I know)
Don't you know she's got a (I know)
Don't you know she's got a babe (I know)
(I know know know know know know know)
Don't you know she's got a (know know know know know know know)
Don't you know she's got a
Don't you know she's got a babe
Don't you know she's got a
Don't you know she's got a
Don't you know she's got a babe
Don't you know she's got a
Don't you know she's got a
Don't you know she's got a babe
(Tupac)
Oh shit! Jumped on my man's dick
Heard he had a twelve inch, now the bitch is lovesick
Who's to blame, the guy or the groupie?
Heard I was down with D.U., now she wants to do me
Ooh-wee! This is the life
New bitch every night, never tripped off a wife
It ain't right, but it's cool how they come quick
Don't try to flip with the lip 'cause I run shit
Hip hip, hooray for the AK
Spray when I lay competition, what a great day
Make pay, next is the wet sex
Hexed with the vex now they wreck with the complex
I'm set, wonder what I tote, check
Bloody as a Kotex, snappin motherfuckers' necks
Revenge so sweet when it comes from
Niggaz get done with the drum, watch my foes run
Nigga keeps comin' when they can't slip
Full of that shit, another hit from Tha' Lunatic

(Stretch)
Yeah, fuck that God! Word up
Blowin' niggaz out the motherfuckin frame yaknahmsayin?
Constantly... fuck that trick, we ain't havin' it

(Tupac)
Leave me the fuck alone, you gets none of this
It's suicidal, you lose your title like Doug-las
'Cause I'm nothin' nice and, I'm icin like Tyson
I'm grippin the mic and, my DJ is slicin
I'm tired of motherfuckers steppin to me with the SAME OLD
Tryin' to do me like Nintendo
How the fuck you think I ever got this far?
By bootin motherfuckers like a shootin star
'Cause I'm out to show, that I'm a dope MC
Think crack had you fiendin, wait'll they get a load of me
Bitches on my dick like a motherfuckin condom
Niggaz wanna flip, let 'em step, and I'll bomb 'em
See somethin' you want, why don't you come and get it
And then get waxed and taxed, like the government
Then I leave you sittin' there, wonder where your money went
While your bitch is callin me, tellin' me to come again
Nigga I'm loc'ed, when I smoke, from the indo
But we can be friends though, after you get broke like a window
That's what you provoked, and now you're smoked out
Lookin' like a bitch, cause your whole fuckin' posse, broke out
Punk motherfucker couldn't roll on
He couldn't hold on, game is too strong, nigga
Leave me the fuck alone, you gets none of this
Feel the wrath... and revenge of Tha' Lunatic

(Stretch)
Yeah Tu', tell them motherfuckers, word up
We ain't havin' it, NONE of that shit!
Bitch ass niggaz, niggaz can't fuck with us Tu', word up
Ninety-one, we takin' this WHOLE motherfucker over
Niggaz got PROBLEMS in ninety-one
Ninety-two, and ninety-three
And all that other shit, word up!

(Tupac)
Recognize game when it smacks you, bitch I'm back to rip
Puttin' this on the map with this mackin shit
Time will tell if it's made well
Well I raise hell and excel cause it pays well
Jordan couldn't dunk it any harder, pump it any farther
I'm funky, that's word to the father
Act like you know 'fore I thump, the bolo
Thought you was a pimp, now you're simpin for my solo
Oh no, not another new jack, swearin that he's ruthless
Ducked, and now he's fucked and left toothless
I can hear the fear in your flow, you ain't prepared
You're scared and you're bound to go
It's somethin', I guess I let the beat keep bumpin
Stop trippin' off these niggaz 'cause they ain't about nuttin
Or should I say NAYthin
Punk put my tape in, fuck all the fake-in
I'm sick of the bullshit
Come equipped and get ready to rip
Or get the dick of Tha' Lunatic

(Stretch)
Ah yeah! FUCK THAT! (the motherfuckin lunatic)
YouknowhatI'msayin? Yes Tu'!
Tell them niggaz what time it is knahmsayin?
(Punk motherfuckers, get the dick of the lunatic)
Niggaz can't fuck with us, word up
Bitch ass niggaz, FUCK EM!

(Tupac)
Fuck all them niggaz
I'm tellin' these niggaz that they ain't got...
NAYthin on a nigga like me
We squashin these punk motherfuckers in ninety-one
Ninety-two ninety-three... and SO on
So let the beat FLOAT on
While I spray these PUNK BITCHES
With these dope ass lyrics
Thanks to Poppa for supplyin the DANK
Now it's money in the BANK
And all y'all niggaz shit STANK
Compared to this shit...

Fuck y'all punk bitches!
Tha' Lunatic
*Echoes to fade*
Rebel, rebel, rebel

(2Pac)
They just can't stand the reign
Or the occasional pain
Of a man like me who goes against the grain.
Sometimes I do it in vain
So wit the little bass and treble ain't missed a
So it's time for me to explain that I'm the rebel.
Cold as the devil.
Straight from the underground, the rebel alone laughs.
They came to see the maniac sychopath.
The critics heard of me and the aftermath.
I don't give a damn and it shows.
A when I do a stage show I wear street clothes.
So they all know me: the lyrical lunatic, the maniac MC.
I give a shout out to your homies.
Maybe then, the critics'll leave your boy alone, G.
On the streets or on TV, it just don't pay the be a truth tellin' MC.
They won't be happy till I'm banned.
The most dangerous weapon: an educated black man.
For point blank in your face, pump up the bass, and join the human race.
I throw peace to the Bay.
'Cause from the jungle to Oaktown, they backin me up all the way.
You know ya gotta love the sound.
It's from the rebel: the rebel of the underground.

He's the rebel: rebel of the underground (4X)

(2Pac)
Now I'm face to face with the devil.
'Cause they breedin more rebels than the whole damn ghetto.
And police brutality,
Put you in a nip and call it technicality.
So you reap what you soe.
So read the wrath of the rebel jackin 'em up once more.
Now the fox is in the henhouse.
Creepin' up on your daughter, while you asleep
I got her sneakin out.
Tupac ain't nuttin nice.
I'll be nothin' how I wanna and do it when I'm gonna.
Now I'm up to no good.
The mastermind of mischief movin more than most could.
So sit and slip into the sound.
Peep the rebel: the rebel of the underground.

He's the rebel: rebel of the underground (4X)

(2Pac)
They say they hate me, they wanna hold me down.
I guess they scared of the rebel: the rebel of the underground.
But I never let it get me.
I just make another record 'bout the punks tryin' to sweat me.
In fact, they tryin' to keep me out.
Try to censor what I say 'cause they don't like what I'm talkin' 'bout.
So what's wrong with the media today.
Got brothers sellin out 'cause they greedy to get paid.
But me, I'm comin' from the soul.
And if it don't go gold, my story still get told.
And that way they can't stop me.
And if it sells a couple of copies, the punks'll try to copy.
It's sloppy, don't even try to.
I'm a slave to the rhythm and I'm about to fly through.
Sold yo (ya-yo) to the people in the ghetto.
When ya hear the bass roll, go ahead and let go.
Now everybody wanna gangbang.
They talkin' street slang, but the punk still can't hang.
By makin' records bout violence
But when it comes to the real, some brothers go silent.
It kinda make you wanna think about
That ya gotta do some sellin out, just to get your record out.
But 2pacalpyse is straight down.
So feel the wrath of the rebel: the rebel of the underground.

2pac is the rebel: rebel of the underground (8X)
Unfortunately, we are not licensed to display the full lyrics for this song at the moment. Hopefully we will be able to in the future. Until then... how about a random page?
Aww yeah, uh, uh
Holla if ya hear me, yeah!

(Verse One)
Here we go, turn it up, let's start
From block to block we snatchin hearts and jackin marks
And the punk police can't fade me, and maybe
We can have peace someday G
But right now I got my mind set up
Lookin' down the barrel of my nine, get up
'Cause it's time to make the payback fat
To my brothers on the block better stay strapped, black
And accept no substitutes
I bring truth to the youth tear the roof off the whole school
Oh no, I won't turn the other cheek
In case ya can't see us while we burn the other week
Now we got him in a smash, blast
How long will it last till the po' gettin' mo' cash
Until then, raise up!
Tell my young black males, blaze up!
Life's a mess don't stress, test
I'm givin' but be thankful that you're livin', blessed
Much love to my brothers in the pen
See ya when I free ya if not when they shove me in
Once again it's an all out scrap
Keep your hands on ya gat, and now ya boys watch ya back
Cause in the alleys out in Cali I'ma tell ya
Mess with the best and the vest couldn't help ya
Scream, if ya feel me; see it clearly?
You're too near me -

(2Pac) Holla if ya hear me!
"Hard!" ... "Tellin' you to hear it, the rebel" - P.E.
"Tellin' you to hear it.."

"Tellin' you to hear it.."

(Verse Two)
Pump ya fists like this
Holla if ya hear me - PUMP PUMP if you're pissed
To the sell-outs, livin' it up
One way or another you'll be givin' it up, huh
I guess 'cause I'm black born
I'm supposed to say peace, sing songs, and get capped on
But it's time for a new plan, BAM!
I'll be swingin' like a one man, clan
Here we go, turn it up, don't stop
To my homies on the block gettin' dropped by cops
I'm still around for ya
Keepin' my sound underground for ya
And I'ma throw a change up
Quayle, like you never brought my name up
Now my homies in the backstreets, the blackstreets
They feel me when they rollin' in they fat jeeps
This ain't just a rap song, a black song
Tellin' all my brothers, get they strap on
And look for me in the struggle
Hustlin till other brothers bubble -

(2Pac) Holla if ya hear me!
"Tellin' you to hear it, the rebel" - P.E.
"Tellin' you to hear it.."
(2Pac) Holla if ya hear me!
"Hard!" ... "Tellin' you to hear it, the rebel" - P.E.

(2Pac) Holla if ya hear me!
"Hard!" ... "Tellin' you to hear it, the rebel" - P.E.
"Tellin' you to hear it.."
(2Pac) Holla if ya hear me!

(Verse Three)
Will I quit, will I quit?
They claim that I'm violent, but still I keep
Representin, never give up, on a good thing
Wouldn't stop it if we could it's a hood thing
And now I'm like a major threat
'Cause I remind you of the things you were made to forget
Bring the noise, to all my boyz
Know the real from the bustas and the decoys
And if ya hustle like a real G
Pump ya fists if ya feel me, holla if ya hear me
Learn to survive in the nine-tre'
I make rhyme pay, others make crime pay
Whatever it takes to live and stand
Cause nobody else'll give a damn
So we live like caged beasts
Waitin for the day to let the rage free
Still me, till they kill me
I love it when they fear me -

(2Pac) Holla if ya hear me!
"Tellin' you to hear it, the rebel" - P.E.
"Tellin' you to hear it.."
(2Pac) Holla if ya hear me!
"Hard!" ... "Tellin' you to hear it, the rebel" - P.E.
"Tellin' you to hear it.."

"Tellin' you to hear it.."
(2Pac) Holla if ya hear me!
"Hard!" ... "Tellin' you to hear it, the rebel" - P.E.
"Tellin' you to hear it.."

(2Pac) You're too near me, to see it clearly

(2Pac) Holla if ya hear me!
"Hard!" ... "Tellin' you to hear it, the rebel" - P.E.
"Tellin' you to hear it.."

"Hard!" ... "Tellin' you to hear it, the rebel" - P.E.

"Hard!" ... "The rebel"
"Hard!" ... "The rebel"

(Repeat 12X to fade)

I was raised in this society so there's no way
You can expect me to be a perfect person 'cause I'm a do what I'm a do.

(They gotta understand me)
(Withdraw on this record) - Dan Quayle
That's how I feel I'm a do whatever I like. I am not a role model
"You could get the finger... the middle!" (1}
"Come and get some!" (2}

(2Pac)
Ah yeah, they love to point the finger
(1} (2}

Boom boom boom on your black ass, bitch
(1} (2} Niggaz love to point the finga
Boom boom boom on your black ass, bitch
(1} (2}

(2Pac)
I thought I hit rock bottom, they ban my album, point the finga
I guess nobody loves a real nigga-slash-rap singer
I thought I'd bring a little truth to the young troops
I brought proof that the niggaz need guns too
It's not to be a racist, but let's face this:
Wouldn't you if we could trade places?
I got lynched by some crooked cops, and to this day
Them same motherfuckers on the beat gettin' major paid
But when I get my check they takin' tax out
So, we payin' for these pigs to knock the blacks out
Ain't that a bitch, some officers are gettin' rich
Whoopin on thugs and robbin drug dealers for they shit
As far as jealousy, bein a celebrity
No matter who committed the crime, they all yell at me
And the media is greedier than most
You could sell 'em your soul or they'll be on ya till a niggaz ghost
And everyday I read the paper there's another lie
They show my picture for the crimes of another guy
Now how's that for the life of a big shot
A dead cop, a law suit, a little kid shot
I play them nuttin ass marks in the park
For tryin' to earn they stripes in the dark
Just 'cause I come there, don't mean I from there, peep:
Only jealous motherfuckers beef, and point the finga

Chorus: repeat 4X

Boom boom boom on your black ass, bitch
(1} (2}

(2Pac)
As I run up on 'em madman, a nutcase with a screw loose
A zoot troupe full of foolies with toolies
Niggaz run to me don't come to me with beef
Take your jewels and your jeep, boom boom! Let that ass sleep
It's gettin' hectic, niggaz run, quick
Buckshots are the payback for dumb shit
All you niggaz on the block tryin' to test me
Best wear a vest or get open like, sesame
I'll run up on you mad deep; while you're tryin' to sleep
I'm steady pumpin bullets in your sheets
Wake up, motherfucker, don't stutter
Point blank by a nigga from the gutter, yeah!
Gimme mine, gimme mine, gimme, mine
Ban my rhymes, now I'm back to bustin', nines
And bustaz can't get none, hell no
A quick flurry and he's buried with a swelled jaw
I came up from the amateurs to pro hits
At 5-0, so you know I take no shit
And everybody wants to kill a bringer
Of bad news, so they choose, to point the finga


(2Pac)
One two three, peace to the real G's
Still me, till these motherfuckers kill me
I bring skills and I build, kill at will
Smoke sess till I'm ill, still feel me?
I say one two three, peace to the real G's
Still me, till these motherfuckers kill me
Pick it up, pick it up, give it up
Best to duck or get fucked for your bucks
Scream one two three, peace to the real G's
Still me, till these motherfuckers kill me
I can't give up, it's a black thang
And I ain't goin' back to the crack game
(You can do it son; be a man and stand up or run)
Bitches, let 'em point the finga
(You can do it son; be a man and stand up or run)
Snitches, let 'em point the finga
Yo, one two three, peace to the real G's
Still me, till these motherfuckers kill me
I guess nobody loves a rap singer
That's why these motherfuckers... (hahaha!) point the finga
(Laughter echoed)

I've changed...
You mothafuckas kill me
I've changed...

It ain't that I've changed
But it's strange how you mothafuckas rearrange
When I found fame
Point ya finger at tha bad guy

You know what my momma usta tell me
If ya can't find something ta live 4

Then you best, find something ta die 4

(Eazy saying 'if there's hell below, we're all gonna go')
Repeats through interlude

Deep deep

La'tasha Hardings
Remember that name...
Cause a bottle of juice...
Is not something 2 die 4

Young Quaid
Remember that name...
Cause all you mothafuckas
That go to your grave with that name on your brain
Cause jelousy and recklousness
Is not, something 2 die 4

All you Niggas out there
(Echoed laughter)
Got a crack that crumbles
When I say all you Niggas (all you niggas)
Unite
One nigga, teach 2 niggas
4 niggas teach more niggas
All tha poor niggas
Tha penn niggas
Tha rich niggas
Tha strong niggas
Unite

There's more of us than there is of them
Look around...
Check your strip

Deep deep

That's something 2 die 4

Black

That's something 2 live 4

(Boom, Boom) Mama ain't raised no suckers
Dan Quayle, don't you know you need to get your ass kicked
Where was you when there was niggas in the caskets?
Mutha-fucker rednecks all the same
Feel a real nigga if he ain't balled and chained
That's why we burn shit and wreck
Cause the punk police ain't learned shit yet
You mutha-fuckas gonna pay the price
Can't make a Black life, don't take a Black life
It's on, the next real nigga fall dead
Dred, jheri curl, process, or bald head
Be prepared for the smoke to bust
What niggas need to do is start loc'in up
United we stand divided we fall
They can shoot one nigga
But they can't take us alll
Let's get along with the Mexicans
And we can all have peace on the sets again
Imagine that if it took place (ha ha ha)
Keeping the smile off their white fakes
I ain't racist but lets trade places
Trace the hate 'n' face it
One nigga teach two niggas
Three teach four niggas
And them niggas teach more niggas
And when we blast
That'll be the biggest blast you've heard
And them is my last wordz
(Dorky sounding white guy)

So what the fuck you talkin' about?! Aw, shit.
Goody, goody, gumdrops.

Rock it till the drum stops.
Hip hop.

And it probably wouldn't stop.
Talk shit and get socked.
How ya hang em?
Know a realer nigga? You could bring him.
If I don't represent the shit,
I'll kick it.
We could sway him.
As if I know ya.
Huh. Then I could show ya.
But if I don't know, I gotta fo' fo' fo' ya.
So, so peep game
At point blank range.
The fame can't change what the game maintains.
Strange. Wind against the grain.
Aw shit. Flick or no flick I trips for no bitch.
Catch up on your pimpin'.
I ain't simpin. I'm a dis her.
Couldn't be my sister if she actin' like I missed her.
Tell me why they, tell me why they, tell me why they play me.
Don't these niggas know that neither one of y'all can fade me.
I ain't big, I ain't buff, I ain't diesel.
But fuck wit Tupac and pop goes the weesel.
Me and Threat made a bet on how many fellas
Would jack a motha fuckin' real nigga 'cause they jealous.
They do it for the fame.
Explain. Insane. What's in a name? What's in a name?
Peep game.

Punk bitch, how ya like me now?
Can't fuck around wit the funky style.

Killa Cali.
The state where they kill.
Down wit Oaktown? What's up homie, can I chill?
The bitches lookin' funny.
Feel 'em at me. Feel 'em at me wit they minds on they heaven

*Na, that's just a hooch looking for some juice.
-What's up my nigga? What ya know? A nigga got a little bigger.
That's all folks know.
No Fat gold ropes.
Gotta keep a low key for my attack.
When I approach, I want the diamonds, the pearls.
The round the way girls.
'Cause baby got, baby got back out this world.
Would you give a fee? Never.
Fly like a feather.
Make more money than your daddie and your mother put together.
The game is to be sold, not to be told.
So buy it.
Can't afford it?
Low budget hoes gotta brother.
Peep game.


Don't sell out.
Get the hell out.
'Cause here I come.
Hit 'em with my bop gun.
They came and they blast.

Time to get paid, time to get paid. Check.

First sucka jump, first nigga die.
Gimme mine, gimme mine, gimme mine like I told ya.
Hard as a boulder.
Motha fuckin' souja.
Boom bam boom! It's a stick up.
Vice president Dan Quayle eat a dick up.
Peep game.


(Spoken by Tupac)
Punk bitch
Fuck all those motha fuckas, they all can eat a motha fuckin' dick up.
Word up. Fuck the police. I don't give a fuck.
Bobcat in this motha fucka boy.
Big up! Big up! To the criminals.
Fuck em.

This is serious business.

Yeah, microphone mafia.
Tupac, Threat, Bobcat.
93 shot.
Yeah nigga, bitch
Eat a dick up

Chorus (Rakim):
Stick up, stick up, stick up kids...
Still don't nothin' move but the money (2x)

Verse One: Live Squad

Strugglin, jugglin, got it to the black man
Eatin the scams like I was motherfuckin Pac Man
Cops step off, you know the flavor
They fear the ruffneck niggaz with the lunatic behavior
And now we gotta eat, gotta make ends meet
Stabbin for a fee, it gets hard on the fuckin' streets
It's like a madness, fuck making gravy
I rhyme and do crimes, 'cause either way pays me
A little rough with a hardcore... theme
Couldn't rough something rougher in your... dreams
Mad rugged so you know we're gonna... rip
With that roughneck nigga named 2Pacalypse
Representing YG'z yo
Flip Stretch Homicide and my nigga Gambino
Seek and Po can't forget Money Bags
Stickin up spots and jumpin' in Jags
Gotta get ahead and always stay bumblin
And always keep a hand on the gat
'Cause a niggaz straight strugglin

Chorus (Rakim):
Stick up, stick up, stick up kids...
Still don't nothin' move but the money (2x)

Verse Two: Live Squad

I used to be on tour, but now I'm sick of strugglin
I thought about bumpin, but mother-fuck jugglin
I know it lasts longer, gets my pockets thicker
But I'd rather use my gun 'cause I get the money quicker, so bust it
Look as I cut the records hard to eject
A quick clip threw my body down uh! it's another hit
I got energy to blast now you want the task here
'Cause of the light a motherfucker shot that ass up
But rugged and rough is how I'm steppin
Mac is the weapon, and it's always kept in
Eye on the Mac cause the dog got it goin' on
If you come up steppin you'll be lit like a hick
So you better chill, 'cause I got too much money to get
A street thug in the motherfuckin house, I'm strugglin
Get drunk but I don't think
I'm just in it for the money, don't be a punk snitch
When I yank up my gun, don't run don't bitch
Cause ya know if you do, you'll be layin in a ditch
You'll get your stupid ass blown out the frame
'Cause I'm playing to win, and survive in the game
I'm strugglin

Chorus (Rakim):
Stick up, stick up, stick up kids...
Still don't nothin' move but the money (2x)

Verse Three: 2Pac

Big up, big up, got him in the frame, bang
Ain't nothin' changed set it off I let the brains hang
Guess who's back, to put niggaz on they back
Till I call back, niggaz runnin' free better fall back
I'm fifty niggaz deep beat sleep
With a Mossberg wrapped in my seats
Three deep in my Jeep chief run with the Young Gunz
Strugglin and strivin, that's how the dough come
Now get gunned by the one with the gun for the low goal
Throw a bolo so low when I flow yo
Much too high to read the signs, I'm blind
Clickin on the nine, out to get mine
I go big up, big up, gotta make the room, boom
Blowin' motherfuckers to the moon
Niggaz need to feel me a real G, home from the bumblin
See me on the block, strugglin
And rollin' with the roughnecks nuff checks cashed
I get in niggaz ass, blast
Straight strugglin

Chorus (Rakim):
Stick up, stick up, stick up kids...
Still don't nothin' move but the money (Repeats)
Guess who's back?

(2Pac)
Drop the drums, here it comes, only got
Two minutes to bounce, and every second counts
Better press, wreck on your tech, here we go, set pass the Moet
My trickery's more slippery when wet
Wicked as I flip, don't trip, get a grip
It'll kick, if the bass line's thick, it's a hit
Everybody's got a mic now, it's like a hobby
But more like a job, cause bootleggers tryin' to rob me
And little man wants to be a rap, star
Make papes, hit skins, drive a fat car
It ain't easy, sleazy even
Deceivin those we, believe in
No benefits, just tricks and chicks
Knock a pig to pick, so here's a stick to lick
I shoot a gift, till there ain't none left
And if I find that the track sound deaf
I catch wreck till I lose my breath
That's how it goes in the land of broke
I dispose of those, rock shows, and collect my dough
Now I suppose I'm the bad guy, why?
I say, Hi, and try to stay high
Life's a mess don't stress, test... of givin'
But be thankful that you're livin'... blessed
Guess who's back, comin' back with the track supplied
By Special Ed and Ak, comin' right and exact
I'm fightin it back, now snap, where they at?
When it's time to go to combat, guess who's back

Chorus: repeat 4X

Yes I'm back -> Special Ed
Tupac is ... back!

(2Pac)
Drop the drums, here it comes, only got
One minute to bounce, and every second counts
I went from hustlin dicks, to makin' hits, bustin' flicks
Now I'm sure to be rich for ninety-six
I pull my 'capes on tapes, and make, papes
Trace the bass, to the tape with the baddest bass to date
I try to shake it but the pace is hard to break
Good thoughts I wait, 'cause they hate my black take
Yeah, it's on, and it's packed in the rap race
But if ya got a black face, it's a rat race
I struggle to be rugged and raw, Dukes
Tryin' to survive in the trials and lawsuits
Everybody wants to test me, why me?
No lie, nuckas cried when they try me
Givin' up the roughness, justice
I'ma bust as I'm rippin up 'nuff hits
And guess who's back? No longer trapped
'Cause I snapped on the ones that held me back, feel the contact
Ride the track, get I grip as I flip
Ghetto wickedness I kick, guess who's back?


Yes I'm back, 'cause I never did front -> cut 'n' scratched
I got a head, but ain't no screws in it.

Roll up and get swoll up.
Hold up.
How ya gonna play me like a sunkin dunkin donut?
I ain't came a long way to get checked
So give me respect when I get wreck or
Get your motha fuckin' chimp check.
Once again, it's your friend outta Oakland.
Hoping I rock the shit to get ya open.
Say your looking for some real shit.
Then catch a funkdified batch.
Like that!
Oakland's on the map.
Tupac is on the big screen strivin.
Gotta love a nigga for survivin.
I wear alot of old schools jewels.
Look how the fools ??. Ooh.
Stop lookin' at me hard 'cause your buffer.
But I'll just buck then bigger motha fuckas.
Turnin' men to suckas.
Niggas wanna start a little ruckus.
Better duck 'cause I'll be poundin them motha fuckas.
They wanna throw their hands up. That's tight.
Hit 'em wit my eight. Never had shit left, right.
Then hit 'em wit the uppercut. Duck quick.
Shit outta luck. Fucked and stuck with that rough shit.
Fuck a pop song, fuck a video, fuck Arsenio, fuck the radio.
Do you hear me though?
Give a holla to my niggas in the pen.
And my murderous partners with their Mac 10's.
I represent the real 'cause I'm ill, G.
Glock cocked and then they kill me.
I'm representin'.

I got a head, but ain't no screws in it.
Strictly Representin
I got a head, but ain't no screws in it.

Yeah Stricly Representin
1 motha fucka, 2 motha fucka, 3 motha fuckas,
Damn, who did I forget?

But ain't no screws in it
I'm a soulja.
Daddy was a soulja.
Strong in the struggle.
Must contend so it's on.
Raised in a house full of bad motha fuckas.
Mad motha fuckas.
Never had so we grab from the stacked motha fuckas.
Now they know me, the homies.
Raised by some crazed ass well paid OG's.
Ah shit!
Pulled up in a benzy, snatch.
The wheel as I peel out. Catch a cop's tail.
Rock shells hit. Raise a fist so they know to make a hit.
Can I flip it? I may get wicked as I rip it.
Huh. To get specific: If the shoe fits, then kick it.
It's for the gifted. Pump your fist if you wit it.
Here's your ticket to see Mr. Wicked rip shit.
Now they wanna maime me.
(Told ya)
All I wanted to be was a soulja.
Bang bang boogy it's stick up.
Quit now nigga, eat a dick up.
I'm representin
Little somethin' for my godson Elijah and a little girl named Corrine

Verse One:

Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
I give a holler to my sisters on welfare
Tupac cares, if don't nobody else care
And uh, I know they like to beat ya down a lot
When you come around the block brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive but don't forget, girl keep your head up
And when he tells you you ain't nuttin don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you you should leave him
Cause sista you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas ya up, I just call 'em how I see em
You know it makes me unhappy (what's that)
When brothas make babies, and leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies, that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up
I know you're fed up ladies, but keep your head up


Ooh child things are gonna get easier
Ooh child things are gonna get brighter

Ooh child things are gonna get easier
Ooh child things are gonna get brighter

Verse Two:

Aiyyo, I remember Marvin Gaye, used to sing ta me
He had me feelin' like black was tha thing to be
And suddenly tha ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew, and had a smoke or two
And I realize momma really paid the price
She nearly gave her life, to raise me right
And all I had ta give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic, and make it to tha bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay tha rent
And in the end it seems I'm headin for tha pen
I try and find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems tha rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up, and still keep from gettin' wet up
You know it's funny when it rains and pours
They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor
They say there ain't no hope for the youth and the truth is
There ain't no hope for tha future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother, for turning my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive, 'cause it's a setup
And even though you're fed up
Huh, ya got to keep your head up


Verse Three:

And uh
To all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by ya lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids, even if nobody else want em
'Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and comeback for more
Cause ain't nuttin worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
Hell of a hand without a man, feelin' helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dying inside, but outside you're looking fearless
While tears, is rollin' down your cheeks
Ya steady hopin things don't fall down this week
'Cause if it did, you couldn't take it, and don't blame me
I was given this world I didn't make it
And now my son's getten older and older and cold
From havin' the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin' Benz
I'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin friends
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up, but
Please... you got to keep your head up
Yo 'Law, is it cool if a nigga just get fucked up for this one?
Yeah, Mr.Fuck-a-Cop is back and I still don't give a fuck yaknahmsayin'
Puffin on this indo, in the studio with my partners out here
Pacific Heights in the house, know what I mean

I was framed, so don't make the same mistake, nigga
You gotta learn how to shake the snakes, nigga
'Cause the police love to break a nigga
Send 'em upstate 'cause they straight-up hate the niggaz

So what I do is get a crew of zoo niggaz
Straight fools into rules and do niggaz
And one-time had enough of me
I'm still raw so the law can't fuck with me

They wanna send me to the pen, punk picture that
I stay strapped motherfuckers better get your gat
It ain't easy bein' me I can't take it
Life as a celebrity ain't everything they make it

And ever since the movies, these hoes try to do me
If they can't screw me, they find a way to sue me
Now, can you picture me coolin' at a night club?
Nothin' but love, but motherfuckers wanna mean mug

Since I wear a lot of gold, they plot
Don't know what I got and get shot with the hot ones
And aww yeah, I wanna feel guilty
But you punk motherfuckers tried to milk me

You'll get smacked behind the hill with my phone on my pager
It's beepin' while I cut you with my razor
I'm not violent, I'm petrified and nervous

I got no mercy for these niggaz tryin' to serve us
But if you catch me outta pocket, then I'm got
You love to shoot a nigga but you scared to pop a cop, now drop it

Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my niggaz makin' G's

Reflected and disrespected, plus I'm rejected
You're just another rapper who swears he's makin' records
That's what they said whenever I would walk by
I never tripped though always kept my head up high

Eventually, I knew that I would find my way
After the darkest night, always comes a brighter day
And some would say that turned away is all you'll get
I just said, bet, and never let 'em see me sweat

'Cause in the end, I knew that I would have it all
While non-believers were prayin' for my downfall
And some would call and tell me that they wish me well
But in my heart, I'm knowin' that they wish me hell

Yo get a real job, rappin' doesn't pay the rent
I hate the studio 'cause that's where all my money went
Never surrender, it's all about the faith you've got
Don't ever stop, just push it till you hit the top

And if you drop, at least you know you gave your all
Be true to you and that way you can never fall
But beware these backstabbers ain't no joke
Just like a rope, they hang on you until you're broke

And when you're broke, they move onto the next dope
And there you are, can't even pay your car, nope
And when you reminisce, thinkin' how you got dissed

Remember how it felt, and then remember this
Be true to you, believe that there's no one bigger
'Cause they can all suck dick, it's strictly 4 my niggaz

Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my niggaz makin' G's

Listen, this is for the critics if you live up
Pick up my shit or I'll be back doin' stickups
I better see five stars next to my picture
If not Tupac will cop the glock and come knockin' to getcha

I told you once motherfucker I'm a nut
Play me like a butt and you'll be bleedin' when you're fucked
Niggaz know what's up but they be tryin' to hold me down
I'm comin' outta Oaktown, bitch fuck around

And it ain't where you from that makes you hardcore
Nigga, it's the way you throw them thangs in the war
And to the marks that be talkin' all that shit
Screamin' out the next nigga's name like a bitch

And the niggaz that I ran into recently
The motherfuckers at the club that pulled the piece on me
You little bitches should've pulled the fuckin' trigga
Now you live in fear of a heartless-ass, nigga

Mr.Troublesome, niggaz tried to play me with the gat
But like Terminator nigga, I'll be back
Yeah, and I'll be back with a fuckin' army
You tried to harm me, ruh-ring the alarm G!

'Cause most motherfuckers love to act up
Without they backup, when they get jacked up they crack up
It's strictly for my niggaz at the show
So they know, not to play me like a ho-ho, strictly 4 my

Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my niggaz makin' G's

Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my niggaz makin' G's

Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my niggaz makin' G's

Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strict-strict
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strict-strict
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strict-strict
Strictly 4 my niggaz makin' G's

Strictly, strictly, strict-strict, strictly, strictly, strict-strict
Strictly, strictly, strict-strict, strictly 4 my niggaz makin' G's

Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my niggaz makin' G's

Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my niggaz makin' G's
Growing up as an inner city brotha
Where every other had a pops and a motha
I was tha product of a heated lover
Nobody knew how deep it screwed me
And since my pops never knew me
My family didn't know what ta do with me
Was I somebody they despise
Curious look in they eyes
As if they wonder if I'm dead or alive
Poor momma can't control me
Quit tryin' ta save my soul, I wanna roll with my homies
A ticken timebomb
Can't nobody fade me
Packin' a 380
And fiendin' for my mercedes
Suckers scatter
But it don't matter I'm a cool shot
Punks drop from all tha buckshots tha fools got
I'm tired of being a nice guy
I've been poor all my life, but don't know quite why
So they label me a lunatic
Could care less
Death or success
Is what I quest
'Cause I'm fearless
Now tha streetz R Deathrow


('Cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
Tha streetz R Deathrow
('Cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
Tha streetz R Deathrow

I just murdered a man, I'm even more stressed
Wearin' a vest
Hopein' that their aimin' at my chest
Much too young to bite tha bullet
Hand on tha trigga
I see my life before my eyes each time I pull it
I hope I live to be a man
Must be part of some big plan to keep a brotha in tha state
Penn
Counting pennys over tha years
I'd done stacked many
Proven wrong those
Who swore I'd wouldn't live till twenty
Now they gotta cope
Since it's tha only thing I know
It's difficult to let it go
I'm startin' to lose my hair 'cause I worry
Hustlin' to keep from gettin' buried
But now I gotta move away now
Cause these suckers wanna spray where I lay down
My homie lost his family and snapped
Shot up half tha block to bring them back
Tha streetz R Deathrow


('Cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
Tha streetz R Deathrow
('Cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
Tha streetz R Deathrow
('Cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
Tha streetz R Deathrow
('Cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
(Like it ain't nothin')

I'm dangerous
When drunk I only drink beer
Gin makes me sin
Unable to think clear
Heneesee, makes me think my enemy is getting close
Boom boom boom
Got me shooting at a ghost
Some call me crazy
But this is what you gave me
Amongst tha babies, who raised up from tha slavery
I sport a vest and hit tha sess to kill tha stress
Moved out west and I invest in all tha best
Those who test will find a bullet in they chest
Put ta rest
By a brotha who was hopeless
Grow up broke on tha rope of insanity
How many pistols smoking coming from a broken family
I'm sick of being tired
Sick of tha sirens, body bags, and tha gun firing
Tell bush to push tha button 'cause I'm fed
Tired of hearin' these voices in my head
Tha streetz R Deathrow


('Cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')

('Cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')

Tha streetz R Deathrow
('Cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
This goes out to my partners in tha Live Squad
(Like it ain't nothin')
And all my homies out there involved in that 187
Watch your back...
('Cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
There got to be a better way...
('Cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
There's too many of us in tha cemetery
('Cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
I love it when they fear me
Come on, what we gonna do now
('Cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
I love it when they fear me
Tha streetz R Deathrow
Aw yeah, I get around
Still clown with the Underground, when we come around
Stronger than ever

(Tupac)
Back to get wreck
All respect to those who break their neck to keep their hoes in check
Cause oh they sweat a brother majorly
And I don't know why, your girl keeps paging me
She tell me that she needs me, cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me, she squeeze me, lady take it easy!
Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me, I don't want it if it's that easy
Ayo bust it, baby got a problem saying bye bye
Just another hazard of a fly guy
You ask why, don't matter, my pockets got fatter
Now everybody's looking for the latter
And ain't no need in being greedy
If you wanna see me dial the beeper number baby when you need me
And I'll be there in a jiffy
Don't be picky, just be happy with this quickie
But when you learn, you can't tie me down
Baby doll, check it out, I get around

What you mean you don't know? I get around
The Underground just don't stop for hoes, I get around
Still down with the Underground, I get around
Yeah, ayo Shock, let them hoes know

(Shock G)
Now you can tell from my everday fits, I ain't rich
So cease and desist with them tricks (tricks)
I'm just another black man caught up in the mix (mix)
Trying to make a dollar out of fifteen cents (A dime and a nickel)
Just 'cause I'm a freak don't mean that we could hit the sheets
Baby I can see, that you don't recognize me
I'm Shock G, the one who put the satin on your panties
Never knew a hooker that could share me, I get around

(Money B)
What's up love, how you doing? (All right)
Well I've been hanging sanging, trying to do my thang
Oh, you heard that I was banging
Your home girl you went to school with, that's cool
But did she tell you about her sister and your cousin? Thought I wasn't
See, weekends were made for Michelob
But it's a Monday, my day, so just let me hit it, yo
And don't mistake my statement for a clown
We can keep in the down low long as you know, that I get around

(Tupac)
2Pacalypse now don't stop for hoes, I get around
Why I ain't call you? Ha ha, please

Finger tips on the hips as I dip, gotta get a tight grip, don't slip
Loose lips sink ships, it's a trip
I love the way she licks her lips, see me jocking
Put a little twist in her hips 'cause I'm watching
Conversations on the phone till the break of dawn
Now we all alone, why the lights on?
Turn 'em off, time to set it off, get you wet and soft
Something's on your mind, let it off
You don't know me, you just met me, you won't let me
Well if I couldn't have it (silly rabbit) why you sweating me?
It's a lot of real G's doing time
Cause a groupy bit the truth and told a lie
You picked the wrong guy baby if you're too fly
You need to hit the door, search for a new guy
'Cause I only got one night in town
Break out or be clown, baby doll are you down?
I get around

(Shock G)
Round and round, round we go (Repeat 8x)
Daddy's home...

(2Pac)
Heh, so??
You say that like that means somethin' to me
You've been gone a mighty long motherfuckin time
For you to be comin' home talkin' that "daddy's home" shit (nigga)
We been gettin' along fine just without you
Me, my brother, and my mother
So if you don't mind, you can step the FUCK off, POPS... fuck you!

(2Pac)
Had to play catch by myself, what a sorry sight
A pitiful plight, so I pray for a starry night
Please send me a pops before puberty
The things I wouldn't do to see a piece of family unity
Moms always work, I barely see her
I'm startin to get worried without a pops I'll grow to be her
It's a wonder they don't understand kids today
So when I pray, I pray I'll never grow to be that way
And I hope that he answers me
I heard God don't like ugly well take a look at my family
A different father every weekend
Before we get to meet him they break up before the week ends
I'm gettin' sick of all the friendships
As soon as we kick it he done split and the whole shit ends quick
How can I be a man if there's no role model?
Strivin to save my soul I stay cold drinkin' a forty bottle
I'm so sorry...

I'm so sorry
For all this time (I'm so sorry)
For all this time
For all this time (don't lie)
I'm so sorry
For all this time (so, sorry)
For all this time
For all this time, so sorry baby!

(Wycked)
Moms had to entertain many men
Didn't wanna do it but it's time to pay the rent again
I'm gettin' a bit older and I'm startin to be a bother
Moms can't stand me 'cause I'm lookin' like my father
Should I stay or run away, tell me the answer
Moms ignores me and avoids me like cancer
Grow up rough and it's hard to understand stuff
Moms was tough cause his poppa wasn't man enough
Couldn't stand up to his own responsibilities
Instead of takin' care of me, he'd rather live lavishly
That's why I'll never be a father;
Unless you got the time it's a crime don't even bother
(That's when I started hatin' the phony smiles
Said I was an only child)
Look at mama's lonely smile
It's hard for a son to see his mother cry
She only loves you, but has to fuck with these other guys
I'm so sorry...

I'm so sorry
For all this time
For all this time
For all this time
I'm so sorry
For all this time
For all this time (so sorry)
For all this time, so sorry baby!

(2Pac)
Man child in the promised land couldn't afford many heroes
Moms was the only one there my pops was a no-show
And oh -I guess ya didn't know
That I would grow to be so strong
Lookin' kinda pale, was it the ale oh pops was wrong
Where was the money that you said, you would send me
Talked on the phone and you sounded so friendly
Ask about school and my welfare
But it's clear, you ain't sincere hey who the hell cares
You think I'm blind but this time I see you comin', Jack
You grabbed your coat, left us broke, now ain't no runnin' back
Ask about my moms like you loved her from the start
Left her in the dark, she fell apart from a broken heart
So don't even start with that "wanna be your father" shit
Don't even bother with your dollars I don't need it
I'll bury moms like you left me all alone G
Now that that I finally found you, stay the Fuck away from me
You're so sorry...

I'm so sorry (so sorry)
For all this time (so, so sorry)
For all this time (I'm so so sorry)
For all this time (fuck that!)
I'm so sorry
For all this time (no)
For all this time (so sorry)
For all this time, so sorry baby!

(Tupac - impersonating his father)
I never meant to leave but I was wanted
Crossed too many people every house I'd touch was haunted
Had to watch the strangers every brother was in danger
If I was to keep you breathin, had to be out of range-a
Had to move, one to lost my name and pick the number
Made me watch my back I had no happy home to run to
Maybe it's my fault for being a father livin' fast
But livin' slow, mean half the dough, and you won't get no ass
Hindsight shows me it was wrong all along
I wanted to make some dough so you would grow to be so strong
It took a little longer than I thought
I slipped, got caught, and sent to jail by the courts
Now I'm doin' time and I wish you'd understand
All I ever wanted was for you to be a man
And grow to be the type you was meant to be
Keep the war fightin by the writings that you sent to me
I'm so sorry...

(Chorus w/ variations till end
Yeah hehehahaha, we goin' platinum nigga! Plaahahatinum.

(Stretch)
Yeah, you got the Live Squad in this motherfucker
We got my nigga Treach from Naughty by Nature in this motherfucker
My nigga Apache up in this motherfucker

(Verse One: 2Pac)
My Mossberg goes boom, gimme room, can I catch it
Talkin' quick and then I vic just tryin' to keep from gettin' blasted
I had enough I put a hit upon them bastards
Boo-yaa! Turned a snitch into a casket
Now they after me, prowling for a niggaz bucks
Time to see, who's the G, with the bigger nuts
Buck buck, big up and livin' reckless
Niggaz with a death wish step in with a Tec and I'll wet this
Yeah this shit is hyper
Two to one I'm writing representing and I'm striking like a viper
Huh, I got my mind made up, I got my nine
Ring the alarm, and strong arm must run
Some niggaz need to feel me with a passion
I'm old fashioned, run up on me nigga and get blasted
With five deadly venomz

(Stretch)
Yeah 'Pac, fuck that, still hittin 'em up with
That old deadly shit. Aiyyo Treach where you at?
Step up and hit they ass up with the wickedness.

(Verse Two: Treach)
We come to hit you with a sock full of Brooklyn
To the Onyx of your nose, punk is funky like skunk blunts
Stunk like funk cunt
I come to take you on a war rough and rugged route
And if another doubts I blow your fuckin' mother out
And that's the street scarred style
I shout I'm-de-MC-wit-de-nasty-mouf, and kick the bitch out
Sue me? I pay the lawyer for ya oh boy yeah
Plus my style's ten to twenty fuckin' pounds more
I take you quicker than a picture of a punk ya pickin' shit
Pickin' pockets with a razor stoppin' Russian rockets
Not shoplift, I'm liftin shop
Once you sound hot, 'cause if you ain't a perfect ten
My sign is stop!
It's twenty mother-crooked-fuckin' styles in em
Like women I did 'em I'm in for deadly ready venom

(Verse Three: Majesty of Live Squad)
Yeah, as I take a puff I get rough, Big Maj
To put it on, can't none come tougher see
I'm down with the sound of the Squad hard, boom!
Breakin 'em down, I make 'em see their doom
Coming straight from the dome where I roam it's a job to
Rob and steal and runnin' from the coppers
Who hold a, boulder, turn the gun controller
Started from a punk now to be a high roller
Youngest, reckless, crazy, disaster
Mac-11 blaster, and I run faster
Than a lot of cops I can't be stopped till my head gets popped
A lot of fuckin' bodies will drop
It's a disaster, I'm coming for the blood splatter
I make you scatter, leavin' trails of brains and bladders
Blowin' 'em out the frame with no shame
Game tight, drop a body then get out of sight
Count my loot after I shoot, leave my kicks up and it's
Something I don't wanna do, somethin' that I never did
I try to get him, I think I hit em, I lit him
He's out! A poison, a deadly venom

(Stretch)
Yeah Maj, fuck that! You know how we do.
KnowhatI'msayin? Squad in effect, YG'z in effect.
Now you know a nigga like me gotta represent

(Verse Four: Stretch of Live Squad)
Once again, back to rip shit, quick on the flip tip
The psycho, represent the real to take the mic flow
Deadly, rock a head G, check the melody
Niggaz can't touch me when I wreckin G you better flee
'Cause I'm gifted with a jab and a forty-four Mag
So nigga flip or take a trip in a body bag
Uh, boom you slipped up, now you're zipped up
Yeah one more statistic, fronted and got ripped up
No joke, you be yolk, no matter how it sound
We're taking over eight niggaz back to the stomping grounds
Line 'em up single file, dome runnin' in em
A nigga hit 'em with the venom, the fourth deadly venom

(Stretch)
Nigga, yaknowhatI'msayin? Fuck that!
I told you, we takin' over, yo 'Pac.

(Verse Five: 2Pac)
Five deadly venomz verse five be the livest
Strugglin and strive, keep a nine in my waistline
Take mine, you better bury me, G
Punk ass niggaz don't even worry me, see
I got a glock that say 'Pac run the block
Fuck the cops cause my gauge gets me... PAID
As I sit and reminesce about the old days
Hugging on my AK, fuck getting played, hey
I say niggaz need to get they mind right
Until they do I pop a clip and grip my nine tight
Now it's on everday could be my last day
That's why I blast on they ass as I past let the glass spray
First you had a mouth full of fronts
Now you're mouth's full of chunks, Pac's out puffin blunts
Deadly venomz

(Stretch)
Hahaha, yeah pass that shit over here.
Apache bout to clean shit up.

(Verse Six: Apache)
Throw up your middle finger! Start the track for the maniac
Only thing I'm givin' out is black donuts and dirty backs
Let me tell how you rough I get
I pop shit behind your back get in your face and pop the same shit
You can't get in because my gate's bigger I'ma snake nigga
My act guards me so hard I pull the fuckin' trigger
I'm a section to clinch your porch is like a pinch
Test a rhyme I'll knock your hairline back an inch
Fuckin' up pooh-butts, cut 'em like cold cuts
Choke 'em with my boot lace, then leave 'em hangin' like old nuts
Clip up and move out, time to get em
That's the results of fuckin' with the fifth venom in denim

(Stretch)
Yeah, yaknowhatI'msayin?
Five motherfuckin deadly venomz, in effect for ninety-three
Ninety-four ninety-five all that other shit.
We takin' this motherfucker over this larger hit.
YaknowhatI'msayin? Follow us, come along. YaknowhatI'msayin?
We takin' this motherfucker over. TRUST. We out.
(Yeah)
Bury me a G
Thug Life for life

(2pac)

Thinkin' back
Reminiscing on my teens
A young G
Gettin' paid over dope fiends
Fuckin' off cash that I make
Nigga, what's tha sense of workin hard
If you never get to play
I'm hustlin'
Stayin' out till it's dawn
And commin' home
At 6 o'clock in tha mornin'
Hand's on my glock
Eye's on tha prize
Finger on tha trigga when a nigga ride
Shootin' craps
Bustin' niggas out tha door
Pick my money off tha floor
God bless tha trife folks
Stuck on full, drunk again
Sippin' on Gin
With a couple of friends
Sayin' them thug life niggas be like major pimps
Stickin' to tha rules is what made it simp (Biatch)
And if I die
Let it be
But when they come for me
Bury me a G

I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my mothafucken riches
Even when I die
They won't worry me
Mama don't cry
Bury me a G

(Mopreme Shakur)

More Trouble than tha average
Just made 25 and I'm livin' like a savage
Bein a G ain't no easy thing
Cause you could fuck around get crossed
And get stuck in tha game
And for tha rest of your life you will sit and reminicse
Wonder why it had to end like this
And to tha G's you can feel my pain
Till tha mothafucka gets born again

(The Rated R)
You thought I was a game kid
I'm not tha nigga for playin' games
I let my buckshots rang
When I pull tha trigga on my gauge
I'm on a rampage
Makin' runs for tha devil
Ain't nothin' on my mind
But gettin' in some trouble
I'm tryin' to ride
No more loves
For me hard to figure
Get a nigga for some blunts
Or in some jewelry store (break that shit)
I gives a fuck nigga
Stuck outta luck
When I bust
Put me to my death
But I'm a G till the end of me

I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my mothafucken riches
Even when I die
They won't worry me
Mama don't cry
Bury me a G

(Big Syke)
I got nothin' ta loose so I choose to be a killer
Went from bangin' and slangin'
Now I'm a dope dealer
All my life paid tha price to be tha boss
Back in school
Broke tha rules I'm getten' tossed
Poppin' rocks on tha block was a past time
Pack a 9 all the time
You wanna test mine?
Don't cry
I die before they play me
From tha cradle to tha grave
Bury me

Straight up
Kickin' it with tha homies in tha hood
Gettin' drunk, smokin' blunts
A bitch said I'm no good
I gives a fuck
I spend my time in a dope spot
Never had no time for no bitch
Just slangin' rocks
And bustin' caps on your punk ass marks
Fake ass G's
Bitch niggaz with no heart
I'm stayin' real till I'm 6 feet deep
So when a nigga gone
Bury me a G

I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my mothafuckin riches
Even when I die
They won't worry me
Mama don't cry
Bury Me a G

(2pac)
Stuck on Full
Tangaray got a nigga high
Lord knows I don't need another DUI
I led a Thug Life
Heartless hustler
Just 'cause I fucked
Don't mean I trust her
Now my pagers vibratin'
Can't sleep
So I'm mobbin' to tha ho's house
Pumpin' Isely
Is it cool ta fuck is what I'm askin
Bitch recognize game and start laughin'
When I'm all in those guts and shit (Nigga you crazy)
Prayin' that a nigga don't nut too quick
'Cause I'll fuck and get up and let ya know
I'll be a 10 minute brotha for a $2 ho
Lots a ho's get mad and shit
I let a trick be a trick
You can have that bitch
'Cause I doubt if I change
Tha games a mothafucker
Real niggas turn ta bustas
Bury Me a G

I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta Keep my mind on my mothafucken riches
Even when I die
They won't worry me
Mama don't cry
Bury me a G (6x)

I ain't got time for bitches
Bitches
(Mopreme)
Just 'cause a nigga come in he got style
Don't think I won't flip it
Don't pull your file
But I got enough bullshit to deal with
I'm rollin' with the thugs so
You must be on drugs to the head
Get your ass break down
Broken half baby
I'm a feelin' like a motherfuckin psychopathic
And if you got beef best leave it in the freezer
I'm no joke
Mopreme straight loc
And you could get smoked
You hook the shit you get stroked
And all of that
And later be back for your motherfuckin dope sack
Kid it ain't the type of day to play doughnut
Don't get your ass sewn up
Why you leakin on my blown out
Hey, you're mixed up like a bowl of nuts
You fuck around and got it twisted up
Boy, don't get it twisted

Don't get it twisted!... (8x)

(Macadoshis)
It's the Macadoshis coming from the dark side
The park side where the O.G.s do ride
Ain't nothing but killers in the park
As many niggas lost they's heart
When my gat sparks
I'll bust a cap in that ass
Don't get it twisted
When I'm on a mission, niggas come with Mishy
You busters gettin' disciplined
And you're comin' up short on your life
When I smoke you with this mac-10
When it's on it's on
Fuck it
I'm makin' niggas kick the bucket when I check em' by inducis
Ain't no think to let my shit spin
You on my shit list hope you got a death wish
I tried to warn you but you missed me
You should have listened motherfucker when I said:
Don't get it twisted!

Don't get it twisted!... (6x)

(Rated R)
Niggas got problems about gettin' shit twisted
They need to stay the fuck out of grown folks business
Kids get a kick out of bumpin their big clips
But don't front no shit that brought no shit that peace started
'Cause I'm a cold hearted rider straight dunkin'
Never through with my streets
Never hurt nobody but my heat
East side brothers don't hear me though
They'd rather get shit twisted and gather like hoes
Bitch make ass niggas when I caught 'em
Couldn't bust a drape if they wanted
They're soft like Charmin
But I don't sweat varmits
I suffer with my black group
Just a one-day murderer
On the motherfuckin Rudy Poop
I snapped his soul, son
Ain't no damn thing funny when I spray your ass with my tongue
And your mommy can't save you now
Cause you got the job twisted up
For fuckin' with a killer

Don't get it twisted!... (8x)

(Fade out)
You can dance at the party and not get whipped

(2pac)
Shit don't stop (2x)

Game rules often slang to the right fools
Heavy hittin' at this motherfucker's straight spittin'
Diggin' deep into your brain while tryin' to explain
Why real niggas need to stick to the game
It's the same got these motherfuckers changin' on me
Jealous-ass player-haters gaming on me
Look out motherfucker homey-G
As in gettin' motherfuckers 'fore they come get me
Get down for the right for the wishes
Fake ass nigga, you in shit, for fightin' over bitches
You call that a player?
Straight-ass sissy
See me at my show nigga miss me
'Cause I ain't tryin' to hear that bullshit
Got a pistol motherfucker better pull quick
And just 'cause I'm rappin' don't mean I ain't scrappin
And if you clip when the shit happens, it don't stop

(Chorus) Shit don't stop...

(Y.N.V)
Now my guess is true
Them thug life niggas is a bull
Everywhere we go
The niggas trippin' at the door
I want to dance with you
You can dance at the party and not get whipped

(Macadoshis)
See the shit don't stop
My 9 goes pop
Your body drip-drop
Throw that ass in a zip-loc

(Rated R)
Now you've been hauled away in a body bag
Get your Sammy D said how your blood got sneeze me

(Macadoshis)
Yo you fuckin' with a thug yo your ass gets plugged
With this hollow-point slugs
With ya under the rug

(Rated R)
That's why my deaf niggas don't play that shit
In thug life niggas be the craziest

(Macadoshis)
So when you think about fuckin' this
You better wear a vest
But it really don't matter
We ain't aimin' at your chest

(Rated R)
Nah we blowin' holes in your motherfuckin' skull
Make sure your ass is smoked
That's all the fat lady wrote

(Macadoshis)
You heard that fat bitch sing when my shit went bang-bang
But it don't pay when I flaunt your brain

(Rated R)
Nigga, ain't no plain cane brothers come no show
In the casket
Git'n they ass kicked
And blasted

It don't stop

(Chorus) Shit don't stop...

(Y.N.V)
Now my guess is true
Them thug life niggas is a bull
Everywhere we go
The niggas trippin' at the door
I want to dance with you
You can dance at the party and not get whipped

(Mopreme)
All I wanna do is try to Mac the hoes
Spin bank on thangs sellin me a sponsor on my foes
It's like each and every one they got the look of death
I got my 9 nigga
Don't be silly
You better watch your step

(Syke)
And pussies we crossin when my crew is flossin'
Bitches we tossin'
And niggas we crossin'
It's like a murder rhyme when we hit your hood
It's all good
The punks? I wish you would!

(Mopreme)
Wouldn't better to just corrolate what we bust
Instead of kickin' dust
Gets a press y'all from nuts
Cause ain't no herbs here
And ain't no morgues
Beware of the water 'cause they full of sharks

(Syke)
But in every state
Niggas perpetrate and test
Where I come from fools die for less
And thugs keep thugin' till their casket drop
It's on till I die
And the shit don't stop

(Chorus 2x) Shit don't stop...

(Y.N.V)
Now my guess is true
Them thug life niggas is a bull
Everywhere we go
The niggas trippin' at the door
I want to dance with you
You can dance at the party and not get whipped
Yeah
Pour out a little liquor for your homies, nigga
This one here go out to my nigga Mike Coolie
(Light up a fat one for this one)
How you come up, man?

I started young kickin' dust and livin' rough
You watch you mouth around my mama, you couldn't cuss, man
I had a down ass homie though we ran the streets
And on the scene at the age of fourteen, huh
I packed a nine and my nigga packed a forty-five
We drinkin' forties, lil' shorties livin' naughty lives
You couldn't stop us, long as I got my glock, fuck the coppers
Hangin' on the block, slangin' rocks and makin' profits

I couldn't fuck with the school life, I was a fool
I'll play that motherfucker for a tool man
Tonight'll be the night that's what we figurin'
Hustlin' in the rain felt no pain 'cause we drinkin'
Playin' them hoes like manure
First let my nigga fuck and then I fuck, that's how we do it

It's two niggaz comin' up out the hood
Livin' life just as good as we could
But since a bitch can't be trusted
Hoes snitched to the police, now my nigga's busted
The cops whoopin' on my nigga in jail
Tryin' to get a motherfucker to tell
And couldn't nobody diss my nigga
Damn, I miss my nigga, pour out a little liquor

My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go

This goes out to all you so called G's
Pour out a little liquor for your real motherfuckin' partners
Don't let the drink get like that y'all, huh
Pour out a little liquor, pour out a little liquor
What's that you drinkin' on?

Drinkin' on gin, smokin' on blunts and it's on
Reminisce about my niggaz, that's dead and gone
And now they buried, sometimes my eyes still get blurry
'Cause I'm losin' all my homies and I worry
I got my back against a brick wall, trapped in a circle
Boxin' with them suckers till my knuckles turn purple
Mama told me, "Son, there'll be days like this"
Don't wanna think so, I hit the drink and stay blitzed

We had plans of bein' big time G's
Rolling in marked cars, movin' them keys
And now I roll up the window, blaze up some indo
Get to' down for my niggaz in the pen, yo
Your son's gettin' big and strong
And I'd love 'em like one of my own, till you come home
And the years sure fly with the quickness
You do the time, and I'll keep handlin' yo' business

That's the way it's supposed to be
Homie, if it was me, you'd do the shit for me
Homie, I can remember scrapin' back to back
Throwin' dogs on them suckers runnin' up on this young hog
I hope my words can paint a perfect picture
And let ya know how much a nigga miss ya
Pour out some liquor

My cousin died last year and I still can't let go

Look at you
Drinkin' got you where you don't even give respect to your partners
Pour out some liquor, nigga
It ain't like that, tip that shit over
Pour out a little liquor

My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go

This for my nigga Madman, Dagz, Hood, Silk, yeah
A little liquor for my homies y'all
We in this motherfuckin' piece, yeah
Pour out a little liquor, Young Queen, yeah
This one goes out to all my mack partners
Back in the motherfuckin' Bay

Oaktown still in the motherfuckin' house
(Pour out a little liquor)
My nigga Richie Rich, Gov'na
(I don't care, Night train, Hennessey)
All my real motherfuckin' partners
(Pour out a little liquor)
And all my real partnas in Marin, fuck you busta ass niggaz
Yeah nigga, pour out a little liquor
(Tupac)

Yah nigga, Drop the top on your muthafuckin ride
This how we do it on the west coast BAABBBY

Rollin' down the Four O Five
Gettin' high
White boys done wrecked their shit
Tryin' to check my ride
I ain't being bootsy
Crusin' in a Six-o Impala
Drivin' like I'm in a Hooptee
Car full of ballin' caps
Keep yo hand on the strap
And take all the craps
Niggas know my steel-lo
All legit
But I'm drapped
Like a nigga movin' kilo
Shit don't stop
'Cause I can make that ass drop
Make the front pop
And Hit the three wheel motion
All Day
Hit the freeway
Take it easy, uh
Let's slide
And pick-up some hoochies
Ride
Right back to the movies
High
Talking back to the screen drinkin' liquor
Havin' big dreams of gettin' richer
I'm livin' that

Chorus (4x) (Tupac)

Thug Life, y'all know the rules
Gotta do whatcha gotta do (Stay True)

Big Stretch represent the real nigga
Flex, Live squad and this mutha fucker catch wreck

(Stretch)
Thug Life
Sharp as a roughneck
Shakin' the dice, we roll long, ain't nothin' nice
So the vice wanna follow us around (raize up)
Got 'em runnin' as we clown through the town (blaze up)
Another one, had to throw another gun
Don't need another case
You can see it on my face son
But I ain't fallin' yet
And I gotta give a shout to where my ball is at

(Tupac)

Mophreme Tell 'em why the hoes dream
Gettin' high off a nigga like a dope fiend

(Mophreme)

'Cause I'm non-stop, and I'm always hustlin'
Twenty four seven, ain't nothin' buck
But when a young G's flippin keys for a livin'
Try to make a mill off the time I'm givin'
Trippin'
Mad
I'm crazy
Can't nobody fade me
And I been goin' insane lately
And everybody tryin' ta hold me back
I'm about to snap
You better move back
You know I led a...

Chorus (4x) (Tupac)

Thug Life, y'all know the rules
Gotta do whatcha gotta do (Stay True)

Maaaannnn, I don't worry about the Five-O
If they start,
'Cause it's all about survival
Just stay smart
Keep your mind on your bank roll
Always
Stay ahead of these stank hos
These days
It's an all out rat race
And look at MEEE just caught another cat case
That makes three
My laywers getting cash up the ass
Don't even ask
Why I'm buck wild?
Don't smile
Don't laugh
To the young G's comin' up
Peep game
Don't let the money make you change
Or act strange
Stay broke
It's all in together now
Keep pumping loud
Till the crowd
Bring the top down
Is that Tupac Thug Life?
Hell Yah
Try to dirty up my name
But it's still here
Which way do I turn?
I'm strapped
Lost in the storm
I can't turn back
With that...

Chorus (4x) (Tupac)

Thug Life, y'all know the rules
Gotta do whatcha gotta do (Stay True)

(Tupac)
Under Pressure
Yeah, Baby
When tha pressures on...
Thug Life
When it's on it's on

(Tupac)
One of these days I'll learn
Don't fuck with trick ass niggas
'Cause they turn into bitch ass niggas
I'm sick of bein stuck in tha county jail
My niggas clown, bring a pound
When they posten bail
Smokin' blunts in tha driveway
My four-five screamin fuck tha police
Won't fly away, thug, till I die
You wonder why I'm made this way
I wasn't, turned out
I was raised this way of thinkin'
These are tha dreams of a young teen
Sceam, and stack green on tha crack fiends
One time can't hold me one of these days
We gotta bust back for tha homies
Locked down in tha penitentry
Finally loose my mind if tha pigs succeed
Stress, smoken weed and nicoteen
But what a nigga really need is Thorozine
Right before I die I'll be curseing tha law
Reincarnated bitch even worse than before
My four-four's givin' payback
My underhanded plan
To get them niggas while they laid back
And big stretch hit tha scene with tha mini 14
Servin' suckers like dope fiends
And lead tha whole team

Under Pressure Nigga
That's right

(Stretch)
Never run throw your gun in tha air
Oh yeah nigga bust ain't no time to spare
Called tha ruffest mothafucker and we fuck shit up
And with tha stainless steel (???), we cut shit up
Flash and blast a nigga with tha quickness
Cock tha four pound motherfucker when I spit this and rip this
Damn, my mind is in tha depths of hell
But when I'm walking on tha street kid my name rings bells
And I never fell nigga I stand to tall
I'm just a thug motherfucker who was born to brawl, givin' my all
So niggas wanna bring it to me
So I'ma sell my cocain and lay they ass down 'G'

Under Pressure

(Tupac)
Yeah, look here tho

Runnin' wild
I never smiled as a juvenile
Even now I keep a frown when I come around
Don't ask me about tha past, it was all bad
Shots blasted will I last in tha wrong path
In tha dark is where my heart saw tha most grief
Mothafuckers is getten shanked over gold teeth
Am I sick? 'cause I'm addicted to get splifted
Watch tha stupid ass tricks get lifted
Nothens changed cause in tha came it's a steady aim
Fuck friends 'cause when in danger those niggas change
Puff weed and stuff G's in my sock G
Call Ki's and Hennessy where tha glock be
Times passen will I last here another day
I put my gun away and grab my AK
It's getten hectic I can't call it
House full of alcoholics
Now we're niggas under pressure

Yeah, that's right...
Under Pressure, we're niggas under pressure
Yeah

(Tupac and Stretch together repeated 11x)
When tha Pressures on it's a hit
Ski mask
Extra Gats
Bring tha clips
Don't nobody move when we walk tha streets
They stay silent
Cause talk is cheap
(Mopreme)
It was a dope spot front yard, one on one strapping
That's the way it was way before all the scrapping
Earned my fucking props from the G's in the hood
Put in work, did some dirt, never snitched, never would
Rollin' the fat Jaguars with my nigga P blowing up
Time coming back sipping Hennessey
Seventeen years old and I felt like God mad rich
And I had my pick of any fine bitch
And my family was known to be great, seen slightly more
Representing no matter who sets it on
Street power, why you niggaz flip and you thug shit
I be bout my motherfucking grip, nothing else
Gets between me and mine, just remember that
Damn it's a shame, but still I'm in the game
I'm trying to get street fame

I'm a superstar.., I'm a superstar...
I'm a superstar, made it by street fame
I'm a superstar.., I'm a superstar...
I'm a superstar, made it by street fame

(Big Syke)
Don't blame my mama, don't blame my daddy
I know they wish they never had me
In and out of jail by twelve, failing out of school
'Cause I was living by the street rules
Hanging with hogs, dropping dogs as a little loc
I was getting my respect but I was still broke
Into the game and expanded to the cocaine
Went from double-ups, to slanging them whole things
Focused on my mail name ringing like a bell
And even with no proof they gonna put me in jail
Everybody says he's sold and I'm outta control
Motherfuckers gossip but I still roll (nigga)
Bitches want my cash on my dash of my cockpit
They wouldn't know a motherfucker if he didn't have shit
So while I'm balling and kicking up dust, get yo' skull crushed
Bitch-made niggaz know not to fuck with us
'Cause I'm living on the edge, I'm blasting lead
Wanted by the Feds, they got to take me dead
So fuck it drive a bucket in the inner city
In the land of no pity, I made it by the street fame

I'm a superstar.., I'm a superstar...
I'm a superstar, made it by street fame
I'm a superstar.., I'm a superstar...
I'm a superstar, made it by street fame

(The Rated R)
I'm a super star, made it by street fame
I had to make some people feel the pain, in this dirty game
I know I'm on my way to hell
Ain't no yellow bricked road for all the niggas that I done smoked
The hood done took me under, a nigga gots no heart
Don't get it twisted 'cause I'm there with my homey's car
I kill for my niggaz, my niggaz kill for me
That's the love you get, from the drunk one, you put in work see
I'm a G with a gang of niggaz after me
Trying to peal me, 'cause I smoked they homey
What comes around goes around is what makes it worse
I smoke blunts all day to keep my mind off a hearse
They don't stop stop till my casket drop drop
Let me ride, but all I want, thou shalt not beef or die
And it don't matter if I rap or plays
'Cause I blow out back of some minds, fuck the fame

I'm a superstar.., I'm a superstar...
I'm a superstar, made it by street fame
I'm a superstar.., I'm a superstar...
I'm a superstar, made it by street fame

... Made it by street fame
(Repeat to the end)
From tha Cradle to the Grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto. Ooh
From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.

June 16,1971
Mama gave birth
To a hell raisin' heavanly son.
See the doctor tried to smack me
But I smacked him back,
My first words were thug for life
And Papa pass the Mak.
I'm bustin' on these motha fuckas ballin'
Listen you can hear my mini 14 callin'.
From out the window of my drop top
I got my glock cocked
Bustin' at niggas
When will it stop?
Now tell me are you scared of the dark?
Can't close my eyes I see visions
But even with this thug livin'
Will I escape prison?
Penitentiary chances was an all day thang
The only way to advance
And if you slang
Then you'd better have your nikes on
'Cause when we fight
It's in the middle of the night with no lights on.
Hey!
There must be a God 'cause I feel lucky,
Paranoid out my mind...
This muthafucka's tryin' to rush me.
Am I goin' to jail?
Look at me bailin'
Commin' out the court house
All about the male man
Never, never die
Be a hustlah mothafuckas
And makin' thugs out you suckas.
From the cradle to the grave.

From the cradle to the grave, life ain't nevah been easy
Living in the ghetto.
From the cardle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.

From the cradle to the grave
Since a little bitty child
I've been known to get ill and kinda buck wild.
Pop pop!
Just like the part that's in my walk with street talk
I'm runnin' up the block in the dark with less spark.
Surveillance on a nigga every day,
Waitin' on my daddy just to take his ass away.
Now Mama always workin' tryin' to make ends meet.
So now a young nigga bein' raised by the streets.
And then the on other one that ever showed me love
Was my dope fiend uncle strung out on drugs
A straight thug.
Just me, my mama out here on our own
So I got two gatts
One black and one of chrome.
Now I don't wanna hurt nobody but I must defend mine!
It's all the fuck I got
So stop and walk a thin line.
Young niggas be brave
And keep on thuggin' from the cradle to the grave,
From the cradle to the grave.

From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.

From the cradle to the grave, I'm glad to say
I made it this far.
Many G's died hard
And all they got was their name here up on a wall.
It's sad thinkin' about the times
Life goes on, I'm steady lost in this land...
As the warzone I got no home
Don't have no friends neither.
It's just me by my lonely so I married my nina.
I keeps her wherever I go,
I love my hoe.
Never leave home without my sugar.
I'm hafta plug a nigga.
Mama told me not to trust no punks,
And kick his ass if he lay a hand on me.
Since then I been known.
Sometimes I think my own self stupid
'Cause I stay shootin' at marks,
Get twisted up in police reports.
Since the cradle, I've been ungreatful.
My first toy was a gun
I got sprung and learn to love weapons.
But now I'm through with money
And through with street fame.
Somebody peeled my cap and put me in my grave.

From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.
From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.

March 18th
A rainy day my mama gave birth
To a baby boy trapped in hell on Earth.
From day one it wasn't fun I never had a crumb.
Daddy worked two jobs and Mama won't stop drinkin' rum.
I tried to cope loc
But my family's broke
And my pocket's short
So now I gotta sling dope.
In a game filled with pain it's a fuckin' shame,
The white man got a motha fucka slingin' cane.
So now it's on from dusk to dawn I get my serve on.
Always in the spot with my glock slingin' rocks at the rocks.
This shit don't stop I'm steady dodgin' cops.
I never flip flop
Hear my glock cock
Thug till I drop.
And if I hit the pen I gotta do my time
Sittin' on my bunk reminiscing about the good times.
It's fucked up a nigga gotta grow up doing dirt,
But from the cradle to the grave I'ma put in work.

From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.
From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.

Time's movin' fast
Will I last another day?
So I pray and I lay with my A.K.
Did I sell my soul as a young kid?
All the things I did
Wishin' someone help me
But they never did.
I can't take it
Will I make it to my older age?
Before I'm shot up or locked up in a fuckin' cage.
Lord help me, guide me, save me!
Cause that's the way my Daddy raised me
Crazy.
Do or die. Nigga pull the triggah don't give a fuck.
You'd rather be in jail than get your ass bucked.
Nobody cares, it's me against the world.
Keepin' murdah on my mind and my tech-9.
I got nothin' to lose, payin' dues, nigga you wanna die?
I get high
Then my mission is a walk-by.
You better jet when I hit your set 'cause I'm commin'.
Start runnin' yellin' evil mind as I'm gunnin'.
One in the chamber for the anger that I build inside,
For the mothers that cried, for my homies that died.
The beginning is an ending, am I just a slave?
So I got to be brave from the cradle to the grave.

Chorus till fade
I would share the definition of ballin' with you white folks...
But now...
The game is to be sold and not told
So eh, fuck me

(Tupac)
I'm up before the sunrise, first to hit the block.
Little bad mothafucka with a pocket full of rocks.
Learn to throw them thangs, get my skinny little ass kicked.
And niggas laugh, till tha first mothafucka got blasted.
I put the nigga in his casket,
Now they coverin' the basket with plastic.
I smoke blunts on a regular buck when it counts.
I'm tryin' to make a million dollars outta quarter ounce.
And gettin' ghost on the five-o, fuck them hos.
Got a 45 screamin' about survival.
Hey nigga can I lay low, cook some yay-yo.
Hollar one-time when I say so.
Don't want to go to the pen, I'm hittin' fences.
Narcs on a nigga's back, missin' me by inches.
And they say how do you survive weighin' 165
In a city where the skinny niggas die?
Tell Mama don't cry.
Even when they kill me,
They can never take the game from a young G.
I'm str8 ballin'!

Str8 ballin'!

Still on parole and I'm the first nigga servin'
Pour some liquor on the curb for my niggas that deserve it.
But if I want to make a million, gotta stay dealin'.
It's kinda boomin' round the way and today I'll make a killin'.
Dressin' down like a villain', but only on the block.
It's a clever disguise to keep me runnin' from the cops.
Ha, I'm gettin' high. I think I'll die if I don't get no ends.
I'm in a bucket with 'em ridin' it like it's a Benz.
I hate to strip let my music bump,
Drinkin' liquor, and I'm lookin' for some hoes to fuck.
Rather die makin' money than live poor and legal
As I slang another ounce, I wish it was a kilo.
A need money in a major way.
Time to fuck my BEEEYATCH! Hey!, and getten' paid
You other mothafuckas callin',
But me and my mothafuckin' thug niggas,
We str8 ballin'!

Str8 ballin'!

Damned if I don't, and damned if a nigga do.
So watch a young mothafucka pull a trigga just to RAISE UP!
But don't let them see you cry, dry your eyes
Young nigga time to do or die.
I keep a pistol in my pocket,
Ready on my block.
Ain't no time for a nigga to even cock shit.
And now they see that mothafucka beat pain,
At point blank range 'cause he slept on the game.
Ain't a damned thing changed
Shakin' the dice, now roll 'em,
If you can't stand pain better hold 'em.
Cause ain't no tellin' what you might roll.
You might go catch AIDS from a slight cold. Nigga.
Better live your life to the fullest,
You 'bout to kill a fool, got a pistol mothafucka better pull it.
Cause even when they kill me,
They can never take the game from a young G.
We str8 ballin'!

We str8 ballin'!

To my niggas in the penitentiary,
Loked up like a mothafucka when they mention me.
Cause you fuckin' with the realest motha fucka ever born,
And once again it's on,
I'm bustin' on these bitches till they gone.
Who the hell can you get to stop me?
I'm in the projects, parlaying with my posse.
I keep my glock cocked
I need it 'cause they're all shady.
I finally made it
Now these jealous bitches tryin' to FADE me!
I ain't goin' out I'd rather blast back.
I'm on the corner with my niggas watchin' cash stack.
And I came up a long way from food stamps.
And takin' shit from the low-life ghetto tramps.
Could you blame me if they sweat me I'm gonna open fire.
What could I do? Pull my trigga or watch my nigga die.
I'm representin' to the fullest givin' devil slugs.
I'm on the block slangin' drugs with the young thugs.
And mothafucka, we be ballin'!
All mothafuckin' day long, stay strong!
We str8 ballin'.
(Reporter)

Good Evening (sirens in the background)
I'm reporting live from Sunset Boulevard
Where many excited fans have gathered with candles
(Crowd starts chanting "Tupac")
Awaiting the much anticipated release, of Tupac Shakur's latest album, Better Dayz
This is yet another post-humorous release by Tupac
Which, raises the question
Where are these songs coming from?
It's interesting how, the message in these songs
Is still relevant today
Even in his death, he's touching people with his lyrics
I can feel the energy in the air, as they count down to midnight
When the album will officially be released
Oh, hold on, I, think they're starting to countdown now

(Crowd)

5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ...

(2Pac) It's just me against the world
(Girl) Ooh, ooh
(2Pac) Nuttin to lose...
It's just me against the world baby
(Girl) Oah, oahhhah
(2Pac) I got nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world
(Girl) Oh-hah
(2Pac) Stuck in the game
Me against the world baby

Verse One: 2Pac

Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in the city, the cops is hot for me
The projects is full of bullets, the bodies is droppin'
There ain't no stoppin' me
Constantly movin while makin' millions
Witnessin killings, leavin' dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Carries to children 'cause they're illin
Addicted to killin' and the appeal from the cap peelin
Without feelin', but will they last or be blasted?
Hard headed bastard
Maybe he'll listen in his casket -- the aftermath
More bodies being buried -- I'm losing my homies in a hurry
They're relocating to the cemetery
Got me worried, stressin, my vision's blurried
The question is will I live? No one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin' this anger
Don't wanna make excuses, cause this is how it is
What's the use unless we're shootin no one notices the youth
It's just me against the world baby

(Girl) Me against the world
(2Pac) It's just me against the world
(Girl) Ooh yeah, ooh-hoo
(2Pac) It's just me against the world
(Girl) Me against the world
(2Pac) 'Cause it's just me against the world baby
(Girl) Hey!
(2Pac) Me against the world
(Girl) Ooh yeah
(2Pac) I got nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world baby
(Girl) I got nothing to lose

Verse Two: Dramacydal

Could somebody help me? I'm out here all by myself
See ladies in stones, Baby Capone's, livin' wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin'
Seein Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons, already crazy
And screamin I guess them nightmares as a child
Had me scared, but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route? For a crooked Outlaw
Veteran, a villain, a young thug, who one day shall fall

Everday there's mo'death, and plus I'm dough-less
I'm seein mo' reasons for me to proceed with thievin
Scheme on the scheming and leave they peeps grieving
Cause ain't no bucks to stack up, my nuts is backed up
I'm bout to act up, go load the Mac up, now watch me klacka
Tried makin' fat cuts, but yo it ain't workin
And Evil's lurking, I can see him smirking
When I gets to pervin, so what?
Go put some work in, and make my mail, makin' sales
Risking 25 with a 'L', but oh well

(Girl) Me against the world
(2Pac) With nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world
(Girl) Ooh yeah... ooh-ooh
(2Pac) It's just me against the world baby
(Girl) Me against the world
(2Pac) I got nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world
(Girl) Oahhhoh
(2Pac) Ha ha
It's just me against the world baby
(Girl) Ha-ah, HA-Ah!
(2Pac) With nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world baby
(Girl) Me against the world, hoah
(2Pac) Me against the world
I got nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world baby
(Girl) Ha-hah (hehe) hey!

Verse Three: 2Pac

With all this extra stressin
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest? Through this supression
They punish the people that's askin questions
And those that possess, steal from the ones without possesions
The message I stress: to make it stop study your lessons
Don't settle for less - even the genius asks-es questions
Be grateful for blessings
Don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let the pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference
Politicians and hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nuttin like the game
It's just me against the world

(Girl) Me against the world
(2Pac) Nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world baby
(Girl) Me against the world
(2Pac) Got me stuck in the game
It's just me against the world
(Girl) Oahah
(2Pac) I'd be ashamed to lose
It's just me against the world baby
(Girl) Me against the world

Outro: 2Pac

Heh, hahahahahahah
That's right
I know it seem hard sometimes but uh
Remember one thing
Through every dark night, there's a bright day after that
So no matter how hard it get, stick your chest out
Keep your head up, and handle it

(Girl) Me against the world
Me against the world
Me against the world

Yo Mo Bee main, drop that shit!

Hey! Hey-ayyaahhy

You know what time, boo-yaow
I know it's time for you
So grab one by the hand youknowhatI'msayin
And uh, throw up that finger
Ay yo yo yo throw y'all fingers up!
Thug style baby, Thug style y'know?

Verse One:

Tell me baby are you lonely? Don't wanna rush ya
I can help ya if ya only, let me touch ya
If I'm wrong love tell me, 'cause I get caught up
And the life I live is Hell see, I never thought I'd see
The day when I would calm down, you ain't heard
I've been known to clown and Get Around, that's my word
See you walkin' and you lookin' good, yes indeed
Got a body like a sex fiend, you're killin' me
Witcha attitude to match right, don't be phony
'Cause I hate when you act like, you don't know me
I've be stressin in the spotlight, I want the fame
But the industry's a lot like, a crack game
Ain't no time for commitment, I gotta go
Can't be wit you every minute miss, another show
And even though I'm known for my one night stand
Look here, I wanna be an honest man, but temptations go...

Hey! Hey-ayyaahhy

Throw up the finger!
And all my homies go...
Give them the finger!
Ya know what baby it's like

*Singing*
I know you've been searchin for someone
To make you happy, and get the job done
You say you need it, a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care

Verse Two:

Will I cheat or will I be committed, heaven knows
Gettin' weak and I wanna hit it, so here I go
In my ride and I'm all in, gettin' high
I can hear the people callin, I'm passin by
Everybody knows I'm ball-in, and to God
Gotta keep myself from fall-in, but it's hard
All the cuties know I'm under pressure, what do I do
Gettin' shaky when she pull the dress up, and say it's cool
Should I stroke or should I wait a while, you decide
If you tell me that you don't want it, that's a lie
Move close and let me whisper, some dirty words
In your ears as I kiss ya, on every curve
Slow down baby don't rush, I like it slow
Can't hold it any longer, so let it go
Open the gates, do you wanna fall up in heaven
Don't worry, I let myself in, all I heard was...

Hey! Hey-ayyaahhy

Give 'em the finger!
All my homies go...
Throw your fingers up!
That's just the Thug in me girl, you know
Peep out all my homies, y'know, it's like

*Singing*
I know you've been searchin for someone
To make you happy, and get the job done
You say you need it, a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care

Verse Three:

A lot of people think it's easy, to settle down
Got a woman that'll please me, in every town
I don't wanna but I gotta do it, the temptation
Got me ready to release the fluid, sensation
Sit down and conversate like you know me, take my hand
Cause even Thugs get lonely, understand
Even the hardest of my homies need attention
Catch you blowin' up the telephone, reminiscin
I wanna take you to the movies, and the park
Let's find a spot for you to do me, in the dark
Now that it's passion, hold me tight
Don't need lights, I can see you by the moonlight
I know your man ain't lovin' you right
You're lonely and depressed you need a Thug in your life
Enough talkin', you want me to leave, I'll get to walkin'
See you later, cause baby I'm a player, and all I heard was

Hey! Hey-ayyaahhy

Give 'em the finger
And all my homies go...
Yo this how we gonna do this in the nine-trey y'know?
Throw your fingers up
Y'know?
They gonna peep this, this how we run game on you

*Singing*
Everybody, hey, all right
Hey, heyyyeah, heyyyay, oh

(2Pac)
All my niggaz go
Uptown in the
Give 'em the finger!
Throw your hands up
Give 'em the finger!
I wanna dedicate this one to Robert 'Yummy' Sanderford
And all other lil' young niggaz that's in a rush to be gangstas

As a young nigga, I'm almost swellin in the wind
Give anythang, to be that innocent again, when I was ten
I didn't bang but I was hangin' with the homies
Tell them niggaz started slangin that they don't know me
I got my hustle on, learned to ignore what couldn't pay me
Lately I've been tryin' to make a bill-ion, can you play me
With that jealousy they need to miss me, don't sweat me
If them cowards really want me, come get me, and even I
Someday will die but I'm cautious, I'm fin' to ride
Put down the top, now we flossin
Hit the freeway, let the wind blow, drop the window
Workin with a twenty sack of indo, feelin' good
Stop through the hood, grab the young thugs
And I can't help but reminisce back when we slung drugs, know it's bad
But all we had was our hopes and dreams
Couldn't see unless we learned to slang dope to fiends
As young niggaz

He's the kind of G like everybody knows
As a young nigga
He's always G'd up, from head to toe
My memories as a young nigga
Always got it blown like Al Capone
Young nigga
He's the downest G I've ever known

Back in Junior High, when we was barely gettin' by, when daddy died
That's when my momma started gettin' high
My neighborhood was full of drivebys, couldn't survive
All our homies livin' short lives, I couldn't cry
Told my momma if I did die, just put a blunt in my casket
Let me get my dead homies high
Come follow me throughout my history, it's just
Me Against the World stuck in misery; as a young nigga
My only thing was to be paid
Life full of riches avoid snitched 'cause they shady, back in the days
We always found the time to play,
But that's before they taught them gangbangers how to spray
Not just L.A., but in the Bay and in Chicago and even St. Louis
Every stadium that I go, when will they change?
Stuck in the game like a dumb nigga
Remember how it was, to be a young nigga

He's the kind of G like everybody knows
As a young nigga
He's always G'd up, from head to toe
My memories as a young nigga
Always got it blown like Al Capone
Young nigga
He's the downest G I've ever known

I'm tellin' you...
... To be young, have your brains and have every ? and all that
Yo, y'all niggaz don't know how good you really do got it
Muh'fuckers need to just calm down
And peep what the fuck they wanna do for the rest of the life
'Fore you end your life before you BEGIN your life
You dumb nigga

Now that I'm grown, I got my mind on bein somethin'
Don't wanna be another statistic, out here doin' nuttin
Tryin' to maintain in this dirty game, keep it real
And I will even if it kills me, my young niggaz
Break away from these dumb niggaz
Put down the guns and have some fun nigga, the rest'll come nigga
Fame is a fast thang, that gangbangin
Puttin' niggaz in a casket, murdered for hangin'
At the wrong place at the wrong time, no longer livin'
'Cause he threw up the wrong sign, and every day
I watch the murder rate increases, and even worse
The epidemic and diseases, what is the future?
The projects lookin' hopeless, where
More and more brothers givin' up and don't care
Sometimes I hate when brothers act up, I hit the weed
And I proceed to blow the track up, for young niggaz

He's the kind of G like everybody knows
For these young niggaz
He's always G'd up, from head to toe
My memories as a young nigga
He always got it blown like Al Capone
Take it slow nigga, it's for the young niggaz
He's the downest G I've ever known
As a young nigga

He's the kind of G like everybody knows
He's always G'd up, from head to toe
Memories as a young nigga
He always got it blown like Al Capone
He's the downest G I've ever known

(Pac talking overlaps singing last four lines)
This go out to the young thugs, the have-nots (you know)
Little bad motherfuckers from the block (that's right)
Them niggaz that's thirteen and fourteen
Drivin' Cadillacs, Benzes and shit (I see you boy)
Young motherfuckin hustlers (make that money boy)
Stay strong nigga
You could be a fuckin' accountant, not a dope dealer
YouknowhatI'msayin? (Go to school nigga, go to school)
Fuck around and, you pimpin' out here
You could be a lawyer (really doe)
Niggaz gotta get they priorities straight
(Don't see Johnny Cochran out in this motherfucker)
Really doe... young niggaz... little RahRah (sup nigga)
Especially my little cousins don't be no dumb guy
(Don't be a dumb nigga, listen, young niggaz)

*Singers freestyle and skat to the end of the song*
(Lady Levi)
Oh, you tink life is yours?
Life ain't na somethin' you can rap with
Ooh come na ordinary game
Da game na somethin' you can rap with
Me's a player you know?
I do not, play in no game
Me just, make money, dollars, every time seen?

Verse One: 2Pac

Now how can I explain how this game laced, plus with this fame
I got enemies do anything to break me, my attitude changed
Got to the point where I was driven, twenty-four/seven
Money's my mission, just tryin' to make a livin'
These busta tricks don't want no mail
They spendin they riches on skanless bail
Who'll stay petrified in jail
It's hell, plus all the dealers want a meal ticket
Jealous-ass, playa-hatin' but we still kick it
Always keep my eyes on the prize, watch the police
Seen so much murder, neighborhoods gettin' no sleep
But still, I get my money on major, continuously
Communicatin through my pager, know me
Don't have no homies 'cause they jealous, I hustle solo
'Cause when I'm broke I got no time for the fellas, listen
Ain't nothin' poppin' 'bout no work, I ain't no joke
Fuck what they say and get your dough
(Game's been good to me)
Heavy in the game

(Lady Levi)
Who da bumba claat him a come try take mine?
Ooh, me see you rushin up
(Game's been good to me)
I throw 'I'm blood claat P.M. to A.M.
All, all da bumba come ya take dis ting
For ya take dis ting for joke?
(I don't care what it did to them
The game's been good to me)
Oh! Dat's right

Verse Two: Richie Rich

Well lemme shoot some of this how heavy type of stuff...
Certain wanna stick to the game, yousea trick to the game
Waitin upon your turn, so when will you learn?
Ain't no turns given, be twistin and takin' it
Puttin' they sack down, then puttin' they mack down
Me myself I hustle with finesse yes I'm an Oakland baller
Rule number one: check game, and fo' sho' you gon' respect game
Be yo' own, meanin' buy yo' own dope
Cause that front is punk, somethin' I never funked with
Be true to this game and this game will be true to you
That's real; disrespect, see what this here do to you
That jackin and robbin, despisin your homie
Ain't healthy, endin up dead 'fore they get wealthy
But not me though, I'm sewin somethin' major
So what I reap is boss -- that's why my public status is floss
Went from a, young gangsta livin' residential
To a, young gangsta workin presidential
(Game's been good to me)

(Lady Levi)
Me boy Tu-pac ALWAYS look good
You know that's true 'I'm look good every time
Ooh, war? Step up
(Game's been good to me)
Can yi know I'm servin' up blood claat
Playin' yi games
Ooh, we take game, we WON
(I don't care what it did to them
The game's been good to me)
Any by now, all, yi haffa forget fi we WON
Everytime

Verse Three: 2Pac

I'm just a young black male, cursed since my birth
Had to turn to crack sales, if worse come to worse
Headed for them packed, jails, or maybe it's a hearse
My only way to stack mail, is out here doin' dirt
Made my decisions do or die, been hustlin since junior high
No time for askin why, gettin' high, gettin' mine
Put away my nine, cause these times call for four-five sales
Cause life is hell and everybody dies
What about these people I despise -- them loud talkin' cowards
Shootin guns into crowds, jeapordizin lives
Shoot 'em right between them thugz eyes, it's time to realize
Follow the rules or follow them fools that die
Everybody's tryin' to make the news, people confused
Quit tryin' to be an O.G. and pay your dues
If you choose to apply yourself, go with the grain
And come the riches and the girls and the fame
Heavy in the game
(Game's been good to me)

(Lady Levi)
Boy, ya nah bitch!
Major that's true we look good every time
When we at Beers Diamond
And Tupac drives vintage car
(Game's been good to me)
And fi dem frame dem look good, oh no?
This whole world ya call on
Gonna mass on a face
(I don't care what it did to them
The game's been good to me)
For any, section of bumba ras claat, oh!
Flush it! ... Oh!
Nobody wan come test me y'know
True dem we a drive pretty car
Wanna no part of any ting
And now you wan come drown a gun
But ya see we know, you haffa show 'I'm MAXIMUM respect
For when a blood claat run or when a pussy walk up
We look good every time
Nuff dollars, DOLLARS
Y'know about dollars dem right?
But we nah talk no shit
We haffa walk de walk for we a talk, see it?
Cause action, action speak louder dan words
You know da record!
Don't blood claat ting at ALL
(2Pac)
Damn, another funeral, another motherfucker
Lord knows * 'Pac is choking on blunt smoke *
Lord knows * coughing harder *
Lord knows * one final cough *

I smoke a blunt to take the pain out
And if I wasn't high, I'd probably try to blow my brains out
I'm hopeless, they shoulda killed me as a baby
And now they got me trapped in the storm, I'm goin' crazy
Forgive me; they wanna see me in my casket
And if I don't blast I'll be the victim of them bastards
I'm loosin hope, they got me stressin, can the Lord forgive me
Got the spirit of a thug in me
Another sip of that drink, this Hennesey got me queasy
Don't wanna earl, young nigga take it easy
Picture your dreams on a triple beam, and it seems
Don't underestimate the power of a fiend
To my homies on the block
Slangin rocks with your glocks put this tape in your box
When you're runnin' from the cops -- and never look back
If they could be black, then they would switch
Open fire on them busta-ass bitches, and Lord knows...

(Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
Lord knows * coughing again *
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
The Lord knows * still coughing *
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
The Lord knows
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)

I wonder if the Lord will forgive me or bury me a G
I couldn't let my adversaries worry me
And every single day it's a test, wear a bulletproof vest
And still a nigga stressin over death
If I could choose when a nigga die, figure I'd
Take a puff on the blunt, and let my trigga fly
When everyday it's another death, with every breath,
It's a constant threat, so watch yo' step!
You could be next if you want to, who do you run to?
Murderin niggaz, look what it's come to
My memories bring me misery, and life is hard
In the ghetto, it's insanity, I can't breath
Got me thinkin', what do Hell got?
'Cause I done suffered so much, I'm feelin' shell-shocked
And driveby's an everyday thang
I done lost too many homies to this motherfuckin game
And Lord knows...

(Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
Lord knows
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
Lord knows!
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
The Lord knows
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)

One-time! One-time!
Fuck the five-oh 'cause they after me
Kill me if they could, I'll never let 'em capture me
Done lost too many niggaz to this gangbangin
Homies died in my arms, with his brains hangin', fucked up!
I had to tell him it was all right, and that's a lie
And he knew it when he shook and died, my God
Even though I know I'm wrong man
Hennesey make a nigga think he strong, man (heh heh)
I can't sleep, so I stay up, don't wanna fuck them bitches
Try to calm me down, I ain't givin' up
I'm gettin' lost in the weed, man, gettin' high
Livin' everday, like I'm gon' die (gon' die, gon' die)
I smoke a blunt to take the pain out, and if I wasn't high
Probably try to blow my brains out
Lord knows...

(Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
Lord knows!
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
Lord knows... Jesus...
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
(He is listening! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)

(Lord knows... Lord knows... he he... he... he... heeee...)
(Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
(Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
(Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
(Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
You are appreciated

When I was young me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, scared to go home
I was a fool with the big boys, breakin all the rules
Shed tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies
The same drama, when things went wrong we blamed mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary
Hey, I'd see the penitentiary
One day, runnin from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, mama
You always was a black queen, mama
I finally understand for a woman it ain't easy tryin to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare
Tell me how you did it? 
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand

You are appreciated

Lady, don't ya know we love ya (dear mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (you are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't ya know we love ya

Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love for my daddy 'cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry
'Cause my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless
But all along I was lookin for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin
I needed money of my own so I started slangin
I ain't guilty 'cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin money in your mailbox
I love payin rent when the rent's due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to ya
'Cause when I was low you was there for me
You never left me alone because you cared for me
And I can see you comin home after work, late
You're in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate
You're just workin with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgivin
But now the road got rough, you're alone
Tryin to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand

You are appreciated

Lady, don't ya know we love ya (and dear mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (you are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't ya know we love ya

Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
'Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy, there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are fulla all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be all right if you hold on
It's a struggle, everyday gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand

You are appreciated

Lady, don't ya know we love ya (dear mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (you are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't ya know we love ya (dear mama)

Sweet lady
Lady (dear mama)
Lady
Lady
Keepin' it real

Verse One: 2Pac

I take a shot of Henessey now I'm strong enough to face the madness
Nickel bag full of sess weed laced with hash
Phone calls from my niggaz on the, other side
Two childhood friends just died, I couldn't cry
A damn shame, when will we ever change
And what remains from a twelve gauge to the brain
Arguements with my Boo is true
I spend mo' time with my niggaz than I do with you
But everywhere it's the same thang, that's the game
I'll be damned if a thang changed, fuck the fame
I'll be hustling to make a mill-ion, lord knows
Ain't no love for us ghetto children, so we cold
Rag top slowin down, time to stop for gas
Beep my horn for a hoochie with a proper ass, uh
It ain't easy, that's my motto
Drinkin' Tanqueray straight out the bottle
Everybody wanna know if I'm insane
My baby mama gotta mind full of silly games
And all the drama got me stressin like I'm hopeless, I can't cope
Me and the homies smokin' roaches, 'cause we broke
Late night hangin' out till the sunrise gettin' high
Watchin the cops roll by
It ain't easy... that's right

Chorus: 2Pac

It ain't easy, being me
Will I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free

Verse Two: 2Pac

I can't sleep niggaz plottin on to kill me while I'm dreamin'
Wake up sweaty and screamin, 'cause I can hear them suckers schemin
Probably paranoid, problem is, them punks be fantasizin
A brother bite the bullet, open fire and I died
I wonder why this the way it is, even now
Lookin' out for these killer kids, 'cause they wild
Bill Clinton can you recognize a nigga representin
Doin' twenty to life in San Quentin
Gettin' calls from my nigga Mike Tyson, ain't nuttin nice
Yo 'Pac, do something righteous witcha life
And even thou you innocent you still a nigga, so they figure
Rather have you behind bars than triggers
But I'm hold ya down and holla Thug Life, lickin' shots
Till I see my niggaz free on the block
But no it ain't easy, hahahah
Till I see my niggaz free, on the block, oh
It ain't easy


Verse Three: 2Pac

Lately been reminiscin
Bout Peppermint Schnapps in Junior High hit the block
Keep an eye on the cops while D-Boys slang rocks
It's the project kid without a conscience, I'm havin' dreams
Of hearin screams at my concerts, me all my childhood peers
Through the years tryin' to stack a little green
I was only seventeen, when I started servin' fiends
And I wish there was another way to stack a dollar
So my apoli', cause these hard times make me wanna holler
Will I live to see tomorrow, am I fallin' off?
I hit the weed and then proceed to say fuck all of y'all
Ain't nobody down with me I'm thuggin', I can't go home
Cause muh-fuckers think I'm buggin, so now I'm in
This high powered cell at the county jail
Punk judge got a grudge, can't post no bail, what
Do I do in these county blues
Gettin' battered and bruised by the you know who
And these fakes get to shakin when they face me
Snakes ain't got enough nuts to replace me
Sittin' in this, livin' hell, listenin to niggaz yell
Tryin' to torture 'em to tell, I'm gettin' mail
But ain't nobody sayin' much, the same old nuts
Is makin' bucks while these sluts is gettin' fucked
They violated my probation, and it seems
I'll be goin' on a long vacation, meanwhile
It ain't easy
No it ain't easy
(2Pac) Whassup? It's 2Pac. Can you get away?
Let me come swoop you up.
(Girl) You know I got a man.
(2Pac) I know you got a man
But he ain't gon' if I take you out.
(Girl) Of course he gon' mind.
(2Pac) Let me take you to lunch.
I'll have you back before he even get home;
Before anybody see.
(Girl) I can't. (Aww c'mon!) He ain't gon' let me.
(2Pac) Pleeeeeease...
(Girl) Nah.
(2Pac) Oh aight. What's wrong with your eye?
Why you got on glasses?

Verse One: 2Pac

Ever since I met ya I could beat depression
It's like your man don't understand, all he does is stress ya
I can see your state of misery from the introduction
Ain't 'bout no suckin and touchin, just harmless discussion
Maybe we can see a better way, find a brighter day
Late night phone conversations -- would that be OK?
I don't wanna take up all your time, be the next in line
Tell me your size, let me find you things with you in mind
I can see you're cautious and I'm careful not to scare you
But anticipation of love makin'
Got you shakin when I'm standin near you
News of precision will prepare ya
In case you get scared, just ask the man in the mirror
Now the picture's getten clearer all he does is hit you hard
I tell you to leave, and you tell me keep my faith in God
I don't understand, I just wanna bring ya home
I wonder should I leave you alone and find a woman of my own
All the homies tell me that you don't deserve it
I contemplate -- but in my heart I know you worth it
Tell me can you get away?

Ebony, can you get away?
C'mon... let's go... can you get away?
Can you get away?

(Girl) So much pressure in the air
(2Pac) I know, I know
(Girl) And I can't get away
(2Pac) Just for a little while love
(Girl) I'm not happy here
(2Pac) I know it's hard but, can you get away?
(Girl) So much pressure in the air
(2Pac) Let's go man, get up outta there
... Can you get away?
(Girl) And I can't get away
(2Pac) Do you love him?
(Girl) I'm not happy here
(2Pac) Do you love that man?

Verse Two: 2Pac

Could it be my destiny to be lonely?
And checkin' for these hoochies that be on me 'cause they phony
But you was different -- I got no need to be suspicious
'Cause I can tell -- my life with you would be delicious
The way you lick your lips and shake your hips got me addicted
I'm sittin' here hoping that we can find some way to kick it
Even though I got your digits gotta struggle to resist it
Slowly advance and miss my chance not to miss it
You blow me kisses
When he ain't lookin', now your heart's tooken
My only wish is that you change your mind and he get shook
Wanna take you there but you scared to follow, come see tomorrow
Hoping I can take you through the pain and sorrow
Let you know I care -- that someone's there for your struggle
Depend on me, when you have needs or there's trouble
I wanna give you happiness and maybe even more
I told you before, no time to waste we can hook up at the store
Can you get away?

(Girl) So much pressure in the air
(2Pac) I know it is
(Girl) And I can't get away
(2Pac) Yeah you can
(Girl) I'm not happy here
(2Pac) You ain't happy huh ...can you get away?
(Girl) So much pressure in the air
(2Pac) I know... is he beatin' on you?
(Girl) And I can't get away
(2Pac) Did he punch you?
(Girl) I'm not happy here
(2Pac) Throwin' you around the house?

Verse Three: 2Pac

I see you remiscin and I hope you listenin
In the position to pressure and offer competition
Me and you -- was meant to be my destiny, no longer lonely
Cause now it's on for you and me, all I can see
A happy home, that's my fantasy
But my reality is problems with your man and me
What can I do? Don't wanna lose you to the sucker
'Cause if he touch ya, I got some drama for that busta
Don't wanna rush ya -- but make your mind up fast
Nobody knows -- on who controls will it last, before I ask
I hope you see that I'm sincere, and even if you
Stay with him today I'm still here
I refuse to give up -- 'cause I believe in what we share
You're livin' in prison and what he's givin' can't compare
Cause everything I feel for you I wanna let you know
Passion it be yours and I'll never let you go
Tell me can you get away?

(Girl) So much pressure in the air
(2Pac) Can't get away... why?
(Girl) And I can't get away
(Girl) I'm not happy here
(2Pac) Let me take you away
All I really know, can you get away?
(Girl) So much pressure in the air
(2Pac) Man...
(Girl) And I can't get away
(2Pac) Course you can get away
(Girl) I'm not happy here
(2Pac) If you really wanted to get away
You could get away

Outro: 2Pac

You ain't got to go through all this drama and this stress
With this old half a man, yaknowhatI'msayin?
I ain't tryin' to put you in a position
Where you gotta give up your lifestyle for everything
You need but now... he ain't even takin' care of you
He beatin' on you and shit; look how you look
She motherfuckin wanna be with that nigga, yaknowhatI'msayin?
Shake that sucker to the left
Let me show you what this life is really about
YaknowhatI'msayin? You need to be on first class
Need to be goin' to Hawaii, seein the world
Seein what this world got to offer you
Not goin' to, yaknowhatI'msayin?
The emergency room, gettin' stitches
Cause this nigga done got jealous
Don't cry, it's all good

(Girl) Can you take me from here?
(2Pac) Shake that man, get away
(Girl) Can you take me from here?
I'ahhhhhm unhappy here
And I need you to show me love
Because it's so much pressure now
And I neeeeed to get awayyyheyyyeah
Here we go; we gonna send this one out to the old school
All these motherfuckers in the Bronx, and Brooklyn, and Staten Island
Queens, and all the motherfuckers that laid it down, the foundation
Ya know what I'msayin? Nuttin but love for the old school
That's who we gon' do this one for, ya feel me?

What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way

Nothin' like the old school/ain't nuttin like the old school

What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way

I remember Mr. Magic, FLASH, Grandmaster Caz
LL raisin' hell but, that didn't last
Eric B. & Rakim was, the shit to me
I flip to see a Doug E. Fresh show, with Ricky D
And Red Alert was puttin' in work, with Chuck Chill
Had my homies on the hill gettin' ill, when shit was real
Went out to steal, remember Raw, with Daddy Kane
When De La Soul was puttin' potholes in the game
I can't explain how it was, Whodini
Had me puffin on that buddha gettin' buzzed, cause there I was
Them block parties in the projects, and on my block
You diggi don't stop, sippin on that Private Stock
Through my speaker Queen Latifah, and MC Lyte
Listen to Treach, KRS to get me through the night
With T La Rock and Mantronix, to Stetsasonic
Remember Push It was the bomb shit, nuttin like the old school

What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way

Heheheh, it ain't nuttin like the old school

What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way

Ain't nuttin like the old school

What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way

Yeaheheh, it ain't nuttin like the old school

What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way

Nuttin like the old school

What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way

Ain't nuttin like the old school

What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way

Heheh... I had, Shell Toes, and BVD's
A killer crease inside my Lee's when I hit the streets
I'm playin' skelly, ring to leavey, or catch a kiss
Before the homies in my hood learned to smack a bitch, I remember
Way back, the weak weed they had
Too many seeds in the trey bag
I'm on the train headin uptown, freestylin'
With some wild kids from Bucktown, profilin'
'Cause the hoochies was starin', thinkin', Why them niggas swearin'?
I'm wonderin if that's her hair, I remember
Stickball, pump the hoochies on the wall
Or takin' leaks on the steps, stinkin up the hall
Through my childhood, wild as a juvenile
A young nigga tryin' to stay away from Riker's Isle
Me and my homies breakin nights, tryin' to keep it true
Out on the roof sippin 90 proof, ain't nuttin like the old school

What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way

Heheheyah, that's right, it ain't nuttin like the old school

What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way

Ain't nuttin like the old school

What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way

Nuttin like the old school

What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way

Nuttin like the old school

What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way

Ain't nuttin like the old school

What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way

Hahah... remember poppin' and lockin to Kurtis Blow, the name belts
And Scott LaRock the Super Hoe back in Latin Quarters
When Slick Rick was spittin' La Di Da Di
Gamin the hoochies at the neighborhood block parties, I remem-ber
Breakdancin to Melle Mel
Jekyll and Hyde, LL when he Rocks the Bells
Forget the TV, about to hit the streets and do graffiti
Be careful don't let the transit cops see me
It ain't nuttin like the old school

(Grand Puba sample repeats every bar to end)

It ain't nuttin like the old school
Hahahah, it ain't nuttin like the old school
Hey, heheaha, on the real though, ain't nuttin like the old school

Remember seein Brooklyn go crazy up in the motherfuckin party?
Member how fuckers used to go, Is Brooklyn in the house?
And motherfuckers would lose they GOD DAMN MIND
That's the old school to me; that's what I'm sayin' (Su-per, Sperm)
I remember goin' places that motherfuckers was scared to say
They was from anywhere but Brooklyn; that shit was the bomb
Back in the motherfuckin old school nigga
Remember skelly nigga? Knockin' niggaz out the box, poppin' boxes?
Member stickball? Member niggaz to run that shit like that?
Member the block members screamin up at your mom from the window?
(LL Cool J is hard as HELL...)
The ice cream truck, member all the mother...
Member the Italian icey's yo?
Yo remember the Italian icey's the Spanish niggaz comin' down
With the coconut icey's and shit?

I came through the door, said it before
That was the SHIT
(2Pac)
Haha, what you say?
Who you callin rapist? Ain't that a bitch
You devils, are so two faceted
Wanna see me locked in chains, dropped in shame
And gettin' stalked by these crooked cops a-gain
Fuckin' with the young black male, tryin' to stack bail
And umm, stay away from the packed jails
I told the judge I'm in danger
And that's why I had that fo'-five with one in the chamber
Fuck the world!

Chorus: 2Pac

(They tryin' to say that I don't care)
I woke up screamin, Fuck the world!
(They tryin' to say that I don't care)
Just woke up and screamed, Fuck the world!
(They tryin' to say that I don't care)
Uh, I woke up and screamed, Fuck the world!
(They're tryin' to say that I don't care)
Just got up and screamed, Fuck the world!

(2Pac)
When I was comin' up rough that wasn't even what you called it
That's why I smoke blunts now and run with alcoholics
I'm gettin', threats to me, comin' from my enemies
And, in they dreams it's, Hell where they sendin me
Have I, lost control or just another soul
A car full of motherfuckers when we roll
Sippin on yak as I sit back (YES!) life as a big mack
Brothers come up and say, You did that? (uh, uh, uh)
Never take yo' eyes off the prize, and even if you gettin' high
Don't ever hesitate to try
Cause you can fall off or stay ballin, niggaz we all in
And them my motherfuckers callin (oh, oh, oh)
Fuck the world!

Chorus: 2Pac

(They tryin' to say that I don't care)
I woke up and screamed, Fuck the world!
(They tryin' to say that I don't care)
Just woke up and screamed, Fuck the world!
(They tryin' to say that I don't care)
I got up and screamed, Fuck the world!
(They tryin' to say that I don't care)
I woke up and screamed, Fuck the world!
(They tryin' to say that I don't care)

(2Pac)
Man, fuck the world...
Damn, they wanna label me a menace
'Cause I'm sittin' here sippin on Guinness
Weighin 165, and these tricks should die
For bein jealous of a brother when he rides
I can see it in yo' eyes, you wanna see a young playa fallin'
They hate to see a nigga ballin
Some of you suckers is rottin, plottin on what I got
And then you wonder why I shot him (boo-ya!)
Stop givin' game for free, you wanna hang with me
Like being a thug is the thang to be?
But I got love for my homies, the G's and macks
And if you're black, you better stay strapped
Nigga, fuck the world!

Chorus: 2Pac

(They tryin' to say that I don't care)
I woke up and screamed, Fuck the world!
(They try to say that I don't care)
I woke up and screamed, Fuck the world!
(They tryin' to say that I don't care)
Got up and screamed, Fuck the world!

Haha, fuck the world! Fuck it
I hear my niggaz screamin fuck the world!

(2Pac)
They wanna know if I claim the click, that I'm hangin' with
And if I'm down with this bangin' shit
Well homie I don't give a fuck if you Blood or 'Cause
Long as ya got love for thugs
But don't try to test me out, stall that
Homie this is Thug Life nigga and we all strapped
I been through, Hell and back, and if I, fell black
Then it's, back to the corner where we sell crack
Some of you niggaz is bustas; you runnin' 'round
With these tramp=ass bitches, don't trust her
But don't cry, this world ain't prepared for us
A straight thug motherfucker who ain't scared to bust
Fuck the world!

Chorus: 2Pac

(They tryin' to say that I don't care)
I woke up and screamed, Fuck the world!
(They're tryin' to say that I don't care)
I woke up screamin, Fuck the world! (Uh!)
(They tryin' to say that I don't care)
I woke up screamin, Fuck the world!
(Yeah what's goin' on y'all?)
(Uh, uh, uh..) Fuck the world!

(I don't care... I don't care, I don't care!)
Child: Why you by the window?, what's wrong daddy?
Mother: I know what's wrong with that crazy motherfucker
He's just stand by the goddamn window
With that fuckin' AK all day
You don't work, you don't fuck, you don't,
You don't do a goddamn thing

I see death around the corner, gotta stay high while I survive
In the city where the skinny niggas die
If they bury me, bury me as a G nigga, no need to worry
I expect retaliation in a hurry
I see death around the corner, any day
Trying to keep it together, no one lives forever anyway
Strugglin' and strivin', my destiny's to die
Keep my finger on the trigger, no mercy in my eyes
In a ball of confusion, I think about my daddy
Madder than a motherfucker, they never shoulda had me
I guess I seen too many murders, the doctors can't help me
Got me stressin' with my pistol in my sheets, it ain't healthy
Am I paranoid? Tell me the truth
I'm out the window with my AK, ready to shoot
Ran out of endo and my mind can't take the stress,
I'm out of breath
Make me wanna kill my damn self,
But I see death around the corner


(When we were kids, belonging felt good)
I see death around the corner
(But having respect, that feels even better)
I see death around the corner
(When we were kids, belonging felt good)
I see death around the corner
(But having respect, that feels even better)

I see death around the corner,
The pressure's getting to me
I no longer trust my homies,
Them phonies tried to do me
Smoking too much weed,
Got me paranoid, stressed
Pack a gat and my vest,
Under my clothes when I dress
Here's hopin' I die the way I lived,
Straight thuggin'
Huggin' my trigger for all them niggas
That was buggin'
My homie told me once,
Don't you trust them other suckers
They fought like they your homies
But they phony motherfuckers
And even if I did die young, who cares
All I ever got was mean mugs and cold stares
I got homies in my head
Who done passed away screamin', please
Young nigga, make Gs
I can't give up, although I'm hopeless,
I think my mind's gone
All I can do is get my grind on, death around the corner


I was raised in the city, shitty
Ever since I was an itty bitty kitty
Drinkin' liquor out my momma's titty
And smokin' weed was an everyday thang in my household,
And drinking liquor till you out cold
And tho' I'm gone now, nigga it's still on- Pow
Bustin' on them niggas till they gone
How many more jealous ass bitches, comin' for my riches
Now I gotta stay suspicious when I bone
'Cause if I ain't sharp and heartless,
Them bitches will start shit
Excuse me, but this is where we part bitch
No more game for free, please explain to me
Why niggas trip bitch, who you came to see?
Murderin' now but see me later man, as for my pops
I got homies that will hunt you till you drop
I hope the Lord will forgive me, I was a G
And gettin' high was a way of gettin' free
I see death around the corner


This is for all the real mothafuckin' niggas out there
I know you ain't scared to die
We all gotta go, ya know?
A real motherfucker will pick the time he goes
And make sure he handles his motherfuckin' business
Y'all niggas stop acting like pussies out there,
All right

(Movie bites)

I'm tired off getting ripped off by guys like that

I want his family dead, I want his house burned to the ground
I want to got there in the middle of the night,
I wanna piss on his head
I want his family dead, I want his house burned to the ground
I want to got there in the middle of the night,
I wanna piss on his head

I want that son of a bitch dead, I want him dead
I want him dead, I don't care
(Tupac)
That's right nigga you gotta get your papers in this motherfucker
I ain't mad at ya at all (damn)
Aiyyo, what the fuck you wanna be when you grow up RahRah?

(RahRah) Nigga, is you stupid, I wanna be a motherfuckin Outlaw
(Tupac) That's right nigga, hahaha... housin these hoes, you feel me?
(RahRah) Aight, knowhatI'msayin?
(Tupac) You got to do that shit, keepin' it real nigga or what?
(RahRah) Keepin' it real!
(Tupac) How old are you nigga?
(RahRah) I'm eleven

(Tupac)
Cause all I see is, murder murder, my mind state
Preoccupied with homicide, tryin' to survive through this crime rate
Dead bodies at block parties, those unlucky bastards
Gunfire now they require many closed caskets
Who can you blame? It's insane what we dare do
Witnessin evil that these men do, bitches sin too
In fact they be the reasons niggaz get to bleedin
For the fuckin' fire when I leave em, you shoulda seen em
Hostile hoes catch elbows (beotch!) and foes disposed of
And snitches get dealt with, with no love
Body bags of adversaries that I had to bury
I broke the law and they jaw, all in the same flurry
But never worry, they'll remember me through history
Causin motherfuckers to bleed, they'll label me a

Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (They came in to sin)
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (Dear God, I wonder could you save me?)

(Tupac)
Before I close my eyes I fantasize I'm livin' well
When I awake and realize I'm just a prisoner in hell
Just as well, cause in my cell I'm keepin' pictures of these bastards
Excersisin, visualizin, everyone inside a casket
Picture me blasted, surrounded by niggaz in masks
Sent with the task to harass and murder my ass
Will I last? Heaven or Hell? Freedom or jail?
Shit's hard, who can you tell? and if we fail?
High speeds, and thai weed on the freeway
When will they learn to take it easy? Uh
Drivebys and niggaz die, murder without a motive
By making motherfuckers fry
Got me runnin' from these coward-ass crooked-ass cops
Helicopters tryin' to hover over niggaz till we drop
Got no time for the courts, my only thought is open fire
Hit the district attorney, but fuck that bitch, 'cause she's a liar
Now it's time to expire, I see the judge, spray the bitch
"Motherfuckers is crooked," is what I scream, and hit the fence
I commence to get wicked, spittin' rounds as the plot thickens
Never missin' an early grave is my only mission
If I die, never worry, bury me beside my four-five
May God forgive me, I was high, label me a


(Dramacydal)
Society lied to me, I ain't never gonna try to be
My mob'll be doin' robberies, and stickups on these wannabe's
I witnessed niggaz lose they chest
For ordinary reasons niggaz bodies put to rest
So I just... swallow my Beck's and holla, "Fuck em!"
And if I'm next... just let a nigga step with somethin'
I ain't fearin nuttin

Young and thuggin', prepared for bustin' if that's my destiny
Ready for whatever, see you niggaz can't get the best of me
(Hold me down) Definitely no need for askin
(Now we mashin) Top speed (smokin' weed) blastin (biotch!)

'Cause when I bust 'em they gonna shiver, the killer squad soldiers
Got bodies floatin' in the river, what is they sayin'?
Talkin' bout prayin' -- they need to stop, that ain't gon' help
These niggaz sprayin up my block, tryin' to take my wealth


(Tupac)
Fuck the judge, I gotta grudge
Punk police, niggaz run the streets
Hahah, it ain't nuttin but muuuuzik
Shit's changed
1995 the game has changed, motherfuckers is actin' REAL strange
The rules is all rearranged
You got babies lyin' dead in the streets
These punk police is crooked as me
But all I see is motherfuckers actin' less than G's
Stop bein a playa-hater, be a innovator nigga
Fuck that shit, don't be no entertainer and a stranger
Be a real motherfucker keep it real pack that steel
Cause you know these streets is real deal
Muh'fuckers wanna see me in my casket
Jealous, motherfuckin bastards
I never die, thug niggaz multiply
Cause after me is Thug Life baby
Then the young thugs
Then the youngest thug of all my nigga RahRah
(2Pac *singing in background* 2X)
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nuttin to a G

(Let's get ready to ruuumbllle!)

(2Pac *speaking over background*)
Now you know how we do it like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
That get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches

(2Pac *singing in background starts to overlap/repeat*)
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
Police bustin' at me
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
Got the police bustin' at me
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah...

(2Pac *speaking over background*)
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind nigga
My ambitions as a ridah!
My ambitions as a ridah!

(2Pac)
So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin' without heart
Was born rough and rugged, addressin the mad public
My attitude was, Fuck it, cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
Uh, and my ambitions as a ridah to catch her
While she hot, and horny, go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear, Go to the tele hoe
You put what money in a Benz, cause bitch I'm barely broke
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed feelin' crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin and prayers, to breakin motherfuckers to pay-up
I got no time for these bitches, cause these hoes tried to play us
I'm on a meal-ticket mission, want a mil', so I'm wishin
Competition got me ripped, on that bullshit they stressin (boo-yaa!)
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's manditory
No guts no glory my nigga bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the bidness so I got with Death Row
Now these money hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin and plannin on schemes, to come and trick us
But Thug niggaz be on point and game tight (yeah)
Me, Syke and Bogart, wrap it up the same night
Got problems then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggaz is jealous cause deep in they heart they wanna be me
Uh, yeah, and now ya got me right beside ya
Hopin you listen I catch you payin' attention
To my amibitions as a ridah

Chorus: 2Pac

(Singing) I won't deny it, I'ma straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
(Singing) My ambitions as a ridah
(Singing) Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nuttin to a G

(Tupac)
(I won't deny it, I'ma straight ridah)
Peep it... it was my only wish to rise
Above these jealous coward mutherfuckers I despise
When it's time to ride, I was the first off this side, give me the nine
I'm ready to die right here tonight, and motherfuck they life (yeah nigga!)
That's what they screamin as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
So open fire, I see you kill me (that's all you niggaz got?) witness my steel
Spittin' at adversaries envious and after me
I'd rather die before they catchin me, watch me bleed
Mama come rescue me I'm suicidal thinkin' thoughts
I'm innocent, so there'll be bullets flyin when I'm caught
(Shoot!) Fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrifice
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson
Thuggin' for life and if you right then nigga die for it
Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it
When it's time to die to be a man you pick the way you leave
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah


(Tupac)
My murderous lyrics equipped with spirits of the Thugs before me
Pay off the block evade the cops 'cause I know they comin' for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
Now I'm back my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds, sure as some bitches bleeds
Niggaz'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Blast me but they didn't finish, (buck buck buck buck buck)
Didn't diminish my powers
So now I'm back to be a motherfuckin menace, they cowards
That's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggaz on my team, so indeed, they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I caught the perfect way that God made it
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money, I'll have these motherfuckers buried (I been)
Gettin' much mail in jail, niggaz tellin' me to kill it
Knowin' when I get out, they gon' feel it
Witness the realest, a whoridah when I put the shit inside
The cry from all your people when they find her
Just remind ya, my history'll prove I been it
Revenge on them niggaz that played me,
And all the cowards that was down widdit
Now it's yo' nigga right beside ya
Hopin you listenin, catch you payin' attention
To my ambitions as a ridah
(2Pac) Ah yeah
(Down) Yeauh
(2Pac) It's all about you, one time
(Down) I'ma say it's all about you baby, yeah
(2Pac) Haha, for the bitches that think it's all about you
It's all about you
(Down) This Dru Down in the house, with my boy 'Pizznac
YouknowhatI'msayin?
(2Pac) It's all about you
(Down) Yeah I'm gon' say it's all about you
But you know I'm lyin' though, hah! Yeauh

(2Pac)
You probably crooked as the last trick; want it light
But how I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch
Thinkin' I had her but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck I'm stuck with fuckin' with the wrong one, uh
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin'
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin' with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin' for some love
In every club, I see you starin' like you want it
Well baby if you got it better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
I try to holla but you tell me you taken
Sayin' you ain't impressed, with the money I'm makin'
Guess it's true what they tellin' me
Fresh out of jail, life's Hell for a black, celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you widdit
Fantansies of us sweatin, can I hit it? (Hahaha)
Addicted to the things you do, but still true
What I'm sayin' Boo, is this is all about you

(Nate Dogg)
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
(Yeah nigga, ha ha ha ha!)
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe

(2Pac)
I make a promise if you go with me, just let me know
I'll have you hollerin my name out before I leave
Nobody loves me I'm a thug nigga; I only hung out
With the criminals and the drug dealers, I love niggaz
'Cause we comin' from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick, the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa, and I don't even care
Creep though, weed smoke's into the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Waitin for niggaz at the end, of every show
I just seen you in my friend's, video
Could never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin' through
It's all about you... hahaha, yeah nigga
It's all about you

(Nate Dogg)
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe

(Outlawz)
Is you sick from the dick, or is it the flu?
It ain't about you or your bitch ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty hoe
You think it's all about you? Well Boo
I gets Down like Dru and my nasty new niggaz, too

You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Golddiggin, cold diggin a gold Rolex

I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cuts, I came to fuck, try skeezin me
Runnin' up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch from the West Coast to West Virginia

(Nate Dogg)
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe

(Snoop Doggy Dogg *speaking over last two lines*)
I'm tellin' ya, it's the same ol' shit
I mean... god damn, youknowhatI'msayin?
I'm sittin' back, watchin Montell Jordan video
I see the same bitch, who was in, my homeboy Nate Dogg video
Then I flip the channel
I'm checkin' out my homeboy Tupac video
I see the same bitch that was in my video, yaknahmsayin?
And then yaknahmsayin what make that even mo' fucked up
I'm watchin a Million Man March
And I see the same bitch, on the Million Man March
That was in, the homeboy Warren G video
I mean, damn, everywhere I look, everywhere I go
I see the same hoe
Don't get mad, I'm only bein real
Yeah
(2Pac) Hey Nate you know you got to focus on this motherfucker
We's gonna talk about these scandalous hoes
(Nate) I can talk about scandalous bitches
(2Pac) Oh I know you can!
I know you that's why we gonna do it
Daz on the beat
Hey Daz, nigga stop fuckin' around with the piano nigga
Just drop that shit like uh, this here

(2Pac)
I met you through my homie now you act like you don't know me
So disappointed cause baby that shit was so phony
It's not for me, you see no lovin' from my closest homies
Woulda paid you no mind, but baby you was all up on me
While you proceed with precision, you had the table hosed
No, I ain't mad at you baby, go 'head and play them fools
They chose not to listen, so now he stuck inside his house
And can't leave without his bitch permission
The mission's to be a playa, my alias is Boss
Drop a top on these jealous niggaz, playa let me floss
Y'all don't wanna see me in pain
I'll leave that ass like Toni Braxton, Never breathing again
It's scandalous, I never liked your back stabbin ass, triiick
Used to watch you money grabbin, who you baggin beeyitch?
Ready to bust, in the city you don't know who to trust
But bitches lookin' scandalous

Chorus: Nate Dogg

Scandalous... she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous... she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
Scandalous... she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous... she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous

(2Pac)
How's it hangin'? Cause baby from the back the shit is bangin'
I've been stressin in this ghetto game, tryin' to do my thang
Won't be no bullshit, no ass-kissin'
This bitch'll have ya wakin' up with all your cash missin'
I'm askin, as if I'm qualified to analyze
You're lookin' at a bitch who specialize in tellin' lies
She got a body make a motherfucker fantasize
Her face ain't never shed a tear through them scandalous eyes
My sister ? in poverty
Plus I knew she was a freak bitch so why should it bother me?
I'd probably be sprung, addicted to the heat of her tongue
And though I don't where we're goin', she's makin' me come
I've been trained as a boss playa, so what you sayin'?
Let me show you, got some hookers we can toss later
Before I let her get me off guard
Went in the purse took a hundred dollars
Nigga I'm so scandalous


(2Pac)
Dangerous and ambitious, while schemin on gettin' riches
I'm spittin' at tricks 'cause I'm addicted to pretty bitches
Currency motivated, not easily terminated
Now that we made it, my niggaz can never be faded
This is my prophecy -- I gotta be paid
All you cowards that try to stop me is beggin for early graves
I thought we was cool, I was a fool, thinkin' you could be true
When I don't fuck with your punk crew
These are the tales for my niggaz doin' time in the cell
I went from hell, to livin' well
Bustin' at niggaz who said my name in vain
I got no time for them tricks, I'm heavy in the game
I wanna be a baller, please
But the bitches and the liquor keep on callin me
I'm floatin free on the highway, formulatin plans
Can't wait till I see L.A., 'cause it's so scandalous


Chorus *repeat to end* (2Pac speaks over it)

(2Pac)
Aiyyo... how the prettiest bitch be the more scandalous the hoe be
You ever peep that shit? (Nah)
A bitch can be like fifteen, fuckin' with a nigga 35
Gettin' him for ends
Hoes these days is way too motherfuckin intelligent
When these niggaz get to trickin, hahaha, it's over then
That's aight though
Keep a nigga heavy in the game, bout so long
Watch them hoes
All you niggaz out there
Beware these lyin' ass scandalous bitches
Verse One: Daz

You find an MC like me who's strong
Leavin' motherfucker's aborted, with no verbal support
And when I command the microphone I gets deadly as Kahn though
With a bear and a snake and a panda, I'm on those
Who can withstand, the mo' power I gain
And make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck ya brain
Imagine and keep on wishin upon a star
Finally realizing who the fuck we are
When I penetrate, it's been withstandin, faded
Would it be the greatest MC of all time
When I created rhyme for the simple fact
When I attack I crush your pride
My intention to ride, every time all night
I'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
For me to put down my guard, I'm faced witha mirage
Breakin in gas with the six-eight all day
In and out with my pay
I'm soon to count the bodies...

Verse Two: Tupac

So mandatory my elevation my lyrics like orientation
So you can be more familiar with tha nigga you facin
We must be based on nothin' better than communication
Known to damage and highly flammable like gas stations
Sorry I left that ass waitin
No more procrastination give up to fate, and get that ass shakin
I'm bustin' and makin' motherfuckers panic
Don't take ya life for granted put that ass in the dirt
You swear the bitches planned it
My lyrics motivate the planet
It's similar to Rhythm Nation
But thugged out, forgive me Janet
Who's in control I'm acvtivatin your soul
You know, the way the games gettin' sold
Yo, two years ago, a friend of mine
Told me Alize and Cristal blows your mind
Bear witness to the dopest fuckin' rhyme I wrote
Takin' off my coat, clearing my throat

Chorus: Method Man

I got my mind made up, come on... (come on)
Get in get in too (get on it)
Let it ride (get wit it) tonight's tha night
I got my mind made up, come on...
Get in get in too
Let it ride... tonight's tha night

Verse Three: Kurupt

Well I comes through with two packs
Of the bomb prophalaks for protection
So my fuckin' sac won't collapse
Cause nowaday's, shit's evading the x-rays
Sending young motherfuckers to an early grave
I wonder, if my terrifying tactics of torturing MC's
Shows my heart's as cold as the tundra
Electryfing like thunder, I'm just too much
Rough and raw with that motherfuckin poisonous touch
I'm an MC with lyrics that's tha fuckin' bom-bay
Ya got dissed, that's before it's ingest like balmay
My rhymes, I leave a mark on ya mind
As the deadly vibes spread through ya head like Sam Time
There's no escape, nah I ain't blastin
I use my mental to assassinate assassin's for those askin
Opposed to laughin', raw maniacal villain
Laughter enhances the chances of tha killin'
Why is that? 'Cause smilin' faces deceive
You best believe, to MC's I'm the deadliest disease
My thoughts rip ya throat and make it hard to breathe
Ya whole camp's under siege, and I'm Jason Vorhees
In the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mikes
My verbal snipe, your vocab on site
I'm out tha cut, uncut and raw with no clause for all
So all my rhymes hit and split tha bricks on the wall
Ya already have an idea about tha superior sphere
The greater rhyme creator on both sides of tha equator
I rock from here to there, to Philly and back
To LA on the spot where I rock and bust like straps
As your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
Beware, set and prepare to enter verbal combat

Verse Four: Method Man

Fuck you losers, while you fake jacks I makes maneuvers
Like Hitler, stickin up Jews wit German lugers
The Mr. Meth-Tical from Staten Isle
Will be back after this mess-age don't touch tha dial
Rarely do you see an MC out for justice
Got my gun powder and my musket -- blaooow!
Melons get swellings, I paint mental pictures like Magellen
Half of my Clan's three deep felons
Niggaz best protect they joints for Nine-Nickel
Man I stay on point like icicles
Now who wanna test Tical then touch Tical
All up in your motherfuckin mouth
Head banger boogie
Catch me on tour with Al Doogie
Method Man roll too tight, you can pull me
Better take one and pass or that's that ass
Your vital statistics are low and fallin' fast
Johnny Blaze out to get loot like Johnny Cash
Play a game of Russian Roulette and have a blast

Verse Five: Redman

Aiyyo, lyrical gas spittin' tha criminal tactics
Non-believers get my dick and genitals backwards
Let's face it, there's no replacement
Taste this, mad underground basement, shit I'm laced with
Avalanche on ya whole camp when I'm splifted
Funk Doctor who? Spock bitch don't get it twisted
I got connects like Federal Express
To get the fresh package of bless, tha dogs can't fetch
Got the clear spot from tha rear block
To bust till every nigga here drop, men I fear not
Hold ya nose and blow out till ya ears pop
Since ya crew suit you to shift now you claim that you get's lot
With, this underground cannabis
I'm dangerous like John the bomb analyst
Then proceeds like keys
My degrees freeze consecutively like EPMD LP's
Lick off a shot and hit ya fam by mistake
So I erase the whole front row at the wake
I planned my escape in case jake or a snake bust it
I'm the one pushin the hearse in the first place
Confidence for you shaky ass folks
Pump for Rockafella for the day he got smoked
Choke, off this anecdote got you ope
Get roast, by my lyrics Billy Dee .45 Coly
And I'm out for nine nickel (INS tha rebel)
(West, list this, this, this...)
How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it, yeah? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

Love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a nigga wantin' it so bad I'm 'bout to pass out
Wanna dig you and I can't even lie about it
Baby just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it

Catch you at a club, oh shit you got me fiendin'
Body talkin' shit to me but I can't comprehend the meaning
Now if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin' eighty on the freeway, police catch me if you can

Forgive me I'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame I'm a simple man
Mr. International, playa with the passport
Just like Aladdin bitch, get you anything you ask for

It's either him or me, champagne, Hennessy
A favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a hoe need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need

Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin' baby, I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy nigga now tell me how U want it

How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
I'm livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

Tell me is it cool to fuck?
Did you think I come to talk, am I a fool or what?
Positions on the floor it's like erotic, ironic
'Cause I'm some what psychotic
I'm hittin' switches on bitches like I been fixed with hydraulics

Up and down like a roller coaster, I'm up inside ya
I ain't quittin' till the show is over, 'cause I'mma rider
In and out just like a robbery, I'll probably be a freak
And let you get on top of me, get her rockin' these

Nights full of Aliz&#xE9;, a livin' legend
You ain't heard about these niggaz play these Cali days
Delores Tucker, you'se a motherfucker
Instead of tryin' to help a nigga you destroy a brother

Worse than the others, Bill Clinton, Mr. Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game is told
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Want some on lease? I'm makin' millions, niggaz top that

They wanna censor me, they'd rather see me in a cell
Livin' in hell, only a few of us'll live to tell
Now everybody talkin' 'bout us I could give a fuck
I'd be the first one to bomb and cuss, nigga tell me how U want it

How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
I'm livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

Raised as a youth, tell the truth I got the scoop
On how to get a bulletproof because I jumped from the roof
Before I was a teenager, mobile phone, Sky Pager
Game rules, I'm livin' major, my adversaries

Is lookin' worried, they paranoid of gettin' buried
One of us gon' see the cemetery
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin' high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die

I wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million
And then I'm chillin' fade 'em all
These taxes got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me
Media is in my business and they actin' like they know me

Ha ha ha, but I'mma mash out, peel out
I'm with it quick I'se quick to whip that fuckin' steel out
Yeah nigga it's some new shit so better get up on it
When ya see me tell a nigga how ya want it, how do U want it?

How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
I'm livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

How do you want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

Youse a cold ass nigga on them hogs

(Snoop)
Sho nuff, I keep my hand on my gun
'Cause they got me on the run
Now I'm back in the courtroom waitin on the outcome
Free Tupac, is all that's on a niggaz mind
But at the same time it seem they tryin' to take mine
So I'ma get smart, and get defensive and shit
And put together a million march, for some gangsta shit

(2Pac)
So now they got us laced
Two multimillionare motherfuckers catchin cases (mmm)
Bitches get ready for the throwdown
The shit's about to go down
Uh, me and Snoop about to clown
I'm Losin My Religion, I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin'
Niggaz be actin' like they savage, they out to get the cabbage
I got, nothin' but love, for my niggaz livin' lavish

(Snoop)
I got a pit named P, she niggarino
I got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
And I, think I got a black Beamer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Seagel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up, by the little homie in the Regal
Mmm, it feel good to you baby bubba
Ya see, this is for the G's and the keys motherfucker

(2Pac)
Now follow as we riiiiide
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the West side
And I can make you famous
Niggaz been dyin' for years, so how could they blame us

Now give me fifty feet
Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
And keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, suffering is grief
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck wit me
I bust and flea, these niggaz must be crazy what?
There ain't no mercy motherfuckers who can fade the Thugs
(Hahah right) You thought it was but it wasn't, now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player

(Snoop)
It's like 'cause, blood, gangbangin
Everybody in the party doin' dope slangin
You got to have papers in this world
You might get your first snatch, before your eyes swerl
Ya doing ya job, every day
And then you work so hard till ya hair turn gray
Let me tell you about life, and 'bout the way it is
You see we live by the gun, so we die by the gun's kids

(2Pac)
They tell me not to roll with my glock
So now I gotta throw away
Floatin in the black Benz, tryin' to do a show a day
They wonder how I live, with five shots
Niggaz is hard to kill, on my block
Schemes for currency and doe related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm tryin' to get up on it
My nigga Dogg with me, eternally the most wanted

Chorus (w/ variations to end)
Intro: 2Pac

Hey DeVante
Nigga, don'tcha know we're gonna sow up every bitch in the country
Me and you, up in the same motherfuckin room
On the same level
This shit here, hahahaha
Please, no more pain
That's right nigga
Hey drop that shit boy

Verse One: 2Pac

My adversaries cry like hoes fully eradicate my foes
My lyrics explode on contact, gamin you hoes
Who else but Mama's only son, fuck the phony niggaz I'm the one
Say my name, watch bitches come, now fire
When ready, stay watchin now figure, increase speed
Make you motherfuckers bleed from your mouth quicker
Plus all these niggaz that you run with, be on some dumb shit
Trick on the hoes, I ain't the one bitch
Holla my name and witness game official, it's so sick
Have every single bitch that came witchu, on my dick
Plus this alcohol increases the chance to be deceased
I'm movin you stupid bitches, vicious telekenesis
Am I reachin' your brain? Nigga how can I explain?
How vicious this Thug motherfucker came
When I die, I wanna be a livin' legend, say my name
Affiliated with this motherfuckin game, with no more pain

I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane (repeat 4X)

Verse Two: 2Pac

Line up my adversaries, blast on sight, and fuck your boyfriend
Bitch, I want some ass tonight, you know my steelo
Alize and Cristal, weed sure you heard of all the freaky shit they say about me, huh
Plus all you busters is jealous, pull your gun out and blast
I dare you niggaz to open fire, I'll murder that ass
And disappear before the cops come runnin', my glock's spittin' rounds
Niggaz fallin' down clutchin they stomach
It's Westside, Death Row, Thug niggaz on the rise
Busters shot me five times, real niggaz don't die
Can ya hear me? Laced with this game, I know you fear me
Spit the secret to war, so cowards fear me
My only fear of death is reincarnation
Heart of a solider with a brain to teach your whole nation
And feelin' no more pain


Verse Three: 2Pac

Bury me that's what they all say, it's time to make a killin'
Sure to make a million with DeVante
Bitch I know you want me, what your mouth say? Now, watch your eyes
You don't wanna get with me, that's a lie
I got my hands on your hips, no time to bullshit
Freaky bitch, come give me kiss
Tell them niggaz from other areas, brothers from here
So obsessed with this money makin' it ain't nothin' we fear
Now they label me a troublemaker, 'cause I'm a ridah
Death to you playa haters, don't let me find ya
Mama made me rugged, baptised the public
Now you hard thugs, nigga don't you love it
It's similar to multiple gunshots, retaliation is a must
Wasn't too sure what you facin so watch the guns bust
You niggaz'll bleed, fuckin' with me you'll be deceased
Never restin in peace nigga, with no more pain


(Tupac talking over the chorus)
Hahahahaha, yeah nigga, yeah! Hahahaha
No more pain
It's just like that nigga, like that yeah
No more pain
Motherfuckers can't handle that shit
Much too much for these bitches
No more pain
Feel me nigga? Feel me?
How you figure you can fuck with me?
Fully automatic type shit
No more pain
Coward ass niggaz, cowards
Come put your mouth on this pistol nigga
Come put your mouth on the pistol, no more pain
Close your eyes nigga, do it
Die in the dark, no more pain
Say thuuuuug life babe

Death Row, so what you motherfuckers do?
Hey that's DeVante droppin' that beat like that BEYATCH
In case you wonderin
And jealous niggaz, hahaha, see y'all niggaz
Motherfuckin niggaz are shit

(Chorus being whispered in the background)
Westsiiiiiide! Death to everybody that ain't down with me
That's on, feel me? Hahaha
Oh yeah, to the cowards, you know what I mean
Just feel that, Thug Life, shit don't stop
Motherfuckers got Downs Syndrome, motherfuckers
Weak ass niggaz, skanless cunts, fuckin' C.E... O.'s
Put your mouth on this pistol nigga
Put your mouth on the pistol!
Hahahaha, yeah nigga no more pain
Prison ain't changed me nigga, it made me worse
Feel me nigga, haha
No more pain
Hey DeVante I'm givin' these motherfuckers choices
Niggaz can roll with us, or they can be rolled under us
That's on you nigga, what you wanna do?
Last year we was lettin these niggaz kick up dust
This year you motherfuckers gonna be dust
Thug Life nigga Westsiiiiide!
Ah, Suge what I tell you nigga,
When I come out of jail what was I gonna do
I was gonna start diggin' into these niggas chest, right
Watch this, hey Quik let me see them binoculars, nigga
The binoculars

Ha ha ha ha, yeah nigga time to ride
Grab your bulletproof vest nigga
'Cause it's gonna be a long one
Now me and Quik gonna show you niggas what it's like on this side
The real side
Now, on this ride there's gonna be some real mutha-fuckas
And there's gonna be some pussys
Now the real niggas gonna be the ones with money and bitches
The pussys are gonna be the niggas on the floor bleedin'
Now everybody keep your eyes on the prize cause the ride get tricky
See you got some niggas on your side
That say they're your friends
But in real life they your enemies
And then you got some mutha-fuckas that say they your enemies
But in real life they eyes is on your money
See the enemies will say they true
But in real life those niggas will be the snitches
It's a dirty game y'all
Y'all got ta be careful about who you fuck with and who you don't fuck with
Cause the shit get wild y'all
Keep your mind on your riches, Baby
Keep your mind on your riches

9-1-1 it's a emergency cowards tried to murder me
From hood to the 'burbs, everyone of you niggas heard of me
Shit I'm legendary niggas scary and paralyzed
Nothing more I despise than a liar
Cowards die
My mama told me When I was to see
Just a vicious mutha fucker while these devils left me free
I proceed to make them shiver
When I deliver
Criminal lyrics
From a world wide mob figure
Thug niggas from everywhere Mr. Mackaveli
Niggas is waiting for some thug shit, that's what they tell me
So many rumors but I'm infinitely Immortal Outlaw
Switching up on you ordinary bitches
Like a south paw you get let
And every breath I breathe until the moment I'm deceased
Will be another moment ballin' as a 'G'
I rip the crowd, then I start again
Internally I live in sin
Until the moment that they let me breathe again
The heartz of men


The Heartz of Men

My lyrical verse with so much pain
That to some niggas it hurts
My guns bust
And if you ain't one of us
It gets worse
Bitch niggas get their eyes swoll
In fly mode
I'm a homicidal outlaw
And five-o, get your lights on, fight long
Tonight's gonna be a fuckin' fight
So we might roll
My own homies say I'm heartless
But I'm a 'G' to this till the day I'm gone that's regardless
Drive-by, niggas bow down
Thought I'd rot in jail, paid bail, well niggas out now
Throw up your hands if you thugged out
First nigga act up
First nigga gettin' drugged out
I can be a villain if ya let me
I'll Muthafuck ya
If ya do upset me
Tell the cops to come and get me
Rip the crowd like a phone number
Then start again, don't have no muthafuckin' friends nigga
Look inside the heartz of men


In The Heartz of Men
In The Heartz of Men

To all my niggas engaged in making money in the fifty states
Keep your mind on your chips and fuck a punk bitch
No longer living in fear
My pistol close in hand
Convinced this is my year
Like I'm the chosen man
Give me my money and label me as a Don
If niggas is having problems
Smoke'em, fire and bomb
I died and came back,
I hustle with these lyrics as if it's a game of crack
Thugin' is in my spirit
I'm lost and not knowing
Scar'd up
But still flowing
Energized and still going
Uh, can it be fate
That makes a sick muthafucka break
On these jealous ass coward 'cause they evil and fake
What will it take?
Give me that bass line
I'm feeling bombed
Deathrow baby, don't be alarmed
The homie Quik gave a nigga a beat and let me start again
Represent
'Cause I've been sent
The heartz of men
How many brothas fell victim to tha streetz?
Rest in peace young nigga, there's a Heaven for a 'G'
It'd be a lie, If I told ya that I never thought of death
My niggas, we tha last ones left
But life goes on...

How many brothas fell victim to tha streetz?
Rest in peace young nigga, there's a Heaven for a 'G'
It'd be a lie, If I told ya that I never thought of death
My niggas, we tha last ones left
But life goes on...

Verse One:

As I bail through tha empty halls
Breath stinkin' in my draws
Ring, ring, ring
Quiet y'all
Incoming call
Plus this my homie from high school
He's getting bye
It's time to bury another brotha nobody cry
Life as a baller
Alchol and booty calls
We usta do them as adolecents
Do you recall?
Raised as G's
Loc'ed out and blazed the weed
Get on tha roof
Let's get smoked out
And blaze with me
2 in tha morning
And we still high assed out
Screamin' 'thug till I die'
Before I passed out
But now that you're gone
I'm in the zone
Thinkin'
'I don't wanna die all alone'
But now ya gone
And all I got left are stinkin' memories
I love them niggas to death
I'm drinkin' Hennessy
While tryin' ta make it last
I drank a 5th for that ass
When you passed...
Cause life goes on


Verse Two:

Yeah nigga
I got tha word as hell
Blew trial and tha judge gave you
25 with an L
Time to prepare to do fed time
Won't see parole
Imagine life as a convict
That's getten' old
Plus with tha drama
We're lookin' out for your babies mama
Taken risks, while keepin' cheap tricks from beatin' on her...
Life in tha hood...
Is all good for nobody
Remember gamin' on dumb hotties at your party
Me and you
No true a two
While scheming on hits
And gettin' tricks
That maybe we can slide into
But now you buried
Rest nigga
'Cause I ain't worried
Eyes blurry
Sayin' goodbye at the cemetery
Tho' memories fade
I got your name tated on my arm
So we both ball till my dying days
Before I say goodbye
Kato and Mental rest in peace
Thug till I die


Verse Three:

Bury me smilin'
With G's in my pocket
Have a party at my funeral
Let every rapper rock it
Let tha hoes that I usta know
From way before
Kiss me from my head to my toe
Give me a paper and a pen
So I can write about my life of sin
A couple bottles of Gin
In case I don't get in
Tell all my people I'm a Ridah
Nobody cries when we die
We outlaws
Let me ride
Until I get free
I live my life in tha fast lane
Got police chasen' me
To my niggas from old blocks
From old crews
Niggas that guided me through
Back in tha old school
Pour out some liquor
Have a toast for tha homies
See we both gotta die
But ya chose to go before me
And brothas miss ya while you're gone
You left your nigga on his own
How long we mourn
Life goes on...

(Chorus repeats to end)
(Spoken over repeating chorus:)

Life goes on homie
Gone on, 'cause they passed away
Niggas doin' life
Niggas doin' 50 and 60 years and shit
I feel ya nigga, trust me
I feel ya
You know what I mean
Last year
We poured out liquor for ya
This year nigga, life goes on
We're gonna clock now
Get money
Evade bitches
Evade tricks
Give players plenty space
And basically just represent for you baby
Next time you see your niggas
Your gonna be on top nigga
Their gonna be like,
'Goddamn, them niggas came up'
That's right baby
Life goes on...
And we up out this bitch
Hey Kato, Mental
Y'all niggas make sure it's popin' when we get up there
Don't front.
(Intro: 2Pac)

Only God can judge me, is that right?
(Synth voice) Only God can judge me now
Only God baby, nobody else, nobody else
All you other motherfuckers get out my business

(Verse One: 2Pac)

Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back
I couldn't trust my own homies just a bunch a dirty rats
Will I, succeed, paranoid from the weed
And hocus pocus try to focus but I can't see
And in my mind I'm a blind man doin' time
Look to my future cause my past, is all behind me
Is it a crime, to fight, for what is mine?
Everybody's dyin' tell me what's the use of tryin'
I've been trapped since birth, cautious, 'cause I'm cursed
And fantasies of my family, in a hearse
And they say it's the white man I should fear
But, it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make 'em wish I died
Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin' for
Everybody's droppin' got me knockin' on heaven's door
And all my memories, of seein brothers bleed
And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees
Recollect your thoughts, don't get caught up in the mix
Cause the media is full of dirty tricks
Only God can judge me

(Chorus: 2Pac)

(Synth voice) Only God can judge me
That's right baby, yeah baby
(Synth voice) Only God
(Synth + Pac) Only God can judge me, only God can judge
(Synth cont.) me, only God
Only God can judge me
(Synth + Pac) Only God can judge me
And only God can
(Synth voice) Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
(Synth + Pac) Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
(Synth voice) Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
(Synth voice) Only God can judge me now

(Heart monitor: long beep)
Flatline!

(Verse Two: 2Pac)

I hear the doctor standing over me (heart monitor: beeping slowly)
Screamin I can make it
Got a body full of bullet holes layin here naked
Still I, can't breathe, somethings evil in my IV
Cause every time I breathe, I think they killin' me (beeping sound stops)
I'm having nightmares, homicidal fantansies
I wake up strangled in, dangled in my bed sheets
I call the nurse cause it hurts, to reminisce
How did it come to this? I wish they didn't miss
Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here
Cause even Thugs cry, but do the Lord care?
Try to remember, but it hurts
I'm walkin' through the cemetery talkin' to the, dirt
I'd rather die like a man, than live like a coward
There's a ghetto up in Heaven and it's ours, "Black Power"
Is what we scream as we dream in a paranoid state
And our fate, is a lifetime of hate
Dear Mama, can you save me? And fuck peace
Cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat
No more hesitation each and every black male's trapped
And they wonder why we suicidal runnin' round strapped
Mista, Po-lice, please try to see that there's
A million motherfuckers stressin just like me
Only God can judge me

(Chorus w/ variations)

(Interlude: 2Pac)

That which does not kill me can only make me stronger
(That's for real)
And I don't see why everybody feel as though
That they gotta tell me how to live my life
(You know?)
Let me live baby, let me live

(Verse Three: Rappin' 4-Tay, Tupac)

Pac I feel ya, keep servin' it on the rilla
For instance say a playa hatin' mark is out to kill ya
Would you be wrong, for buckin a nigga to the pavement?
He gon' get me first, if I don't get him fool start prayin'
Ain't no such thing as self-defense in the court of law
So judge us when we get to where we're goin' wearin a cross, that's real
Got him, lurked him, crept the fuck up on him
Sold a half a million tapes now everybody want em
After talkin' behind my back like a bitch would
Tellin' them niggaz, "You can fade him," punk I wish you would
It be them same motherfuckers in your face that'll rush up in your place
To get your safe, knowin' you on that paper chase
Grass, glass, big screen and leather couch
My new shit is so fetti already sold a key of ounce
Bitch, remember Tupac and 4-Tay
Them same two brothers dodgin bullets representin the Bay
Pac when you was locked down, that's when I be around
Start climbing up the charts, so sick, but they tried to clown
That's why they ride the bandwagon still be draggin sellin lies
Don't think I don't see you haters, I know y'all in disguise

Guess you figure you know me 'cause I'm a Thug
That love to hit the late night club, drink then buzz
Been livin' lavish like a player all day
Now I'm bout to floss 'em off, player shit with 4-Tay
Only God can judge me

(Chorus w/ variations)

(4Tay) Only God main
(2Pac) That right?
(4Tay) That's real
(2Pac) Hahahahahaha
(4Tay) Fuck everybody else, yaknowhatI'msayin?
(2Pac) Man, look here man
My only fear of death is comin' back to this bitch reincarnated
That's for the homey mental
We up out

(Chorus w/out 2Pac continues to fade)
A military mind nigga
A military mind mean money
A criminal grind nigga
A criminal grind mean hustle
You know

We tradin war stories
We outlaws on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise
Look in my eyes. (2x)

Now can your mind picture
A thug nigga drinkin hard liquor
This ghetto life has got me catchin up to god quicker
Who would figure that all I need was a
Hair trigga Semi-Automatic Mac-11 just to scare niggas
Pardon my thug poetry
But suckers is born everyday and fear of man grow on trees
Criminal ties for centuries
A legend in my own rhymes
So niggas wishful when they mention
Makaveli was my tutor and Donald Goines
My father figure
Mama sent me to go play with the drug dealers
Henceforth
We thug niggas and we came in packs
Every one of niggas strapped sippin on 'nac(Cognac)
In the back, my AR 15
Thuggin till I die
These streets got me cravin thorazine
My lyrics are blueprints to money makin
Fat as that ass that honeys' shakin

Repeat chorus 2X

I must stay thuggin and shit
They call it overthuggin and shit
But I was just a younger nigga gettin older and lovin this shit
But what was I doin in this place?
To the fakes without a pistol in the first
Facin termination in the worst
But I figured to play the war
To watch all these playa hatin niggas position
For I could see em all
Made it up out of there
Lucky to be here
to tell you, but it'll never be a repeat
People I'm tryin to tell you

Now picture the scenery
I'm thugged out smokin greenery
Considered a BG(baby gangsta) but I'm offering
This game something deeper
My eyes only see these
That's why I'm definately bugged out
Learned to know how
Well to do now
By 18, turned out
And why I do it?
The ridin and smokin, collidin with foes in the first place
that shouldn't have fucked with us in the first place
Got real OG's(original gangsta) droppin game to the youngsters
Y'all don't want no fun
'Cause y'all be the next in the long line of ??

Chorus repeats 2X

I starts em off with this gansta raw story tale
Stackin loot up in the coup that I protect with a Mack 12
Slap my clip in the chamber
Fool, your life's in danger
No one will remain when I come through dumpin insane
Call me ?? Major Payne
Ya slay and move and gain
I be the nigga pullin the trigga and
Dumpin the hollow points in your brain
Mo bigger balls that RuPaul
Thug Life ain't a ball
We bust that ass up against a wall
? As for men ?
We bucks em down on the way to the ground
Ain't nuttin but the hog in me
This stuff is real, dough(though)
Killin the Po's and keep mobbin, G
???
?? with a sawed off
'Cause they dirty as drawers, y'all
And had them bitch niggas hauled off

Chorus repeats 2X

Mama had me lived and raised on shit that ain't ok
Ain't nuttin on this earth will make a nigga like me stay
I'm reminissin and catchin flashbacks when niggas
Ran up in my house and I was too young to try to blast back
What happend then, no one would tell me since I was 3
Heard they got to my peoples
Now they livin somewhere free
But fuck that
You got whats mines and I want that
Never drop my guard
Been on the squad
Since ways back
And now I'm sittin
Holdin in anger because my parents missin
Thuggin and murderin
Got some war stories for ya

Now look at me
Straight Outlaw Immortal
Never gave a fuck 'cause I was nobody's daughter
Outlaw from my tits to my clips
Don't try to figure 'cause the murderous tendencies of my mind
Can be controled, nigga
So who's the bigger?
Who's the quickest killer?
Would ya try to trip with my finger on the 9 milla
When I got cha, ak nine fourths(?)
Prayin to god as your life goes back and forth

Chorus repeats through the rest of the song

(Spoken)
War stories, nigga
Heh, heh. Ya playas, too
Thug Life. Outlaw Immortals. Mother fuckin Tupac AKA Makaveli
Can you feel me?
Just say never
Say Death Row
My niggas love that shit
Dramacydal in this mother fucker
Heh, heh. Yeah nigga. Shout outs to my niggas Fatal and Felony
See ?, ya bald head nut
What?

California love

California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A.
In the city of good old Watts
In the city, city of Compton
We keep it rockin'
We keep it rockin'

Dr. Dre
Now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild west
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your jimmy in the city of sex

We in that sunshine state with a bomb-ass hemp beat
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean, mean, money-making machines serving fiends

I been in the game for ten years making rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearing Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shining, looking like I robbed Liberace

It's all good from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city making pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way
Dre putting it down for Californ-I-A

California (California) knows how to party (knows how to party)
California (West Coast) knows how to party (yes they do, that's right)
In the city of L.A. (city of L.A.)
In the city of good old Watts (good old Watts)
In the city, city of Compton (city of Compton, yeah)
We keep it rockin' (keep it rockin')
We keep it rockin'

My niggas say, come on
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, mama
Shake it, Cali (shake it, Cali)
Shake it, shake it, baby (that's right)
Shake it, shake it, baby, baby
Shake it, shake it, mama
Shake it, Cali

2Pac
Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreaming
Soon as I step on the scene I'm hearing hoochies screamin'
Fiending for money and alcohol
The life of a Westside player, where cowards die
And it's all war

Only in Cali where we riot, not rally to live and die
In L.A. we wearing Chucks, not Ballies (that's right)
Dressed in Locs and khaki suits and ride is what we do
Flossing but have caution; we collide with other crews

Famous 'cause we program worldwide
Let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumping and grinding like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know The Row won't bow down to no man

Say what you say
But give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A.
From Oakland to Sac-Town
The Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put they mack down
Give me love

California (California) knows how to party
Really knows how to
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A. (South Central)
In the city of good old Watts (that's right)
In the city, city of Compton
We keep it rockin'
We keep it rockin'

(Yeah, yeah, now make it shake, c'mon)
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, mama
Shake it, Cali (shake it, Cali)
Shake it, shake it, baby (shake it, Cali)
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, mama (West Coast)
Shake it Cali

Oaktown, Oakland definitely in the house
'Frisco, 'Frisco
Hey, you know L.A. up in this
Pasadena, where you at?
Yeah, Inglewood, Inglewood always up to no good
Even Hollywood trying to get a piece, baby
Sacramento, Sacramento, where you at? Yeah
Throw it up, y'all, throw it up, throw it up, I can't see you

(California love)
Change, shit
I guess change is good for any of us
Whatever it take for any of y'all niggaz to get up out the hood
Shit, I'm wit cha, I ain't mad at cha
Got nuttin but love for ya, do your thing boy

Yeah, all the homies that I ain't talk to in a while
I'ma send this one out for y'all, nahmean?
'Cause I ain't mad at cha
Heard y'all tearin up shit out there, kickin up dust
(Danny Boy) I ain't...
Givin' a motherfuck, heheheheheh
Yeah, niggaz
(Danny Boy) ...mad at cha
'Cause I ain't mad at cha

Verse One: 2Pac

Now we was once two niggaz of the same kind
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line
You was just a little smaller but you still roll
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll
Member when you had a jheri curl didn't quite learn
On the block, witcha glock, trippin' off sherm
Collect calls to the tip, sayin' how ya changed
Oh you a Muslim now, no more dope game
Heard you might be comin' home, just got bail
Wanna go to the mosque, don't wanna chase tail
It seems I lost my little homie he's a changed man
Hit the pen and now no sinnin is the game plan
When I talk about money all you see is the struggle
When I tell you I'm livin' large you tell me it's trouble
Congratulation on the weddin, I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life, and that's no bullshitin
I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember
I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her
And I can see us after school, we'd BOMB
On the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shit's changed, and we don't even kick it
Got a big money scheme, and you ain't even with it
Hmm, knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker that'd
Go toe to toe when it's time to roll, you got a brother's back
And I can't even trip, 'cause I'm just laughin' at cha
You tryin' hard to maintain, then go head
'Cause I ain't mad at cha
(Hmm, I ain't mad at cha)

Chorus: Danny Boy

I ain't, mad, at cha (2Pac: I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't, mad, at cha

Verse Two: 2Pac

We used to be like distant cousins, fightin, playin' dozens
Whole neighborhood buzzin, knowin', that we wasn't
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I'm gettin' blitzed and I reminsce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin 'n' grindin wasn't nothin' on our mind
In time we learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back, to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony lovin' the way the guns blow
And even though we separated, you said that you'd wait
Don't give nobody no coochie while I be locked up state
I kiss my Mama goodbye, and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I'll return but I gotta fight the fate's arrived
Don't shed a tear, cause Mama I ain't happy here
I'm through trial, no more smiles, for a couple years
They got me goin' mad, I'm knockin' busters on they backs
In my cell, thinkin', "Hell, I know one day I'll be back"
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl I'll be there, so prepare, to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin' at cha
Cause youse a down ass bitch, and I ain't mad at cha

Chorus: Danny Boy

I ain't, mad, at cha (2Pac: I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't, mad, at cha (2Pac: A true down ass bitch, and I ain't mad at cha)

Verse Three: 2Pac

Well guess who's movin up, this nigga's ballin now
Bitches be callin to get it, hookers keep fallin' down
He went from nuttin to lots, ten carots to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big, man on the block
He's Mister local celebrity, addicted to move a key
Most hated by enemy, escape in the Luxury
See, first you was our nigga but you made it, so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you why you faded, in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin' so high off that bomb hopin we make it, to the better days
Cause crime pays, and in time, you'll find a rhyme'll blaze
You'll feel the fire from the niggaz in my younger days
So many changed on me, so many tried to plot
That I keep a glock beside my head, when will it stop?
Till God return me to my essence
Cause even as a adolescents, I refuse to be a convalescent
So many questions, and they ask me if I'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?
They got so much to say, but I'm just laughin' at cha
You niggaz just don't know, but I ain't mad at cha

Chorus: Danny Boy
Iiiiiiiii,

What'z ya phone number
Now I could make miracles with pimp hoes.
It's instrumental.
Waitin for the nyphos.
That's the intro.
Shook when ya rush me.
Walked up and touched me.
Why? Do you want to fuck me?
Just 'cause I'm paid in the worst way? True.
Lookin' kind a good in your birthday suit.
I wonder if your wild and ya act shy.
Do you like to be on top or the back side?
Watch me while you lick your lips, shake your hips.
Goddamn, I love that shit.
Yo, let's stop fakin and be real now.
I got a room and a hard on. Still down?
Met ya standin at a bar full of black dudes.
Said ya wanna see my scars and my tatooes.
When we head for my hideout, act right.
Boss playa when I ride out, that's right.
What'z ya phone number?

If you really wanna fuck with me, I'm ready.
Baby, let me give you a call.
How long will it take to break you off?
(Repeat once more)

Oh shit, baby is a dime piece.
Wanted this fine seat.
Personally rushed (???)
If I see ya right.
Now she can get me hard
Didn't wanna talk to me, till she see my car.
Never had sex with a rich rap star
Till I got her in the back of my homeboy's car.
Tell me, why do we live this way?
Money over bitches.
Let me hear you say:
What'z your phone number?
Are you alone?
Got a pocket full of rubbers, let's bone.
Time for your girlfriend to take you home.
I had fun,
But baby, gotta leave me alone.
Picture in my rhyme.
Take time to rewind these (???) words I say.
If you open your mind,
Bet in a minute you'll find it's time.
Let the Outlaws play.
What'z ya phone number.

"All right now, here we go"

Tell me, how many real motherfuckers feel me? I smoke a blunt
And freak the funk until these jealous motherfuckers kill me
I'm out the gutter, pick a hero
I'm 165 and staying high till I die, my competion's zero
'Cause I could give a fuck about you, better duck
Or I'll be forced to hit yo ass up I give a fuck
I'm sick inside my mind, why you sweatin me?
It's gonna take an army full of crooked ass cops to come and get me
Niggaz know I ain't the one to sleep on, I'm under pressure
Gotta sleep with my piece, an extra clip beside my dresser
Word to God I've been ready to die since I was born
I don't want no shit but niggaz trip and yo it's on
Open fire on my adversaries, don't even worry
Better have on a vest aim for the chest and then you buried
It's a man's world, niggaz get played, another stray
Hope I live to see another day, hey
I'm getting sweated by these undercovers, who can I trust?
Got my mama stressin thinkin' it's a drug bust
Gotta get paid but all the drama that's attached
We living a Drug Life, Thug Life, each day could be my last
Will I blast when it's time to shoot? Don't even ask
That's the consequences when ya livin', fast
Six bricks of tricks, for my niggaz, I gotta come up
And recoup, you keep the dope just bring me six figures
Is it a bust? I hear the sirens, run for cover
Over the fence and open fire

"All right now, here we go"

These motherfuckers on my ass I'm in traffic, will it be tragic?
I'm comin' round the corner like I'm Magic
Doin' ninety on the freeway, and hittin switches
In a high speed chase with these punk bitches
Don't turn around I ain't givin' up, 'cause they don't worry me
Pussy ass bitches better bury me
Runnin' outta gas time to park it, I'm on foot
We in the hood, how the fuck they gon catch a crook? Haha
I got away 'cause I'm clever
Went to my neighbors for a favor now you know players stick together
I watch the scene from the rooftop, spittin' loogies
At the coppers that pursue me, beotch!
I be a hustler till it's over, motherfucker
Open fire on you bustas

"All right now, here we go"

Don't try to follow me, I'm headed outta state
I gotta pay my fuckin' bills, so I'm transportin weight
Change my plates, pick up my nigga, and now we rollin'
Droppin' keys like they stolen, hehe
Tell me who do you fear? I'm outta town until the coast is clear
Enough dope to last a year
They got me running from the police, nowhere to go
With the lights out, rollin' down a dirt road
But I ain't goin' alive, I'd rather die than be a convict
I'd rather fire on my target
I hit the corner doing ninety, ah shit!
Them bitches right behind me
They take a shot and hit my fuckin' tires
Now, jump out the car then I open fire, sucka!

Hahahaha, Thug Life!

Major! Hell motherfuckin yeah
This one goes out to my nigga Mike Coolin, hell yeah
Mama raised a hellrazor...

Born thuggin'
Heartless and mean, muggin at sixteen
On the scene watchin fiends buggin
Kickin up dust with the older G's
Soakin up the game that was told to me
I ain't never touched a gat that I couldn't shoot, I learned
Not to trust the bitch from the prostitutes, was taught lessons
A young nigga askin questions while other suckers was guessin
I was ganked for sexin
Elementary wasn't meant for me, can't regret it
I'm headed for the penitentiary, I'm cuttin' class
And I'm buckin blastin, straight mashin
Mobbin through the overpass laughin'
While these other motherfuckers try to figure out, no doubt
They jealous of a nigga's clout, tell me Lord
Can ya feel me? I keep my finger in the trigger
Cause some nigga tried to kill me
And mama raised a hellraizor, everyday gettin' paid
Police on my pager, straight stressin
A fugitive my occupation is under question
Wanted for investigation, and even though
I'm marked for death, I'ma spark till I lose my breath
Motherfuckers, every time I see the paper
I see my picture, when a nigga's gettin' richer
They come to get ya, it's like a motherfuckin trap
And they wonder why it's hard bein black
Dear Lord can ya feel me, gettin' major, unhh

Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin' major
Lord be my savior, unnh
Mama raised a hellrazor
Dear Lord can ya feel me
Stress gettin' major, unnh
Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin' major

Tell me Lord can ya feel me, show a sign
Damn near running outta time, everybody's dyin'
Mama raised a hellrazor, can't figure
Why you let the police beat down niggaz
I'm startin to think all the rich in the world is safe
While the po' babies restin in the early graves
God come save the youth
Ain't nothin' else to do but have faith in you
Dear Lord I live the life of a Thug, hope you understand
Forgive me for my mistakes, I gotta play my hand
And my hand's on the sixteen-shot, semi-automatic
Crooked cop killin' Glock, tell me Lord
Can ya feel me? Show a way
I'm prayin' but my enemies won't go away
And everywhere I turn I see niggaz burn
Every nigga that I know's on death row
My younger homie's seventeen and he paid a price
Little young motherfucker doin' triple life
Though I tell him in his letters, it's gettin' better
If my nigga knew the truth he'd hit the roof
Just heard ya baby's mama was smoked out, fuck the drama
Wanna break my Loc out, smokin' blunts
Gettin' drunk off that Tanqueray gin
Bout to break my nigga out the fuckin' pen
Mama raised a hellrazor, uh, yeah
C'mon, uh, mama raised a hellrazor
Uh, dear Lord can ya feel me, stress gettin' major
(Lord be my savior, unnh)

Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin' major
Lord be my savior, unhh
Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin' major
Lord be my savior, unhh
Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin' major

Dear Lord can ya hear me, it's just me
A young nigga tryin' to make it on these rough streets
I'm on my knees beggin please come and SAVE ME
THE WHOLE WORLD done made a nigga crazy!
I got my three-five-seven can't control it
Screamin die motherfucker and he's loaded
Everybody run for cover, I cause shit
Thug Life motherfucker, duck quick
Now am I wrong if I am don't worry me
Cause do or die gettin' high till they bury me
Dear Lord if ya hear me, tell me why
Little girl like LaTasha, had to die
She never got to see the bullet, just heard the shot
Her little body couldn't take it, it shook and dropped
And when I saw it on the news I see busta girl killin' 'Tasha
Now I'm screamin fuck the world, in the end
It's my friends, that flip-flop
Lip-locked on my dick when my shit drop
Thug Life motherfucker I lick shots
Every nigga on my block dropped two cops
Dear Lord can ya hear me, when I die
Let a nigga be strapped, fucked up, and high
With my hands on the trigger, Thug nigga
Stressin like a motherfuckin drug dealer
And even in the darkest nights, I'm a Thug for Life
I got the heart to fight now
Mama raised a hellraiser why cry
That's just life in the ghetto, do or die
Fuck 2Pac that nigga ain't shit
That nigga ain't from muhfuckin' New York
That nigga be out there with them Cali niggas
Yo nigga man fuck Pac that nigga West Coast
That fucker that always with them New York niggas
Seen them with that nigga man that nigga ain't from the West Coast

Fuck that nigga man fuck that nigga let that nigga go to jail right
And fuck that nigga fuck that nigga fuck you too nigga

2Pac (overlapping)
I'm in this muthafucka
I guess these muthafuckas tryin' to take me out the business right
I guess I ain't East Coast enough for my niggas back in New York
And I ain't West Coast for these niggas on the West huh?
Fuck e'rybody

Thug style out this muthafucka niggas throw ya hands in the air
If you got Jeep make ya speakers pop
I want muthafucking police trying to pull niggas over on this one
We taking this one to the whole 'nother level gutter style Thug style
You feel me, things that we can only do as a real G
We ain't dead yet, hit me!


I got my Hennessy find ya foes
In a room full of niggas tryin' to hide ya hoes
I'm getting high off buddha
'Cause the times be slow
I keep my mind on dough
You never find me broke
And who meee a nigga livin' life like a G
In that artillery keepin' niggas off of me
I can't sleep living in these wicked times
Peep, niggas after me 'cause they see I'm stacking G's and heat
You can holler if you want to pleeease
I ain't runnin' with no punk crew bleeeed
Enemies and my range is on
You're in the danger zone
My fuckin' game is strong, Hotline
You suckas better find ya mind I got mine
From hustling and busting them rhymes
To my niggas up in Quentin
Down on Riker's Isle stay rile
But a nigga gotta use his styles
These,


Niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile juvenile
Was a problem child
Try to put me in the courts
But my force was wild
Bitchmade ass niggas don't know my style
These,
Niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile juvenile
Was a problem child
Try to put me in the courts
But my force was wild
Bitchmade ass niggas don't know my style


I could be wrong but I never got along with cops
It's like they stuck
From making niggas duck from Glocks all the time
My mind's full of thoughts of ends
I'm still rolling my bucket but I bought me a Benz (tadow)
My fake friends say they love me but I know they lie
Cause in the dark see they hearts' full of homicide
My mama cried when they took me off to jail
Only me inside the cell
Straight locked up in this hell
I hear some sucka screaming like the demon's inside
Will 'em away in the morning
Only the strong survive
I cry but in my own way
Swallow my pride pick a reason to hide
From all the niggas that die (Rest in Peace)
Cemetery full of brothers I buried
It's going down even now I wonder
Will I still be around my hometown is the gutter
I was born a wild came up out this dust
With my heartless style
These,


Niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile juvenile
Was a problem child
Try to put me in the courts
But my force was wild
Bitchmade ass niggas don't know my style
These,
Niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile juvenile
Was a problem child
Try to put me in the courts
But my force was wild
Bitchmade ass niggas don't know my style


I remember Uptown huh got to get to listenin'
To Mr. Magic cuttin' up the hits
And even though I had habit makin' words rhyme
I was caught up in the madness
Juvenile thugs come on
I tell the whole story nothin' but truth
Halloween throwin' eggs from the project roofs
And Pete and Lee young G's
With a gift of gab and tryin' to hook up with the hookers
Who was quick to stab remember mama's cooking
No school straight hookin'
And tryin' to get with light skinned
'Cause she good looking
And jumpin' over turnstiles 'cause we ain't paying
Call the cuties cuss words but we only playing (biotch)
I'm prayin' I can get a buck no luck
I had to move around a lot
'Cause my moms was stuck
I had family but I was way too wild
Had to move to the West to regain my style
These,

Chorus till end with ad libs
Power... pow... power...

Guess who's back? Hahaha, here we go
It's ninety-fo', what's next?

Power... enter my world

I guess this year gonna be a motherfucker for real niggaz
I swear these playa haters done got a taste of power
It ain't all good in the hood
Least not on my side, from where I stand
And the law? Man, fuck the law!
Niggaz must outthink, outstep, and continuously outsmart
The motherfuckin law, in every way
Key word in ninety-four is 'down low'
Gots to be struggling
I see how the rich got theirs
Nigga I'm legit, shit
Where do we go from here?
(Who's afraid, of the punk police?
To my niggaz run the streets, fuck peace) -- repeat in background
Hey niggaz, where your heart at?
See motherfuckers killin' babies, killin' mommas
Killin' kids, puttin' this in they motherfuckin mark
Now what type of mixed up trick would kill the future of our race
Before he would he look his enemy dead in the eye, and open fire?
These crazy motherfuckers got toys with guns
Jails for guns, but still, no god damn jobs
And they wonder why we loc'n up
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go?
*Singers singing variations of 'Where do we go from here'*
All you niggaz out there
The clouds shook, the world listened
We stood together in April of ninety-two
With duty, and a sense of honor
There is no limit to what WE can achieve
That's all on us... us...
Not my niggaz, not the whites, not the enemies
Or none of them motherfuckers, US
What can WE do? Shit
I declare a death sentence to all child molestors
Fake-ass bitches, male and female
And all you punk-ass snitches
We can do without your asshole
Let no man break, what we set
Where do we go from here?

Rest in peace, to Cato, I miss you
All the other real G's that passed away in ninety-three
In ninety-four, and more
What do we do? For us?
Chorus: I wonder if heaven got a ghetto (4X)

I was raised, the little young nigga doin' bad shit
Talk much shit 'cause I never had shit
I could remember being whupped in class
And if I didn't pass mama whupped my ass
Was it my fault papa didn't plan it out
Broke out left me to be the man of the house
I couldn't take it, had to make a profit
Down the block, got a glock, and I clock grip
Makin' G's was my mission
Movin enough of this shit to get my mama out the kitchen and
Why must I sock a fella, just to live large like Rockefeller
First you didn't give a fuck, but you're learnin now
If you don't respect the town then we'll burn you down
God damn it's a motherfuckin riot
Black people only hate police so don't try it
If you're not from the town then don't pass through
Cause some O.G. fools might blast you
It ain't right but it's long overdue
We can't have peace till the niggaz get a piece too
I want G's so you label me a criminal
And if I die, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto


Verse Two: 2Pac

Here on Earth, tell me what's a black life worth
A bottle of juice is no excuse, the truth hurts
And even when you take the shit
Move counties get a lawyer you can shake the shit
Ask Rodney, LaTasha, and many more
It's been goin' on for years, there's plenty more
When they ask me, when will the violence cease?
When your troops stop shootin niggaz down in the street
Niggaz had enough time to make a difference
Bear witness, own our own business
Word to God 'cause it's hard tryin' to make ends meet
First we couldn't afford shit now everything's free
So we loot, please don't shoot when you see
I'm takin' from them, cause for years they would take it from me
Now the tables have turned around
You didn't listen, until the niggaz burned it down
And now Bush can't stop the hit
Predicted the shit, in 2Pacalypse
And for once I was down with niggaz, felt good
In the hood bein around the niggaz, yeah
And for the first time everybody let go
And the streets is death row, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto


Verse Three: 2Pac

I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under I wonder what it take to make this
One better place, let's erase the wait state
Take the evil out the people they'll be acting right
Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And only time we deal is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And though it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black President, huh
It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
I wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living should I blast myself
I'm tired of being poor and even worse I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a ne-gro
Pull a trigger kill a nigger he's a hero
Mo' nigga mo' nigga mo' niggaz
I'd rather be dead than a po' nigga
Let the Lord judge the criminals
If I die, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto

Chorus (to :27 from fade)

Just think, if niggaz decide to retaliate
(Soldier in the house)
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto (4X to fade)
The only way to change me is maybe blow my brains out 
Stuck in the middle of the game to get the pain out 
Pray to my God everyday but he don't listen 
The poverty bothers me but mama's working wonders in the kitchen 
Listen I can hear her crying in the bedroom 
Praying for money we never think would she be dead soon 
Am I wrong for wishing I was somewhere else 
At 13 can't feed myself 
Can I blame daddy 'cause he left me 
Wish he would've helped me 
Too much like him 'til my mama don't love me 
On my own at a early age gettin' paid 
And I'm strapped so I'll never be afraid 
Where did I go astray I'm hanging in the back streets 
Running with G's and dope fiends will they jack me? 
Can't turn back my eyes on the prize 
I got nothing to lose 
Everybody gotta die 
Say good-bye to the bad guy 
That one you fucked when you passed by 
Buck buck (gunshots) from a Glock 
Tempered glass fly 
Do or Die walk a mile in my shoes 
And you'd be crazy too 
With nothing to lose 

I got nothing to lose (That's why I got gang related) 
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Nothing to lose 

I thank the Lord for my many blessings 
Though I'm stressin' keep a vest for protection 
From the barrel of the Smith & Wesson 
And all my niggas in the pen' 
Here we go again 
Ain't nothing separating us from a mack 10 
Born in the ghetto as a hustla' older 
Straight soldier bucking at them bustas 
No matter how you try niggas never die 
We just retaliate with hate then we multiply 
See me striking down the block hittin' co'ners 
Mobbin' like a motherfucka' livin' like I want to 
Ain't no stoppin' at the red lights I'm sideways 
Thug Life muthafucka criiime pays 
Let the cops put they lights on 
Chase me nigga 
Zig-zaggin' through the freeway 
Race me nigga 
In a high speed chase with the law 
The realest muthafucka that you ever saw 
I'm livin' raw 'til they bury me don't worry me 
I'm high livin' like I ain't afraid to die 
And you could walk a mile in my shoes 
And you'd be crazy too 

I got nothing to lose (That's why I got gang related) 
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Nothing to lose 

Ain't no escape from a deadly fate 
And everyday there's a million black bodies put away 
I'm startin' to lose hope 
It seems everybody's on dope 
Mama told me to leave 'cause she was broke 
Sometimes I choke on the indo 
Peepin' out the window alone on my own 
I'm a criminal 
Got no love from the household I'm out cold 
In the streets give me motherfuckin' peace 
I got nothing to lose 
And something to prove 
What do I do live Thug Life nigga stay true 
I wonder when they kill me 
Is there a Heaven for a real G 
Lord forgive me if you feel me 
'Cause all my life I was dirt broke 
With no hope lil' skinny muthafucka wantin' dough 
I hated cutting suckers with my razor blade 
But everyday it's a struggle to get major paid 
Anyway it's so hard on a nigga in this city 
No pity and ain't no love for the scrubs that be buyin' time 
If you could walk a mile in my shoes you'd be crazy too 
With nothing to lose 

I got nothing to lose (That's why I got gang related) 
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Nothing to lose 

It was a what type nigga be a Thug Life nigga 
We be the craziest, motherfucka'!
You know! 
It was a what type nigga be a Thug Life nigga 
We be the craziest!
Get money nigga
Yeah - aw yeah
Dedicate this one to all the hustlers
That get up every motherfuckin mornin and put they work in
I see you - I see you boy

I'm up before sunrise first to hit the block
Lil' bad motherfucker with a pocket full of rocks
Learned to throw them thangs, get my skinny lil' ass kicked
Niggaz laughed, till the first motherfucker got blas-ted
I put the nigga in his casket
And now they covering the bastard in plastic
I smoke blunts on the regular fuck when it counts
Tryin' to make a million dollars out a quarter ounce
Gettin' ghost on the five-oh, fuck them hoes
Got a forty-five screamin out surviv-al
Hey nigga can I lay low, cook some ya-yo
And holla five-oj when I say so
Don't wanna go to the pen, I'm hittin fences
NARC's on a nigga back missin' me by inches
And they say how do you survive, weighin one-fifty-five
In the city where the little niggaz die
Tell mama don't cry, cause even if they kill me
They can never take the life of a real G

I'm gettin' money (4x)

Still on parole and I'm the first nigga servin'
Pour some liquor on the curb, for my homies that deserve it
If I wanna make a million, gotta stay dealin'
Kinda boomin round the way, think today I make a killin'
Dressin down like I'm dirty, but only on the block
Just a clever disguise, to keep me runnin' from the cops
Gettin' high I think I'll die if I don't get no ends
I'm in a bucket but I'm ridin' it like it's a Benz
I hit the strip I let my music buck
Drinkin' liquor and I'm lookin' for a bitch to fuck
Rather die makin' money, than live poor and legal
As I slang another ounce, I wish it was a kilo
I need money in a major way
Time to fuck my girl, she gettin' paid today, ha hah ha
I live Thug Life and let the money come to me
'Cause they can never take the game from a young G

I'm gettin' money (4X)

Damned if I don't, and damned if a nigga do
Now watch a young motherfucker pull the trigger too
RAISE UP, and don't let them see ya cry
Dry your eyes, young nigga time for do or die
I pack a pistol in my pocket, ready on my Glock
Ain't no time for a nigga to even cock shit
I done seen a motherfucker peep pain
At point blank range 'cause he slept on the game
Ain't a damn thing changed, they shakin the dice
Now roll 'em if you can't stand pain better hold em
Cause ain't no tellin' what ya might roll
You might fold catch AIDS from a slight cold
You better live ya life to the fullest
Be quick to kill a bull got a pistol motherfucker better pull it
And even if they kill me
They can never take the life of a young G

I'm gettin' money (5X)
(If she didn't want to fuck then she never would've called you)
Yeah I dedicate this to my nigga Mike Tyson.
It's all good.

(2Pac) My definition of a thug nigga
Nobody's, closing me out of my business

Verse One: 2Pac

I played the cards I was given, thank God I'm still livin'
Pack my nine till it's time to go to prison
As I'm bailin down the block that I come from, still gotta pack a gun
Case some young motherfuckers wanna play dumb
I guess I live life forever jugglin
But I'll be hustlin till the early mornin 'cause I'm strugglin
Like drinkin' liquor make the money come quicker
Gettin' pages from my bitch it's time to dick her
I ain't in love with her, I just wanna be the one to hit her
Drop off and let the next nigga get her
That's the way it goes, it's time to shake a hoe, make the dough
Break a hoe when it's time to make some mo'
I keep my finger on the trigger of my Glock
Ridin' down the block lickin' shots at the punk-ass *cops*
And spittin' game through my mobile phone
The type of shit to get them hoes to bone
My Definition of a Thug Nigga

Chorus: (various samples)

Tis the season, to be servin' What you doin'?
Mob-mobbin like a motherfucker
Tis the season, to be servin'

Verse Two: 2Pac

Well I roll with a crew of zoo niggaz
They're quick to pulle a nine when it's time do niggaz
Comin' through like I'm two niggaz, a true nigga fuck a Zig Zag
Roll me a blunt and pass that brew nigga
I'm drivin' drunk on the freeway, so take it ea-sy
Lookin' for a new face to skeeze me
Everybody's lookin' for a nut but I'm searchin for the big bucks
Give a fuck, rather die than be stuck
In a one-room shack, and, kickin back
Daydreamin with the nine in my lap (huh)
So how's that from the mind of a Thug Nigga
Bought a fo'-five 'cause I heard that the slug's bigger
Figure the first motherfucker to jump'll find hisself
Gettin' swept off his feet by the pump
I put that on my moms, word to the motherfuckin trigger
Before I go broke I'll be a drug dealer, a Thug Nigga


Verse Three: 2Pac

Short than a motherfucker snatched up by one-time
Make a phone call and be back to ball by lunchtime
So here we go, we in the inner city
I keep my hand on my gat and stay cool, my attitude is shitty
Niggaz don't like me 'cause I'm makin' ends
Roll in a Benz and I blaze a blunt, 'cause I'm all in
And any nigga trying to take what I got'll
Hafta deal with the sixteen-shot Glock (huh)
So here we go, I can't be faded
Happy in the motherfucker, finally made it
Got my money in my pocket, finger on the trigger
And I ain't takin' shit from no niggaz
I'm just tryin' to make some money right
Put some motherfuckin food in my tummy right
I'm feelin' good like I'm supposed to, ready to ball
Find a spot and we can serve 'em all
My Definition of a Thug Nigga

Outro: (various samples)

Tis the season, to be servin'
Mobbin like a motherfucker, every single day
(2Pac) My Definition of a Thug Nigga
Tis the season, to be servin'

Nobody's, closing me out of my business
(Continually scratched to near end)
Little somethin' for my godson Elijah and a little girl named Corrine

Verse One:

Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
I give a holler to my sisters on welfare
Tupac cares, if don't nobody else care
And uh, I know they like to beat ya down a lot
When you come around the block brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive but don't forget, girl keep your head up
And when he tells you you ain't nuttin don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you you should leave him
Cause sista you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas ya up, I just call 'em how I see em
You know it makes me unhappy (what's that)
When brothas make babies, and leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies, that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up
I know you're fed up ladies, but keep your head up


Ooh child things are gonna get easier
Ooh child things are gonna get brighter

Ooh child things are gonna get easier
Ooh child things are gonna get brighter

Verse Two:

Aiyyo, I remember Marvin Gaye, used to sing ta me
He had me feelin' like black was tha thing to be
And suddenly tha ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew, and had a smoke or two
And I realize momma really paid the price
She nearly gave her life, to raise me right
And all I had ta give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic, and make it to tha bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay tha rent
And in the end it seems I'm headin for tha pen
I try and find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems tha rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up, and still keep from gettin' wet up
You know it's funny when it rains and pours
They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor
They say there ain't no hope for the youth and the truth is
There ain't no hope for tha future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother, for turning my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive, 'cause it's a setup
And even though you're fed up
Huh, ya got to keep your head up


Verse Three:

And uh
To all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by ya lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids, even if nobody else want em
'Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and comeback for more
Cause ain't nuttin worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
Hell of a hand without a man, feelin' helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dying inside, but outside you're looking fearless
While tears, is rollin' down your cheeks
Ya steady hopin things don't fall down this week
'Cause if it did, you couldn't take it, and don't blame me
I was given this world I didn't make it
And now my son's getten older and older and cold
From havin' the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin' Benz
I'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin friends
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up, but
Please... you got to keep your head up
(Snoop) Up out of there

With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg my fuckin' homey
Youse a cold ass nigga on them hogs

(Snoop)
Sho nuff, I keep my hand on my gun
'Cause they got me on the run
Now I'm back in the courtroom waitin on the outcome
Free Tupac, is all that's on a niggaz mind
But at the same time it seem they tryin' to take mine
So I'ma get smart, and get defensive and shit
And put together a million march, for some gangsta shit

(2Pac)
So now they got us laced
Two multimillionare motherfuckers catchin cases (mmm)
Bitches get ready for the throwdown
The shit's about to go down
Uh, me and Snoop about to clown
I'm Losin My Religion, I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin'
Niggaz be actin' like they savage, they out to get the cabbage
I got, nothin' but love, for my niggaz livin' lavish

(Snoop)
I got a pit named P, she niggarino
I got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
And I, think I got a black Beamer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Seagel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up, by the little homie in the Regal
Mmm, it feel good to you baby bubba
Ya see, this is for the G's and the keys motherfucker

(2Pac)
Now follow as we riiiiide
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the West side
And I can make you famous
Niggaz been dyin' for years, so how could they blame us
I live in fear of a felony
I never stop bailin these, motherfuckin G's
If ya got it better flaunt it, another warrant

(2Pac)
Now give me fifty feet
Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
And keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, suffering is grief
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck wit me
I bust and flea, these niggaz must be crazy what?
There ain't no mercy motherfuckers who can fade the Thugs
(Hahah right) You thought it was but it wasn't, now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player

(Snoop)
It's like 'cause, blood, gangbangin
Everybody in the party doin' dope slangin
You got to have papers in this world
You might get your first snatch, before your eyes swerl
Ya doing ya job, every day
And then you work so hard till ya hair turn gray
Let me tell you about life, and 'bout the way it is
You see we live by the gun, so we die by the gun's kids

(2Pac)
They tell me not to roll with my glock
So now I gotta throw away
Floatin in the black Benz, tryin' to do a show a day
They wonder how I live, with five shots
Niggaz is hard to kill, on my block
Schemes for currency and doe related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm tryin' to get up on it
My nigga Dogg with me, eternally the most wanted

Chorus (w/ variations to end)
Yo Mo Bee main, drop that shit!

Hey! Hey-ayyaahhy

You know what time, boo-yaow
I know it's time for you
So grab one by the hand youknowhatI'msayin
And uh, throw up that finger
Ay yo yo yo throw y'all fingers up!
Thug style baby, Thug style y'know?

Verse One:

Tell me baby are you lonely? Don't wanna rush ya
I can help ya if ya only, let me touch ya
If I'm wrong love tell me, 'cause I get caught up
And the life I live is Hell see, I never thought I'd see
The day when I would calm down, you ain't heard
I've been known to clown and Get Around, that's my word
See you walkin' and you lookin' good, yes indeed
Got a body like a sex fiend, you're killin' me
Witcha attitude to match right, don't be phony
'Cause I hate when you act like, you don't know me
I've be stressin in the spotlight, I want the fame
But the industry's a lot like, a crack game
Ain't no time for commitment, I gotta go
Can't be wit you every minute miss, another show
And even though I'm known for my one night stand
Look here, I wanna be an honest man, but temptations go...

Hey! Hey-ayyaahhy

Throw up the finger!
And all my homies go...
Give them the finger!
Ya know what baby it's like

*Singing*
I know you've been searchin for someone
To make you happy, and get the job done
You say you need it, a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care

Verse Two:

Will I cheat or will I be committed, heaven knows
Gettin' weak and I wanna hit it, so here I go
In my ride and I'm all in, gettin' high
I can hear the people callin, I'm passin by
Everybody knows I'm ball-in, and to God
Gotta keep myself from fall-in, but it's hard
All the cuties know I'm under pressure, what do I do
Gettin' shaky when she pull the dress up, and say it's cool
Should I stroke or should I wait a while, you decide
If you tell me that you don't want it, that's a lie
Move close and let me whisper, some dirty words
In your ears as I kiss ya, on every curve
Slow down baby don't rush, I like it slow
Can't hold it any longer, so let it go
Open the gates, do you wanna fall up in heaven
Don't worry, I let myself in, all I heard was...

Hey! Hey-ayyaahhy

Give 'em the finger!
All my homies go...
Throw your fingers up!
That's just the Thug in me girl, you know
Peep out all my homies, y'know, it's like

*Singing*
I know you've been searchin for someone
To make you happy, and get the job done
You say you need it, a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care

Verse Three:

A lot of people think it's easy, to settle down
Got a woman that'll please me, in every town
I don't wanna but I gotta do it, the temptation
Got me ready to release the fluid, sensation
Sit down and conversate like you know me, take my hand
Cause even Thugs get lonely, understand
Even the hardest of my homies need attention
Catch you blowin' up the telephone, reminiscin
I wanna take you to the movies, and the park
Let's find a spot for you to do me, in the dark
Now that it's passion, hold me tight
Don't need lights, I can see you by the moonlight
I know your man ain't lovin' you right
You're lonely and depressed you need a Thug in your life
Enough talkin', you want me to leave, I'll get to walkin'
See you later, cause baby I'm a player, and all I heard was

Hey! Hey-ayyaahhy

Give 'em the finger
And all my homies go...
Yo this how we gonna do this in the nine-trey y'know?
Throw your fingers up
Y'know?
They gonna peep this, this how we run game on you

*Singing*
Everybody, hey, all right
Hey, heyyyeah, heyyyay, oh

(2Pac)
All my niggaz go
Uptown in the
Give 'em the finger!
Throw your hands up
Give 'em the finger!
2pac:
Rest in peace to my mothafucka Biggie Smalls
That's right boy, it's goin' on
Right here, Thug Life
God bless the dead

God bless the dead and buried nigga
Don't worry if you see God first tell Him shit got worse
I ain't mad, I know you're representin the crew
And I can picture you in Heaven with a blunt & a brew
Fuck the world, pain was a part of the game
If you a baller, money went as quick as it came
My role models gone or they locked in the pen
Straight hustlas, caught up in the whirlwind
The other day, I thought I seen my homeboy Biggie
Sayin' shit don't stop, nigga, no pity
We all hoods, and all we ever had was dreams
Money makin' mothafuckas plot scandalous schemes
In the gutter, you learn to have a criminal mind
I was addicted to tryin', never meant to do time
My epitaph will read "Was the last of Gs
Kicked the shit to make the white man bleed
God bless the dead"

Chorus - 2pac:
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
God bless the dead

2pac:
Man, ain't nobody promised me a thang
I been caught up in this game
Ever since I was a little motherfucka wantin to hang
I can see 'em in my head, pow
Memories of my nigga but he dead now
Lookin' back in my yearbook all the years took
Half my peers, they're stretched for years
And if I die will they all shed tears
Two to the dome, leave me alone, let me get my head clear
Paranoid got me lookin' in the mirror
Behind me, life without my nine, I'd rather do the time
See I'm old enough to know that ain't no justice
Fuck the police and all the courts same way they fucked us
And why the hell am I locked in jail
They let them white boys free, we be shocked as hell
In my mind I can see it comin'
And all the time it's a plot to keep a nigga runnin'
By keepin' gun and never run unless I'm comin' at ya
Cry later but for now let's enjoy the laughter
God bless the dead


2pac:
Rest in peace to all the motherfuckas that passed too early
All the young motherfuckas that was took in they prime
Real motherfuckin Gz, this one is for you
Yo Stretch, Biggie

Stretch:
Yo Big this is to you my nigga
Springfield Hollis crew, Thug Life, YGz
Sendin they respect, know I mean?
You my nigga for life, forever
You're always gonna be with a nigga
No matter what, don't forget that

I pray before I go to sleep
Dear God save my place before I start to eat, cause times is hard
So I'm covered to my knees, oh why?
Why you had to take my nigga with the rock I buy?
You had to take a good one, a ghetto hood son, uzi weighin a ton
Niggas terrified of comin' from the young gun
Hearin that they did it outta fear don't amaze me
But it's mind blowin', so I'm flowin goin' crazy
Slip for cock the gun but he didn't run like a punk
He shoulda had the gauge in the trunk
For spunk is what he had, kid, I'd ratha attack Big
Now ya bout to smell the aftermath of what the mack did
Wannabe suckers wanna test, I'm tellin' you, yes
The teflon's bout to rip through your fuckin' vest
Guess who? I'll make a mess of your crew quick
The spirit Biggie Smalls and the ??? clique, yeah
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
God bless the dead

(2Pac) It's just me against the world
(Girl) Ooh, ooh
(2Pac) Nuttin to lose...
It's just me against the world baby
(Girl) Oah, oahhhah
(2Pac) I got nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world
(Girl) Oh-hah
(2Pac) Stuck in the game
Me against the world baby

Verse One: 2Pac

Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in the city, the cops is hot for me
The projects is full of bullets, the bodies is droppin'
There ain't no stoppin' me
Constantly movin while makin' millions
Witnessin killings, leavin' dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Carries to children 'cause they're illin
Addicted to killin' and the appeal from the cap peelin
Without feelin', but will they last or be blasted?
Hard headed bastard
Maybe he'll listen in his casket -- the aftermath
More bodies being buried -- I'm losing my homies in a hurry
They're relocating to the cemetery
Got me worried, stressin, my vision's blurried
The question is will I live? No one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin' this anger
Don't wanna make excuses, cause this is how it is
What's the use unless we're shootin no one notices the youth
It's just me against the world baby

(Girl) Me against the world
(2Pac) It's just me against the world
(Girl) Ooh yeah, ooh-hoo
(2Pac) It's just me against the world
(Girl) Me against the world
(2Pac) 'Cause it's just me against the world baby
(Girl) Hey!
(2Pac) Me against the world
(Girl) Ooh yeah
(2Pac) I got nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world baby
(Girl) I got nothing to lose

Verse Two: Dramacydal

Could somebody help me? I'm out here all by myself
See ladies in stones, Baby Capone's, livin' wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin'
Seein Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons, already crazy
And screamin I guess them nightmares as a child
Had me scared, but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route? For a crooked Outlaw
Veteran, a villain, a young thug, who one day shall fall

Everday there's mo'death, and plus I'm dough-less
I'm seein mo' reasons for me to proceed with thievin
Scheme on the scheming and leave they peeps grieving
Cause ain't no bucks to stack up, my nuts is backed up
I'm bout to act up, go load the Mac up, now watch me klacka
Tried makin' fat cuts, but yo it ain't workin
And Evil's lurking, I can see him smirking
When I gets to pervin, so what?
Go put some work in, and make my mail, makin' sales
Risking 25 with a 'L', but oh well

(Girl) Me against the world
(2Pac) With nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world
(Girl) Ooh yeah... ooh-ooh
(2Pac) It's just me against the world baby
(Girl) Me against the world
(2Pac) I got nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world
(Girl) Oahhhoh
(2Pac) Ha ha
It's just me against the world baby
(Girl) Ha-ah, HA-Ah!
(2Pac) With nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world baby
(Girl) Me against the world, hoah
(2Pac) Me against the world
I got nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world baby
(Girl) Ha-hah (hehe) hey!

Verse Three: 2Pac

With all this extra stressin
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest? Through this supression
They punish the people that's askin questions
And those that possess, steal from the ones without possesions
The message I stress: to make it stop study your lessons
Don't settle for less - even the genius asks-es questions
Be grateful for blessings
Don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let the pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference
Politicians and hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nuttin like the game
It's just me against the world

(Girl) Me against the world
(2Pac) Nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world baby
(Girl) Me against the world
(2Pac) Got me stuck in the game
It's just me against the world
(Girl) Oahah
(2Pac) I'd be ashamed to lose
It's just me against the world baby
(Girl) Me against the world

Outro: 2Pac

Heh, hahahahahahah
That's right
I know it seem hard sometimes but uh
Remember one thing
Through every dark night, there's a bright day after that
So no matter how hard it get, stick your chest out
Keep your head up, and handle it

(Girl) Me against the world
Me against the world
Me against the world
How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it, yeah? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

Love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a nigga wantin' it so bad I'm 'bout to pass out
Wanna dig you and I can't even lie about it
Baby just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it

Catch you at a club, oh shit you got me fiendin'
Body talkin' shit to me but I can't comprehend the meaning
Now if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin' eighty on the freeway, police catch me if you can

Forgive me I'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame I'm a simple man
Mr. International, playa with the passport
Just like Aladdin bitch, get you anything you ask for

It's either him or me, champagne, Hennessy
A favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a hoe need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need

Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin' baby, I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy nigga now tell me how U want it

How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
I'm livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

Tell me is it cool to fuck?
Did you think I come to talk, am I a fool or what?
Positions on the floor it's like erotic, ironic
'Cause I'm some what psychotic
I'm hittin' switches on bitches like I been fixed with hydraulics

Up and down like a roller coaster, I'm up inside ya
I ain't quittin' till the show is over, 'cause I'mma rider
In and out just like a robbery, I'll probably be a freak
And let you get on top of me, get her rockin' these

Nights full of Aliz&#xE9;, a livin' legend
You ain't heard about these niggaz play these Cali days
Delores Tucker, you'se a motherfucker
Instead of tryin' to help a nigga you destroy a brother

Worse than the others, Bill Clinton, Mr. Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game is told
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Want some on lease? I'm makin' millions, niggaz top that

They wanna censor me, they'd rather see me in a cell
Livin' in hell, only a few of us'll live to tell
Now everybody talkin' 'bout us I could give a fuck
I'd be the first one to bomb and cuss, nigga tell me how U want it

How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
I'm livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

Raised as a youth, tell the truth I got the scoop
On how to get a bulletproof because I jumped from the roof
Before I was a teenager, mobile phone, Sky Pager
Game rules, I'm livin' major, my adversaries

Is lookin' worried, they paranoid of gettin' buried
One of us gon' see the cemetery
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin' high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die

I wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million
And then I'm chillin' fade 'em all
These taxes got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me
Media is in my business and they actin' like they know me

Ha ha ha, but I'mma mash out, peel out
I'm with it quick I'se quick to whip that fuckin' steel out
Yeah nigga it's some new shit so better get up on it
When ya see me tell a nigga how ya want it, how do U want it?

How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
I'm livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

How do you want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

(What y'all want?)
Unconditional Love (no doubt)
Talking 'bout the stuff that don't wear off
It don't fade
It'll last for all these crazy days
These crazy nights
Whether you wrong or you right
I'm guna still love you
Still feel you
Still there for you
No matter what (hehe)
You will always be in my heart
With unconditional love

Verse One:

Come listen to my truest thoughts, my truest feelings
All my peers doing years beyond drug dealing
How many caskets can we witness
Before we see it's hard to live this life without God, so we must ask forgiveness
Ask mama why God deserved to die
Witness the tears falling free from my eyes before she could reply
Though we were born without a silver spoon
My broken down TV, show cartoons in my living room (hey)
One day I hope to make it, a player in this game
Mama don't cry, long as we try, maybe things change
Perhaps it's just a fantasy
A life where we don't need no welfare shit with our whole family
Maybe it's me that caused it the fighting and the hurting
In my room crying 'cause I didn't want to be a burden
Watch mama open up her arms to hug me
And I ain't worried 'bout a damn thang, with unconditional love

In this game the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love

Verse Two:

Just got the message you've been calling all week
Been out here hustling on these streets, ain't had a chance to speak
But you know, with you and me it's on G
We could never be enemies, cause you been such a good friend to me
Where would I be without my dogs
No wonder why when times get hard cause it ain't easy being who we are
Driven by my ambitions, desire higher positions
So I proceed to make Gs, eternally in my mission
Is to be more than just a rap musician
The elevation of today's generation if could make 'em listen
Prison ain't what we need, no longer stuck in greed
Time to play and strategize, my family's gotta eat
When we make somethin' out of nothing no pleasure in the suffering
Neighborhood would be good if they could cut out all the busting
The liquor and the weed the cussing sending love out to my block
The struggle never stops (unconditional love)

In this game the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love

Verse Three:

I'll probably never understand ya ways
With everyday I swear I hear ya
Trying to change your ways while gettin' paid at the same time
Just had a baby with the same eyes
Something inside, please let me die these are strange times
How come I never made it
Maybe it's the way the played it in my heart
I knew one day I gotta be a star
My hopes and all my wishes
So many vivid pictures, and all the currency I'll never even get to see
This fast life soon shatter us
Cause after all the lights and screams nothing but my dreams matter
Hoping for better days maybe a peaceful night
Baby don't cry cause everythang gonna be all right
Just lay your head on my shoulder
Don't worry 'bout a thang baby girl I'm a soldier (huh)
Never treated me bad, no matter who I was
You still came with that, unconditional love

Chorus 3x until fade
In this game the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
You know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
Happiness, living on tha streets is a delusion
Even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
Shot up or shot down with tha bullet that he bought
Nine millimeter kickin' thinking about what tha streets do to me
'Cause they never talk peace in tha black community
All we know is violence, do tha job in silence
Walk tha city streets like a rat pack of tyrants
Too many brothers daily heading for tha big penn
Niggas commin' out worse off than when they went in
Over tha years I done alot of growin' up
Getten drunk thrown' up
Cuffed up
Then I said I had enough
There must be another route, way out
To money and fame, I changed my name
And played a different game
Tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle
If one more cop harassed me I just might go psycho
And when I gettem
I'll hittem with tha bum rush
Only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed
Yo, if your smart you'll really let me go 'G'
But keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch tha uzi
They got me trapped...

(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
They got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped
(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)

They got me trapped
Can barely walk tha city streets
Without a cop harassing me, searching me
Then asking my identity
Hands up, throw me up against tha wall
Didn't do a thing at all
I'm tellen you one day these suckers gotta fall
Cuffed up throw me on tha concrete
Coppers try to kill me
But they didn't know this was tha wrong street
Bang bang, down another casualty
But it's a cop who's shot there's brutality
Who do you blame?
It's a shame because tha man's slain
He got caught in tha chains of his own game
How can I feel guilty after all tha things they did to me
Sweated me, hunted me
Trapped in my own community
One day I'm gonna bust
Blow up on this society
Why did ya lie to me?
I couldn't find a trace of equality
Work me like a slave while they laid back
Homie don't play that
It's time I lett'em suffer tha payback
I'm tryin' to avoid physical contact
I can't hold back, it's time to attack jack
They got me trapped

(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
You know they got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped
(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
You know they got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)

Now I'm trapped and want to find a getaway
All I need is a 'G' and somewhere safe to stay
Can't use tha phone
'Cause I'm sure someone is tappin in
Did it before
Ain't scared to use my gat again
I look back at hindsite the fight was irrelevant
But now he's tha devils friend
Too late to be tellin' him
He shot first and I'll be damned if I run away
Homie is done away I should of put my gun away
I wasn't thinkin' all I heard was tha ridicule
Girlies was laughin', Tup sayin' Damn homies is dissin you
I fired my weapon
Started steppin' in tha hurricane
I got shot so I dropped
Feelin' a burst of pain
Got to my feet
Couldn't see nothin' but bloody blood
Now I'm a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer
Ran through an alley
Still lookin' for my getaway
Coppers said Freeze, or you'll be dead today
Trapped in a corner
Dark and I couldn't see tha light
Thoughts in my mind was tha nine and a better life
What do I do?
Live my life in a prison cell
I'd rather die than be trapped in a living hell
They got me trapped

(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
They got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped
(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
You know they got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped
How many brothas fell victim to tha streetz?
Rest in peace young nigga, there's a Heaven for a 'G'
It'd be a lie, If I told ya that I never thought of death
My niggas, we tha last ones left
But life goes on...

How many brothas fell victim to tha streetz?
Rest in peace young nigga, there's a Heaven for a 'G'
It'd be a lie, If I told ya that I never thought of death
My niggas, we tha last ones left
But life goes on...

Verse One:

As I bail through tha empty halls
Breath stinkin' in my draws
Ring, ring, ring
Quiet y'all
Incoming call
Plus this my homie from high school
He's getting bye
It's time to bury another brotha nobody cry
Life as a baller
Alchol and booty calls
We usta do them as adolecents
Do you recall?
Raised as G's
Loc'ed out and blazed the weed
Get on tha roof
Let's get smoked out
And blaze with me
2 in tha morning
And we still high assed out
Screamin' 'thug till I die'
Before I passed out
But now that you're gone
I'm in the zone
Thinkin'
'I don't wanna die all alone'
But now ya gone
And all I got left are stinkin' memories
I love them niggas to death
I'm drinkin' Hennessy
While tryin' ta make it last
I drank a 5th for that ass
When you passed...
Cause life goes on


Verse Two:

Yeah nigga
I got tha word as hell
Blew trial and tha judge gave you
25 with an L
Time to prepare to do fed time
Won't see parole
Imagine life as a convict
That's getten' old
Plus with tha drama
We're lookin' out for your babies mama
Taken risks, while keepin' cheap tricks from beatin' on her...
Life in tha hood...
Is all good for nobody
Remember gamin' on dumb hotties at your party
Me and you
No true a two
While scheming on hits
And gettin' tricks
That maybe we can slide into
But now you buried
Rest nigga
'Cause I ain't worried
Eyes blurry
Sayin' goodbye at the cemetery
Tho' memories fade
I got your name tated on my arm
So we both ball till my dying days
Before I say goodbye
Kato and Mental rest in peace
Thug till I die


Verse Three:

Bury me smilin'
With G's in my pocket
Have a party at my funeral
Let every rapper rock it
Let tha hoes that I usta know
From way before
Kiss me from my head to my toe
Give me a paper and a pen
So I can write about my life of sin
A couple bottles of Gin
In case I don't get in
Tell all my people I'm a Ridah
Nobody cries when we die
We outlaws
Let me ride
Until I get free
I live my life in tha fast lane
Got police chasen' me
To my niggas from old blocks
From old crews
Niggas that guided me through
Back in tha old school
Pour out some liquor
Have a toast for tha homies
See we both gotta die
But ya chose to go before me
And brothas miss ya while you're gone
You left your nigga on his own
How long we mourn
Life goes on...

(Chorus repeats to end)
(Spoken over repeating chorus:)

Life goes on homie
Gone on, 'cause they passed away
Niggas doin' life
Niggas doin' 50 and 60 years and shit
I feel ya nigga, trust me
I feel ya
You know what I mean
Last year
We poured out liquor for ya
This year nigga, life goes on
We're gonna clock now
Get money
Evade bitches
Evade tricks
Give players plenty space
And basically just represent for you baby
Next time you see your niggas
Your gonna be on top nigga
Their gonna be like,
'Goddamn, them niggas came up'
That's right baby
Life goes on...
And we up out this bitch
Hey Kato, Mental
Y'all niggas make sure it's popin' when we get up there
Don't front.

(Reporter)

Good Evening (sirens in the background)
I'm reporting live from Sunset Boulevard
Where many excited fans have gathered with candles
(Crowd starts chanting "Tupac")
Awaiting the much anticipated release, of Tupac Shakur's latest album, Better Dayz
This is yet another post-humorous release by Tupac
Which, raises the question
Where are these songs coming from?
It's interesting how, the message in these songs
Is still relevant today
Even in his death, he's touching people with his lyrics
I can feel the energy in the air, as they count down to midnight
When the album will officially be released
Oh, hold on, I, think they're starting to countdown now

(Crowd)

5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ...
Troublesome nigga
Troublesome 19-motherfucking-96
Westside
Let it be known nigga
The boss of all bosses
Makaveli

Menacing Methods, Label me a lethal weapon
Making niggas die, witnessin' breathless imperfection
Can you picture my specific plan?
To be the man in this wicked land, underhanded hits are planned
Scams are plotted over grams and rocks
Undercover agents die by the random shots
We all die in the end, so revenge we swore
I was all about my ends fuck friends and foes
Me, a born leader, never leave the block without my heater
Got me a dog and named her mob bitch nigga eater
What could they do to me ya little brat
Shit them niggas done shot me and still terrified I'll cut they ass
How can I show you how I feel inside
We outlawz, motherfuckas can't kill my pride
Niggas talk a lot of shit but that's after I'm gone
'Cause they fear me in the physical form
Let it be known I'm troublesome

Troublesome nigga
Outlawz
We put it down to the fullest
Spitting rhymes and bullets
Troublesome
Y'all know what time it is
Call the punk police, they can't stop us
Niggas run the streets Haha...
Troublesome
Yeah

Gutter ways, my mentality is ghetto
A guerrilla in this criminal war, we all rebels
Death before dishonor, bet I bomb on them first
Niggas knew we came for murda, pullin' up in a herse
Westside was the war cry bustin' all freely
Screaming fuck all ya niggas in Swaheli
Pistol packin' fresh out of jail, I ain't goin' back
Release me to the care of my heartless trap
Say my name three times like Candyman
Bet I roll on your ass like an avalanche
A soul survivor, learned to get high and pull driveby's
Murder my foes, can't control my nine
Hearin' thoughts of my enemies pleadin' please
Busta ass motherfuckas tried to flee
Picture me lettin this chump survive
Ran up on his ass when I dump he died
'Cause I'm troublesome

Young, strapped, and I don't give a fuck
I'm hopelesssss
I live a thuglife, losing my focus baby
I'm troublesome
Badboy Killa
There is no one realler
What you saw was the rough, rugged and raw
Outlaw OUTLAW

Murder murder my mindstate shit ain't change since my last rhyme
The crime rate ain't declined
Niggas bustin' shots like they lost their mind
Like twenty-five to life never crossed their mind
Tell me young nigga never learned a thang
Dead at thirteen 'cause he yearn to bang
Sent a lot of flowers, but how can I cry
Try to warn the little nigga either stop or die
Mercy is for the weak when I speak I scream
Afraid to sleep I'm havin' crazy dreams
Vivid' pictures of my enemies and family times
God forgive me cause its wrong but I plan to die
You can take me in heaven and understand I was a sheep
Did the best I could, raised in insanity
Or send me to hell 'cause I ain't beggin' for my life
Ain't nothing worse than this cursed ass hopeless life
I'm troublesome

In your wildest dreams you couldn't picture a nigga like me
I'm troublesome I don't give a fuck
I'm troublesome
Like my nigga napolean said nigga
Somebody gotta explain why I ain't got shit
I'm troublesome
You know what time it is
The outlaw click, young rugged and sick
Makaveli the don, the boss of all bosses
Mussolini, Idi Amin, Hussein Fatal, Khadafi
Kastro, Napoleon, Mo Khomani
We ain't fucking around
We troublesome
Hey yo
We troublesome
Young Kastro, the first to blast the last one to dash
He going for the hoes and the cash
Fuck you niggas
Outlaws
Khadafi trump tight never sloppy
Them other fuckers try to copy
But they can't mock you nigga u 2 strong
Outlaw keep it going on
You know wassup
Outlaws outlaws
Outlaws outlaws
This is dedicated to the real niggas
All the real troublesome soldiers on the streets
That rather die than see the penitentiary
We all motherfuckin' outlaws

Bye bye
Bye bye
All you niggas die
(2Pac - over background voices)
My ghetto love song, hahaha, let's be friends...
(Where my niggaz at? Where my niggaz where my bitches?
Where my niggaz at? Where my bitches at?
Throw your hands in the air
Everybody just throw your hands in the air)
Let's be friends...
(Wessyde in this motherfucker right here, Wessyde..)

(2Pac)
Approach you and post a minute, arm on my double-R tinted
As you pass bye wink in my eye, freshly scented
What's the haps baby? Come get with me and perhaps lady
You can help me multiply my stacks baby
Currency seems small I need companionship (hey)
Through with that - scandalous shit, I bet your man ain't shit
So why you hesitating actin' like yo' shit don't stink
Check out my - diamonds bitch everyone gonna blink
This be a thug thang, Outlaw nigga with riches
Cream dreaming motherfucker, on a mash for bitches
Check my resume, sipping on Cristal and Alize
Smoking on big weed, keyed the Cali way
Don't like tricking but I'll buy you a fifth
I can't stand no sneaker-wearing nappy head bitch
Let my pedigree, re-breed me, they're so cheap
Putting bitch-made busters to sleep with no grief
Mash on my so-called comp, who the man?
While I'm tugging on yo' main bitch head
Understand this, ain't no nigga like me, fuck Jay-Z
He broke and I smoke daily baby let's be friends

(Chorus: singer + 2Pac)
Let's be friends (where my niggaz at? come on)
You ain't gotta be my man at all, long as you just bring me your
Friends... (all my niggaz, where my hoes at?)
Why you trickin on them other hoes?
Let's be friends (where the bitches at, where the niggaz with money?)
(Where you at baby?)
You ain't gotta be my man at all, long as you just bring me your
Friends... (cash makin' hoes)
Why you trickin on them other hoes?
Let's be friends

(2pac)
I met you and I stuttered in passion
Though slightly blinded by that ass, it was hard to keep my dick in my pants
Every time you pass got me checkin' for you hardcore; staring and watching
Me and you one on one (see that bitch) picture countless options
Was it prophecy? Clear as day, visions on top of me
Erotic, psychotic, we possess bubonics
Far from a crush I wanna bust your guts and touch
Everything inside you from my head to my nuts
You got me sweating like a fat girl goin' for mine
Just a skinny nigga fucking like she stole my mind
Back in time I recall how she used to be
I guess money and fame made you used to me
What's up in 9-6? Fine tricks in drag
Fuck Dre, tell that bitch he can kiss my ass
Back to you, my pretty ass caramel queen
Got my hands on your thighs now, let me in between as friends

(Chorus: singer + 2Pac)
Let's be friends (wessyde, motherfucker right here)
You ain't gotta be my man at all, long as you just bring me your
Friends... (wessyde in this motherfucker)
Why you trickin on them other hoes?
Let's be friends (wessyde in this motherfucker right here)
You ain't gotta be my man at all, long as you just bring me your
Friends... (in this motherfucker right here)
Why you trickin on them other hoes?
Let's be friends

(2Pac)
Can you imagine me in player mode, rush the tricks
I got 'em ready for a booty call, I fucked your bitch
Was it me or the fame? My dick or the game?
Bet I scream WESTSIDE when I came
Scream my name, cause baby it's delicious got a weak spot
For pretty bitches up and down, similar to switches
My movement, baby let your back get into it
Make it fluid, in and out, all around when a nigga do it
You got me high! Let me come inside!
I love it when you get on top, baby let me ride!
Who wanna stop me? Am I top notch?
Fuck player hating niggaz 'cause they cock block
You probably hate to see a real thug with vision, what's the game?
Rather see a nigga up in prison, why you change?
Made a living out of cuss words, liquor and weed
A bad seed turned good - in this world of G's
Baby got me fantasizing, seeing you naked
It's the fuck song, so check my record
And let's be friends
(Where my niggaz at? Show me where my niggaz at?
Where my bitches at) Thug style!

(Chorus: singer + 2Pac)
Let's be friends (where my niggaz at, where my bitches at?)
(Throw yo' guns in the air!)
Friends... (my ghetto love song, it goes on and on and on and on)
Let's be friends (where my niggaz at, where my bitches at?)
(Where my niggaz at?)
Friends... (where my niggaz at, where my bitches at?)
(Where my people at? Let's be..)

(2Pac)
Where my people at? Show me where my people at
Where my people at? Show me where my people at

Be friends, tell me where my niggaz at
Be friends, tell me where my bitches at
Be friends, tell me where my people at
Be friends, tell me where my bitches at
Make money, take money, be friends

(Chorus: singer + 2Pac)
Let's be friends (get your cash on, let's, get dough)
You ain't gotta be my man at all, long as you just bring me your
Friends... (c'mon, get your cash on)
Why you trickin on them other hoes?
Let's be friends (c'mon, get your cash on, let's, get paid)
You ain't gotta be my man at all, long as you just bring me your
Friends... (c'mon, getcha cash on)
Why you trickin on them other hoes?
Let's be friends

Make money, take money! (*repeat 5X*)
Lets turn this house into a happy home
This is for all the homeboys that couldn't get their happy home
Lets turn this house into a happy home

As long one of us got it some of us got it
Lets turn this house into a happy home
You know how that is, stay down for me boo
Hold on

Now we been kicking it for quite some time
Remain beside me through these trials and this life of crime
We done fought so many times I forgot to count
I never hit you, not a coward rather leave your house
Remember back in December when we was tight
Sippin alize and crystal while in every night
In my bedroom, promise that I'll commit to you sometime
Kiss me every time you see me step inside a room
Promise to be good to each other
Plus I love ya so I know your gonna make a good mother
Just try to understand if I change in time
It's only 'cause I never owned anything that's mine
So I'm trying
You can stay with my mama but keep the drama to a low
Never call the police, I never call you bitch or hoe
We were all born hungry in this world alone
Finally moved out my mom's house
And got a happy home

Happy Home
Lets turn the house into a happy home
Happy Home
Finally made it outta moms house, and got a happy home
Happy Home
Turn this house into a happy home
Happy Home


Going through these hard times
Ghetto child of mine
I wonder if you have to suffer for your fathers crimes
To be honest it's a hard road
Just keep your faith in God knowing you'll get scarred though
Look at him walking and talking, a little child with my eyes and mouth
Father watch over little seeds help me guide them out
Had to change my whole lifestyle
Married my baby's mama made her my wife now
I'm trying hard y'all
Maybe in time, I'll be a better man
Watchin the older couples, handle it like veterans
Show me the meaning of together and forever we rise
If it would help our child grow then together we die
Why, question my love? It's so easy to see
Without my family all I'm left with is a shadow of me
After all the arguments and the nights alone
Now it's time to live the good life
Inside this happy home

Happy Home
Turn this house into a happy home
Happy Home
Finally got to live the good life, inside this happy home
Happy Home
Turn this house into a happy home
Happy Home

Happy Home

(Tupac talking)
All these problems got me gone
We got a family of our own
I just want a happy home
Turn this house into a happy home
No man's made to stand alone
I promise I won't do you wrong
I just want a happy home
Finally made it outta moms house, and got a happy home

Happy Home
Turn this house into a happy home
Happy Home
Finally got to live the good life, inside this happy home
Happy Home
Turn this house into a happy home
Happy Home

Hey
Turn this house into a happy home
As long one of us got it some of us got it
Turn this house into a happy home
(LT Hutton talking)

Uh oh, Uh oh, Oh!, Oh!, Oh!
They ain't ready for this

Ashanti
It's that new 'Pac y'all

(Chorus: Ashanti)

Pac's life
(Everybody need's to chill)
Everybody talking 'bout Pac's life
(It's Tupac the king)
What do you know about Pac's life
(What do you know? What do you know?)
(Only real niggas stay on top)
Everybody talking 'bout Pac's life
(Outlawz)

(Verse One: Tupac)

Started with five shots, niggas plotting to kill him
Never figured that, that same nigga sell five million
Hit the charts like a mad man nothing but hits
Court cases got a nigga facing multiple digits
Dodging cop cars look how we come so far
Picture a high school drop out
Rolling a double R
House full of happiness, weed and drank
Way out
So when trouble tried to find me can't
Never visioned living longer than my twenty first
Thought I'd locked down, cracked out or in the dirt
And though it hurts to see the change
It comes with the fame
Watch them gossip in this silly game
To all the motherfucker's speaking down on me this is the night
Why's everybody caught up In Pac's life?
To all y'all niggas
Conversating on my life
Mind your motherfucking business


(Verse Two: T.I)

I remember that
Ay
What's happening Pac
Yeah I know we never got to meet
But we know all the same people so we got to speak
You taught me first, fake nigga can't stop a G
And all the shit you went through
Meant a lot to me
But when they locked you up for for nothing it was shame to see
You we know the crack came and did the same thing to me
I get along with real niggas it's the lane to be
Talking loud out of pocket tryna bang with me
And so I pull it out my pocket let it rain you see
Now they all in the court room blaming me
See we ain't live the same life but represent the same struggle
Power to the real niggas death to the sucker's
Money over bitches, get to know 'em for you love 'em
Death before dishonour never talk to undercover's
Live by the same rules so I minus the tattoo's
With the same sort of dude with he same short fuse


(Verse Three: Tupac)

I want money in large amounts
My garage full of cars that bounce
Moving my tapes in major weight cause every dollar counts
Busters is jealous and half these niggas is punks
They running off at the mouth till I fill it up with my pump
They jump my automatic keep 'em weary
While you fronting like you Billy Bad Ass
Nigga you scary
I been knowing you for years
We was high school peers
In Junior High
I was itching' to kill
And you was, 'Ready To Die'
While you bullshitting niggas was dying and catching cases
Busting my automatics at motherfucker's in foreign places
Leaving no trace, they see my face and then they buried
Bitches die in a hurry
Still I ride, I'm never worried
Mr. Makaveli tell me to ride and I'ma ride
Pick my enemies out the crowd
And motherfucker's die
It's not the way I wanna live
My nigga it's how it is
Only real niggas stay on top


Why are all you niggas all up in my shit?
Tell them motherfucker's
Outlawz
Fuck all y'all

It's gettin' crazy, it's hard to make my mind up
Now should I bucm em' down and put my 9 up?
Ya see, I ain't a Bad Boy, jus' a boy that had it bad
I graduated from 22's to 357 mags.
Runnin' on these marks for they stash and I ain't askin
Givin' up or get the blastin'.
The penitentiary don't scare me
A str8 thug nigga... hoes say they'll take care of me.
And tell me who the fuck you goin' find?
Rough enough to tell these bitch niggaz this is mine
Now busta meet my 9!

Raise up off these nuts, a little bit
Just a little bit
Raise up off these nuts, a little bit

(2Pac)
I'm smokin' these niggas like they endo
Breakin 'em like they windows
And still they rip till they get a whiff
Of this shit that I kick
And if they ever had a notion to stop me
Treat your best shot and get dropped
With your posse, nigga I got the ?mott?
I'm takin' 'em out, a lot I got
More than you could pop
I'm rockin' the spot, so now they jock
Dump 'em and get dropped
2Pac ain't tryin' to hear it, Ox
Screamin at your box
I'm swearin at ya not so uh
Static is the last thing you need when you see me
Better have a bat or a gat to defeat me
Nigga, I'm a whole posse rolled into one shot
Takin' on your gat while your girl gets hot and rocks the spot
Fear funky flavor with the gift that only God gave
Hold it to my grave
I'd rather die than be a slave
Slaves come as dope dealers
Some come as addicts
Some come to run while the others cause static

Raise up off these nuts, a little bit
Just a little bit
Raise up off these nuts, a little bit

(???)
I'm comin' up outta the cut
Sendin slugs to the guts
I'm bustin' up outta the page 'cause they got me locked up
I'm tryin' to survive but there's too many playa hatin' haters
Always want static, like boom holla at ya later
Homie this ain't no love in this town that I come from
Niggas be wantin funkin then I stomp em, they don't want none
Girls be on my jock and they playin' me for that
But fool I can't help it 'cause I was raised up like a mack
Jealous because I'm black, Jack wanna jack me
And Jill wants to marry me and watch the Klan bury me
Got to pack the steel for the personal protection
AK, 45's, assault rifles, Smith and Wesson
I'm no longer stressin
Learnin, gotta live long
(..?..) Thanks God that I'm still strong
Get a bag a spliffs for the homies, blaze up all of these
But if you wanna flex, get in my Kool Aid punks, raise up offa
These

Raise up off these nuts, a little bit
Just a little bit
Raise up off these nuts, a little bit

(Silky)
Just back the fuck up of me, 'cause you can't get none a these
It's that OG female comin' straight up out the PP's
So step to the side then raise the fuck up off me, brah
'Cause if I take it to that level I'ma light this motherfucker up
Now it's on you, you better try to lose your shit
'Cause if you don't, trust me I got you trick
You better try to choose it and lose it
Stay outta mine 'fore this shit get way stupid
These niggas I fuck with believe in passin gats
Can't leave hoe, without my strap
Not givin' a fuck about nothin'
Slidin through the spot with my face mask muggin
Lookin' motherfuckers up and down
It ain't a future in your frontin
Why these fat niggas floatin around?
What happened to them real motherfuckin G's?
Fake motherfuckers need to raise up offa these

Raise up off these nuts, a little bit
Just a little bit
Raise up off these nuts, a little bit

Raise up off these nuts, a little bit
Just a little bit
Raise up off these nuts, a little bit
Layin around sittin' about from Friday morning to Saturday evenings Monday morning x2
(Notorious BIG)
Check it
I grew up a fucking screwup
Got introduced to the game
Got a ounce and fucking blew up

Chopping rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls trying
Ta turn into the black Frank White


It's a red light
How many homies gotta die tonight?
Oh, yeah, stop the gunfight
I can feel it
Somebody's trying to start up a fight

Come on and keep game, uh oh
But you cannot cease the blame
And if you ask me, it's a damn shame
We be taking lives that we can't replace

Over B.S. that don't make sense
We gotta get better than this
We started fighting at our own risk
It was something we couldn't resist
It's a red light

How many homies gotta die tonight?

(Notorious BIG)
We had to grow dreads
To change our description
Two cops is on a milkbox missing

Showed they toes
You know they got stepped on
A fistful of bullets
A chest full of Teflon

Run from the police, picture that
Nigga I'm too fat
I fuck around and
Catch a asthma attack

That's why I bust back
It don't faze me
When he drop, take his glock
And I'm Swayze

Celebrate my escape
Sold the glock, bought some weight
Laid back, I got some money to make
Motherfucker

(2pac)
From the five-oh
Ducking and dodging and my survival
Depends on when I let off with my nine-oh

I'm moving swifter
Than the next nigga
No time for sex
'Cause in my mind
All I wonder is who's next

Nigga, my homey slipped
And now he pays the price
He did a drive-by, sixteen
Now he's doin' triple life

Tell me is it me or my upbringing
I spit that thug shit
Nigga motherfuck singing

I hope you got your
Timberlands on tight
'Cause I ain't givin' up
I'd rather duck these
Motherfuckers all night

I'm running through
The projects, beyotch
They'll never catch me
'Cause I'm loc'd and trigger happy
On the sneotch

Don't say you never heard of me
Till they murder me, I'm a legend
Do Thug Niggas go to heaven

I'm rolling with the thorough heads
We getting ghost on them hoes and yo
I got no love for the five-oh
I'm running from the police

Stop the gunfight
I can feel it
Somebody's trying to
Start up a fight

Come on and keep game, uh oh
But you cannot cease the blame
And if you ask me, it's a damn shame
We be taking lives that we can't replace

You got swishes in your system
Juice up in
Now you're red again
Over what he said
Over what she said
Now somebody gotta end up dead
Ya know...

Where you from soul dawg?? West side nigga!!
Yeah! ha ha yeah... that's right!
The F.A's comin' striaght from the wild wild west

Look at baby girl born in 19-7-deuce
Pop's on his fix, Mom's stuck on that crazy juice
Went to school, It's all cool but in Junior Hiiigh
Little hooker in the bathroom getting hiiigh
What she doing and what she smoking, nobody knows
Is she addicted or just slipping into melbose
A bad ass broad running with the girl gang
Just got some tat's, Talking all that girl slang.
First one to slap, because La vida don't matter
Wip out a cuete watch your brains get splattered
Selling them doves, hanging with thugs and all that
Beating up fools with a baseball bat
Started having sex at only 14
Imagine O.G. wears his clothes all crisp and clean
Got pregnant had a baby in December
She wont see the daddy till next September
Mom's and Pop's gave her the boot
Kicked her out La Casa, Now what Raza
With the money she got, She bought a spot of the block
Started paying the rent by slangin' phat ass coca rocks
Now she's 23 her four kids all alone, and loc'ed out
And plus she's all smoked out, the base face
You could see it in her eyes, it could also tell the tears
Of a life long cries.
They was headed for self destruction
Conjunction Junction,(hey Yo!) What's your Function?
Her own kids gotta healp, 'cause they knew she was slippin'
Took the devil away homegiiirl, You was Slippin'.

Slipping into Darkness
When you slip you trip and fall
Slipping into Darkness
Ain't no sense to give y'all no love at all

They say we're slipping, as a whole one race
So, what we gonna choose, Don't want the blues
I turn to the news and what do I see
(Merciless)"Everybody in the world ready to D. I. E."
We got blacks against blacks, browns against browns
Whites against whites, from governments to undergrounds
So, Peep the sound as it bumps through your stereo
Ear to your brain now check out the scenerio
Cali got quakes, Mudslides, and Floods
Pesadillas (nightmares) Crips and Bloods
Hustlas, Pimps, Shot Callers, and Killas
O.G., Macks, and the big Coca Dealers
We got homeboys who just like kicking it
And Vato's like me who grab the mic and start splitting it
(Merciless) "You're in for a phat treat trip into a phat beat"
So get closer to the funk and slip into the backseat.


They wanna band me cause a brothas makin' noise a lot
Ill shoot they ass in a sec wit a poison dart
They got me runnin' down the street gettin' hotter
Runnin' from the cops as I try to clock my glock
The war wont stop
That's why they wanna band the music
You ever notcie how the cops can't stand the music
See a black man coolin wit a Mexican
We can all have peace, the sun sets again
They try to shove us in the pen
But we clown and we frown every time we hit the top ten
Once again, it's your friend outta oakland, hopin
To keep the hip hop clubs open
Now we can lay back and let them close'm
Or we can have beef and show that we control'em
Now ain't nobody gettin' paid, it's a damn shame
Why gang bang brothas in the same gang?
They say securitys to blame, 'cause they lettin it off
Brothas come to have fun but they settin it off
One time, make it worse when they sweat us
Send an army of pigs to come get us
Now I'm runnin' outta time and I'm cool down with the aztecs
This is sorta like soul food
(Tupac Shakur)
Right now, it is it is almost... it is almost uh,
IMPOSSIBLE for you not to see how strong rap has gotten
Why'knowhatI'msayin, it's it's like umm...
Our our brothers and sisters, our youths, and some of our adults
Their ear is PINNED to rap music right now
And if you really wanna get our message out
And really wanna start teachin, we need to start doin' that
We we really need to start usin', our methods, why'knowhatI'msayin?
The Last Poets did it with poetry
And uh, and and... even in our history
From a ancient Afl- African civilization
Poets went from village to village
And that's how, stories and messages and lessons were taught
Why'knowhatI'mssayin, and so like you say, history repeats itself
And so... it it was, it was... at it was, why'know obvious
It was, pick it up, why'know?
Bein the race that we are, bein the strong race that we are
We picked it up, we picked up those positive, those positive vibes
And we started rappin' and so
I think it is, it's a very good medium too
(Babatunde Olatunki)
Please... wake me when I am free
I cannot bear activity
Where my couch, I am told, "Hold no significance"
I waited and died in ignorance
But my inner eye can see, erase
Who reigned as king in another place
The green trees were reached from fall
And every man spoke of beautiful men and women together as people

War was gone because all was at peace
But now like a nightmare, I woke to see

That I live like a prisoner of poverty...

Please... wake me when I am free
I cannot bear activity
Fall, I will have a ?, stricken blind
Than to live without expression of mind

(Babatunde Olatunki begins to speak in another language)
(Mos Def)
This song is dedicated
To the mothers and the children of the revolution
From Tupac, to Afeni Shakur
And many many more
This is for you
One love, one life

(Mos Def * singing)
Can you see... the pride of the panther
As she nurtures... her young all alone
It's the seed... that must grow regardless
Of the fact that, it's been planted in stone
Can you see... the pride of the panther
In the concrete jungle, alone with her cub
It's the seed... that must come to harvest
It's the tree... that must grow out of love

Can you see the pride in the panther
As he glows in splendor and grace?
Topling obstacles placed
In the way of the progression of his race?
Can you see the pride in the panther
As she nurtures her young, all alone?
The seed must grow regardless
Of the fact that it's planted in stone
Can't you see the pride of the panthers
As they unify, as one?
The flower blooms with brilliance and
Outshines all the rays of the sun
Keeps bright like the rays of the sun
Carries out like the rays of the sun
Keeps bright like the rays of the sun
Shines bright like a new day begun

(Mos Def)
Can you see the pride in the panther

Topling the obstacles placed

Can you see the pride in the panther

The seed must grow, regardless
Of the fact that it's been planted in stone
Can't you see the pride of the panthers
As they unify as one?
The flower blooms, with brilliance
And outshines all the rays of the sun
It outshines all the rays of the sun
Carries out like a new day begun (uh-huh)
It shines bright like the rays of the sun (hah)
And keeps high like a new day begun

(Mos Def * singing)
Shines bright like the rays of the SUN!
Keeps high like a new day begun
Carry out like the rays of the sun
Keep on like a new day begun, say
Shine bright like the rays of the SUN!
Keep high like a new day begun, say
Shine bright like the rays of the sun (c'mon)
Keep high like a new day begun, say
Shine bright like the rays of the SUN!
Keep high like a new day begun, yes
To shine bright like the rays of the sun (uh-huh)
Carry out like a new day begun, say (c'mon)

Keep high like a new day begun (ha ha)
Shine bright like the rays of the sun say (c'mon)
Keep it high like the new day begin say
SHINE BRIGHT LIKE THE RAYS OF THE SUN (whoo!)
Keep high like a new day begun (ha ha)
Shine bright like the rays of the sun (yeah)

Carry out like a new day begun
A new day begun, a new day begun
A new day begun begun begun begun
Begun begun begun... hoo!

He said... love is people power (LOVE)
Love is people power (LOVE)
Love is people power (LOVE)
Love is people power (when all else crumbles)
Love is people power (love must prevail)
Love is the people's power
God
When I was alone, and had nothing
I asked for a friend to help me bear the pain
No one came, except God
When I needed a breath to rise, from my sleep
No one could help me, except God
When all I saw was sadness, and I needed answers
No one heard me, except God
So when I'm asked, who I give my unconditional love to?
I look for no other name, except God
This one is all about love
Love, love, oh no
(Oh yeah)
This one is for my baby boo
(That's you)
Now what's about baby
(That's right)
Red Rat will always love you, always

Yo bean or not molest me of you
Prepare to die or say you want me too
I would do anything for make you my baby boo
Remember that I still love you

Yo bean or not molest me of you
Prepare to die or say you want me too
I want to hear my baby boo
And this one is just for you, just for you

I would jump all my girls for you
Walk around the world for you
Fly around like the birds for you
That's why I wrote these words for you

I don't have everything
I sometimes wonder why
I don't have anything
(Yeah)
From my heart
(Definitely)

Yo, accept the G of a better day
(Yeah)
And you tell me find my way
(Yeah, yeah baby, yeah)

But be the man I'm sure to make me stay
(Everybody does)
But to keep you, I'll do all it takes
(Anything)
Of course, yeah

Men you think you're nor'
Hold you but you're cloa'
Give me a chance for sure and I'll show
I'm really the one you know
(Know)
This is not a flo'
(Flo')
Can we stick to the Red Cross? Yo

And if it meant that my love was really true
(Yeah)
I'd gladly die and watch over you
(Believe that)
I wish you know how much I cared

You'd see my love is true, that love we'd share
(Of course)
Believe that yo
Even if you change your mind
And said our love was through
I'll die, I would cry but I'll still love you
(Yeah)

Yo, yo bean or not molest me of you
Prepare to die or say you want me too
I would do anything to make you my baby boo
If it don't work I still love you

It's for our love, no matter what
I'll still love you
(I love you)
 Ooh Ooh  Tell me I will be there
Tell me I will be there
Tell me I will be there
Tell me I will be there
Yeah...

(Verse 1]   [Providence and RasDaveed El Harar)
If there be pain
Every breath I breathe will be into you
For without you here my joy is through
My life was lived through falling rain
So call on me if there be pain

If you need me
If you need me
When your hero falls from grace, all fairy tales are uncovered
Myth exposed and pain magnified, the grace pays uncovered
He told me to be strong, but I confused to see it so weak
You say never to give up, and it hurts to see what comes to be
When your hero falls solely the stars, and so does the reception of tomorrow
Without my hero, there's only me alone, to deal with my sorrow
Your heart ceases to work, and your soul is not happy at all
What are you expected to do, when your only hero falls

As long as some suffer, the river flows forever
As long as there is pain, the river flows forever
As strong as a smile can be, the river will flow forever
And as long as you are with me, we'll ride the river together
And as long as you are with me, we'll ride the river together

We'll ride, the river together, as long as, you are with me
The river, will flow forever, as long as, you are with me
The river, will flow forever, as long as, you are with me
Starry night, an unknown creation
Written by, and from the archives of Tupac Shakur
Dedicated to the memory of Vincent Van Gogh

A creative heart obsessed with satisfying
This dorment and uncaring society
You have given them the stars at night
And you have given them bountiful bouquets of sunflowers
But for you there's only contempt
Though you pour yourself into that frame and present it so proudly
This world could not accept your masterpieces, from the heart
So on that starry night, you gave to us and you took away from us
The one thing we never acknowledged, your life

Yeah, game laid down by Q, why'knawmsayin?
Vocals by Rasheeda, fly beat by QDIII
And flows by the M-A-see why'all, Mr. M-A-see Mall

Starry night, your life
You gave to us, and took away from us
Starry night, your life
You gave to us, and took away from us

Uh, uh, watch me live my art; writing words from my soul in blood
I speak the truth on every thang I love
I'll probably sacrifice my life, to send my message through mics
It's like a war drum calling soldiers at night
It's bigger than music I spit it straight from the heart
So it's cold n dark and deep like a universe, but nah don't start
It's for ya entertainment but it's my life why all
And I can't rewind, fast forward, or press pause
But when you give your all, it's like the fans demand more
And after the tour I sit alone like before
When ya name is hot it's all love, the world is yours
But when you fall off, you get ignored

You on the cover of da magazine, flossing on the TV screen
Toastin' wit yo' champagne, playin' life like a game
Loaded in the limousine, love to hear the fans scream
Swimmin' wit the sharks now, ain't no love money king
People got they hands out but ain't nobody lendin' hands
Can you really blame dem for tryin' to get what they can?
Late night, bright lights, lust n lies
And anythang goes under the Hollywood sign
Well you might lose ya soul and who knows what you find
But go ahead main we all want to shine
But go ahead main we all want to shine

There you have it
Why'know, when I was younger I prayed, to get in this game
Why'know to hold dis microphone in my hand
I asked the man upstairs, to let me rock a crowd one day
Why'know let people out there feel the way I feel through my music
Like my homeboy Tupac did fo' sho'
And he gave that to me
But he didn't he didn't he didn't let me know
About all the shady shit that's in, in between
You and yo' dream, why'know?
See it's more than the music, I spit it from the heart
So sometime it's cold n it's dark, but it's raw
And that's how I'ma bring it to you every time, why'know?
(4th Avenue Liberty Jones, K-Ci)
Tat chat, chat, ooh, 4th Avenue Jones
K-Ci himself
(Himself, himself)
Shabba dabba dee swee swee
Ha, ha, oh, yeah, lemme tell you now, oh, yeah

I never planned that I'd be married to settle, no chance
(Yeah)
Wedding bands rock the heaviest metal
And I'm the center hip hop
My M3 seat three, don't need commission
(That's right)

So either we rhyme or design the beat to flip with
Don't stick with music 'cause I hand lose it
It serenades me while I land cruise it
If I'm stressed or soothing

Something I can make the fans move with
Said I be singing till I saw you was like man, who this?
While JD Mingle be gettin' at you with a brand new twist
Switchin' my linger, wishin' I could be the one you cling to
I ask you for you number maybe I can ring you

Six months later when I'm sick my baby bringin' me food
Hang with the fellas, I said, "Mainly, I'll be hangin' with you"
Ready to have that satisfaction of you saying I do
(Yeah)
Since you finally did it, now we together mind, body, spirit
That's something can't no body interfere with, for life
(For life)

4 life, my wife 4 life
You say yes
Yes, you will be my wife
My wife, my wife

4 life, my wife 4 life
You say yes
Yes, you will be my wife
My wife, my wife

I bet you be strapped at point little pubs
Said she never give her number out to dudes in the clubs
That's the boogies and exceptions
'Cause she's showing me love
Body bangin' like the county but I avoid the rub

Prolly to use to dudes jockin', all I asked was a hug
So she slid me the digits, mashed out in a bug
A couple months pass, and we the item 'round town but
I'm feelin' like the worm, like she just want me for the rebound

She fresh outta, relationships that only got her
Heartache and pain, frustrated because of drama
I'm look at your face picturing kids and I can see em
Till death do us part we got the match and mazzaliam

On poppa's DM, I'll put you in the chrome BM
You different from the rest you love God and MCing
Whether it be tattoo, rings or bling
(Bling)
50 karat, you my wife 4 life, we got our backs and it's apparent

4 life, my wife 4 life
You say yes
Yes, you will be my wife
My wife, my wife

4 life, my wife 4 life
You say yes
Yes, you will be my wife
My wife, my wife

So you heard when I asked that night you'd be my wife
Not for this year or next but mine for all life
(That's right, that's right)
To accept me when I'm seein' and to understand
Not to make this dim in the rain which comes as hard as any

I'm not the best of men
My fault has come scarce tonight
But my heart has always been to give to my wife
Yes, you are, baby
(Ah, ah, Tina Jones)

Tina Jones, been picky bout men
Don't want some common fella
Contaminatin' me like salmonella
Workin' undercover like my rhyme umbrella

Keepin' it shady, I'm not going for it though, not even maybe
Showin' proof to you the difference from a rag and from a lady
I can do for myself, makin' my bacon living gravy
And thankin' the Lord 'cause more importantly he saved me

I shot for the moon, lookin' for comets like I'm Haley
I found me a star companionship is what it gave me
I'm beautiful too and not because my hair is wavy
"That's my baby", I said

4 life, my wife 4 life
You say yes
Yes, you will be my wife
My wife, my wife

4 life, my wife 4 life
You say yes
Yes, you will be my wife
My wife, my wife

4 life, my wife 4 life
You say yes
Yes, you will be my wife
My wife, my wife

4 life, my wife 4 life
You say yes
Yes, you will be my wife
My wife, my wife
Because we all spring from different trees
Does not mean we are not created equally
Is the true beauty in the tree
Or in the vast forest in which it breathes?

I find greatness in the tree, that grows against all odds
It blossoms in darkness, and gives birth to promising pods
I was that tree that grew from the weeds and wasn't meant to be
Ashamed I'm not, in fact I am proud, of my thriving, family, tree

The rose that grew from concrete, yeah
The tree that wasn't meant to be
Though I, struggle in my life, I never give up
And you, know that I, will always be by your side
My family tree, yeah a family tree
Yeah, my family tree, my family tree

I find, greatness in the tree that grows against all odds
It blossoms in, darkness, and gives birth to a promising pod
You'll never see me give up

I will press on, never hold my head alone
Never no, my family tree, my family tree yeah
My family tree, family tree

Because we all spring from different trees
Does not mean we are not created equally
Is the true beauty in the tree
Or in the vast forest in which it breathes?

The tree must fight to breathe
Among the evils of the weeds

I find greatness in the tree, that grows against all odds
Ashamed I'm not, in fact I am proud, of my thriving, family, tree
Love within a storm
Love within a storm
Love within a storm
Love within a storm

First it was nothin', not even, a fake?
Loneliness was a daily for me, until you came along
There was a gleam of a star in your eyes
Thought I'd never feel this way again
And you were supposed to reach my heart
And find love within, love, love

Love within a storm
Love within a storm
Love within a storm
Love within a storm
This sweet, wonderful ghetto love
This sweet, wonderful love that you give me
Wonderful

I could not ignore the magnetism, when I felt you near
Any problems plaguin' my mind, was suddenly disappeared
It was re-birth of my heart, the day that you became my friend
'Cause I knew for the moment I held you, that I would fall in love again

Fall in love again, in a storm
Love within a storm (Continues in background throughout next verses)

Just when I thought I'd seen it all
Our paths crossed, amen
And I knew, from the first glance
That you, would be hard to forget
Your eyes, attracted me first
But you reeked of sultry confidence
I couldn't wait, to touch lips
And kiss, with my heart's intention
When we didn't, was what I expected
And for that moment, we erased the tension
Of the awkwardness, of first date jitters
And the initial blind date, first impressions
We kissed again; and I felt the passion
And this, my love, was Cupid's blessin'

We made love, within a storm
In the midst of passion and chaos
Somewhere, somehow, our true bond of friendship was lost
In the eye of the storm, the rain always falls harder
Those who prevail this drama
Will learn to bring their love farther
But now, the storm has past
And the seas of our friendship are gone
But as long as I live, I will remember
The love within a storm

(Love within a storm is repeated after every line)
Sweet, passionate, love-lusting love
Ya know that I miss you, and love you
Ya know that Tupac broke my heart
We need to hear ya, hear ya voice
They say, this ghetto fabulous
On 125th street forkin' around
This village, and the village uptown
South Central, Compton, Philly
Sha-Town, Southside
It's hot in 'Lanta, hot in 'Lanta
Jersey peeps, I hear ya
Miami, South Beach, uh
Yeah, got love for you, love for you
My Brooklyn knights lovin' you, lovin' me
This open, rich city
Ya know, I got love for you
(Intro: 2Pac)

Yeah, Ballad of a Dead Soulja
Its just the Ballad of a Dead Soulja
This is the Ballad of a Dead Soulja
Ballad of a Dead Soulja

(2Pac)
The plan to take command of the whole family
Though underhanded to be the man it was planned
All my road dogs official mob figures love to act up
The first to bomb when we rob niggas
I could be lost in my own mind
To be the boss only thoughts gripping chrome nines
Niggaz get tossed up war scars battle field memories
Swore saw the Devil in my empty glass of Hennessy
Talking to a nigga on a tight leash
Screaming fuck the police as I ride through the night streets
Little child running wild towards his danger
What's the cause don't be alarmed death to all strangers
Maybe I'm a mad man a pistol grabbing nigga
Unleash the sand man
Promise a merciless retaliation nothing is colder
Close your eyes hear the Ballad of a Dead Soulja

(Thug for Life I will lead)
Its just the Ballad of a Dead Soulja
(A Life of Crime I will lead)
Close your eyes, hear the Ballad of a Dead Soulja
(If you play the game you play to win)
This just the Ballad of a Dead Soulja
(It's a crazy world full of sin)
Close your eyes

Completely lost revenge at all costs
Payback's a bitch switch now the tricks crossed
Tossed up and never to be heard of
A single witness screaming bloody murder, murder
Blast tell me homey what ya see now
A blind man and a dead body I'm meant to leave town
And get my cash though hook up wit Kastro
Homey had to blast on the task force
Stupid coppers try to play us out 'member that
They took my money and my stash time to get it them back
Haha I pull my secret arrival
2Pac four fives (.45) time for survival
Death to my rivals tell me what you want lord?
Nobody laugh after the death of a drug lord
Haha the situation's critical nothing is colder
Than hearing the Ballad of a Dead Soulja


Be a coward put your hands to the moon
When my glocks rang out them niggas came out BOOM
Who wanna see me in a challenge
So merciless I'm terrifying niggas in my ballad do you feel me?
Capo or capitan one day I'll be the Don
Until then I remain strong
My only fear of death is reincarnation
Busting at my adversaries like a mental patient
To all my niggas facing sixty years
Shedding tattoo tears another suicidal on the tier
Take a private plane trying to survive the game
For all my homies that'll never be alive again
All they promised us is death nigga
Take a breath could be the last one left nigga
Its real now, uh feel it and fantasize ain't nothing colder
Listen you can hear it, the Ballad of a Dead Soulja


This go out to Kato 'n' Mental
(This is the Ballad of a Dead Soulja)
All the niggaz that have passed away
(Close your eyes, Ballad of a Dead Soulja)
Mutulu, Geronimo, Seyku
All the down ass ridahz
All the niggaz that put it down
All the souljaz
All the niggaz that go through that day to day struggle
(This is the ballad of the dead soulja)
All the niggaz that passed on
All the niggaz with ambition and money in their heart
All the niggaz want some and that don't take none, hahaha
(This is the ballad of the dead soulja)
The police is so scared of us
All the feds, they aware of us
They wanna see us dead,
They got pictures of a nigga hit
(Ballad of the dead soulja)
Try and see me in chains
Shit, them niggaz will never breath again
Before they put me in a cell they'll see me in hell
('Cause this Ballad of the dead soulja)
Got my pistols cocked
Run the whole mutha fucken block
Fuck the cops
The police? We run these streets nigga
(And this Ballad of the dead soulja)
Heh, these niggaz can't see me
Half the world wanna be me
Multi-millionare
Shit, it ain't fair
But nigga-you know
It's the ballad of a dead soulja
Oh, who hoo hoo
Live from the crazy house
You heard that shit nigga
Live from the crazy house
Yo that nigga be crazy as hell

(Hey yo, what you doing with that big ass nigga anyway ?)
My ghetto love song
(Set it off, set it off)
Lets be friends

Mixed together:
(Where my niggaz at, where my niggaz, where my niggaz,
Where my niggaz, where my niggaz at)
(Where my real niggaz at, all my real niggaz,
Throw you mother fucking hands up)
(C'mon, lets go, lets go, lets go, lets see you throw you hands
In the air, throw em, throw em, throw em)
(West side in this mother fucker right here, west side)
(Throw you hands in the air,
Let me see you just throw you hands in the air)

Approach you and posed a minute
All on my double R tinted
As you pass bye
Winkin' my eye
Freshly scented
What's the haps baby, look
Get with me and perhaps lady
You can help me multiply my stacks baby
Currency seems small I need companionship
Do with that scandalous shit
I bet your man ain't shit
So why you hesitating, actin' like your shit don't stink
Check out my diamonds
Bitch everyone gon' blink
This be a thug thing, outlaw
Nigga with riches cream dreamin' mutha fucka
On a mash for bitches
Check my resume, sippin' on crystal and alizee
Smoking on big weed, key'd the Cali way
Don't like trickin' but I'll buy you a fit
I can't stand no sneaker wearing, nappy haired bitch
Let my pedigree read briefly
Their so cheap
Puttin' bitch made bustas to sleep with no grief
Mash on my so called car
Who the man while I'm thuggin' on your main bitch hand
(West side)
Understand this, ain't no nigga like me
Fuck Jay-Z
He broke and I smoke dearly
(C'mon y'all)
Baby lets be friends

Lets be friends
(Where my niggaz at c'mon)
You ain't gotta by my man at all
As long as you just give me your friends
(All my niggaz c'mon)
While you trickin' on them other hoes
Lets be friends
(Where the bitches that want a nigga with money, where you at baby?)
Lets be friends
You ain't gotta by my man at all
As long as you just give me your friends
(Cash making hoe's)
While you trickin' on them other hoes
Lets be ...

I met you and I stuttered in passion
Though slightly blinded
But at last, it was hard to keep my dick in my pants
Every time you pass, got me checking for you hardcore
Staring and watching
Me and you
One on one, picture countless options
Was it prophecy, clear as day?
Visions on top of me
Erotic, psychotic, would possess my body
Far from a crush
I wanna bust your guts
And touch everything inside you, from my head to my nuts
You got my sweatin' like a fat girl going for mine
Just a skinny nigga fuckin' like she stole my mind
Back in time, I recall how she used to be
I guess
Money and fame made ya used to me
What's up in 96?
Lying tricks in drag
Fuck Dre
Tell that bitch he can kiss my ass
Back to you
My pretty ass, caramal queen
Got my hands on your thighs
Now let me in between
As friends

Lets be friends
(West side in this mother fucker right here)
You ain't gotta by my man at all
As long as you just give me your friends
(West side in this mother fucker)
While you trickin' on them other hoes
Lets be friends
(West side in this mother fucker right here)
Lets be friends
You ain't gotta by my man at all
As long as you just give me your friends
(In this mother fucker right here)
While you trickin' on them other hoes

Can you image in me in player mode?
Rush the tricks
I got em, ready for a booty call
I fucked your bitch
Was it me or the fame?
My dick or the game?
Bet I screamed west side when I came
(Westsiiiide!)
Scream my name
Cause baby it's delicious
Got a weak spot for pretty bitches
Up and down, similar to switches
My movement, baby let your back dip into it
Make it fluent
In and out, all around when a nigga do it
You got me high, let me come inside
Love it when you get on top, baby let me ride
Who wanna stop me?
In my top notch
Fucking player hating niggaz 'cause they cock block
You probably hate to see a real thug envisioned with the game
Rather see a nigga up in prison, why you change?
Made a living out of cuss words, liquor and weed
A bad seed turned good, in this world of g's
Baby got me fantasizing of seeing you naked
It's a fuck song, so check my record
And lets be friends

Where my niggaz at?
Show me where my niggaz at
Where my bitches at?
Thugstyle

Lets be friends
Where my niggaz at?
Where my bitches at?

Fucking Lil' Homies
Everybody Ducking
My fucking Lil' Homies
Lil' Homies
Everybody Ducking

Just pay attention, here's a story bout my lil' homey
Str8 thuggin', lil bad young mother fucka, you gotta love him
You can catch him in his G-Ride clutching his glock
Screaming outlaw, (west side) mashing on my enemies block
Educated on these cold streets
Getting money, making dummies out the police
Ain't no peace for an adolescent nigga to wild to be a thinker
Bud smoking 24-7, everyday drinking
I got my diploma but I never learned shit in school
Mo money, mo bitches, mo murder fool
Always the young niggaz getting in shit
She wouldn't stop to conversate so you called her a bitch
Bustin' on paper thin mother fuckas
Drinkin' gin before you get to sinnin' on them bustas
Emptied his clip, passed by like he didn't know me
Everybody duckin'
My fucking lil' homies

Lil' homies on the ride
(Yeah nigga)
Niggaz gonna die tonight
Let's get, high tonight
(My lil' homies)
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from all these punk police
Cause lil' niggaz run the streets

Lil' homies on the ride
Niggaz gonna die tonight (Die tonight)
Let's get, high tonight (High tonight)
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from all these punk police
Cause lil' niggaz run the streets

I remember, when we was just a little G
Flirting with death, playing Russian Roulette
Screaming Kill Me!
Hey there young nigga what you smoking on
Mad at the world cause you came from a broken home
Let us sob cause your mom's is sick
A bunch of adolescent young niggaz spittin' major shit
Tell me, young nigga if you died let me know
Would your heart feel pain, watching as your mother cry?
Would all your homies ride?
Or would they all get high, and talk about how you died?
Young niggaz on a mission to complete
Getting g's, packin' heat, bringin' havoc to the fuckin' streets
Nobody knows why he took a 4-4 and unloaded on the whole front row
Buck! buck!
Try to tell him but he act like he don't know me
Pull out his pistol and show
My lil homies

Chorus + Background talking

First to bomb, 16 on death row
Busting on them phony mother fuckas cause the big homey said so
Niggaz knew, I was a nutcase quick to blast
Living under age but he'll blaze on your bitch ass
Is there a heaven for a G?
And if there is, will I finally get to be at peace?
On these streetz ain't no peace
Shell shocked shows making money off of crack sales
Young black male
Unable to change, 'cause it's a cycle
Plus nobody knows, the evil that they might do
Lil' Moo, Big Yak, K-Kastro
Big Malc, Hussein call them Outlawz
Telling the world to be equipped, when these young mother fuckas rip shit
They don't quit, shoot down on me
Pull a pound on me
Bust like they didn't know me
My fucking lil' homies

Lil' homies on the ride
(What's up nigga?)
Niggaz gonna die tonight
Let's get, high tonight
(My lil' homies)
Lil' homies on the mash

(Verse 2 - SKG)
Daddy rock a playa body till I tell you to stop
Hit the right spot, if not, leave some money and kick rocks
I'm a thug hoe, I need a thug nigga up inside me
A playa that can ride me, a cat that can buy me
Make a jazzy hoe like me, bust a sweat
Hit it from the back, grab me by my neck
Demand your respect

Bustin', twisting nuts (censored), hit 'em up
I'm a Sagittarius freak
My real hoes feel me
Legs open wide, nigga dick inside
I barely ride tonight's the night for you to hit it doggy style
Lay me on my stomach while I'm counting out hundreds
Fake bitches front like they don't wanna keep it real
But you know you want a thug nigga just to see how it feel
Hoes wanna rock Gabbana, Dolce and Versace

(Verse 3 - Tupac)
See, it all started simple
Turning me licking your nipples
Fucking you doggy style to this instrumental
Hands up
All up inside your head
I could stand you
Eyes open
I don't plan to bust, just hold on
Baby let me zone in
What do you mean, can you scream, let it go, biatch
How does it feel?
Gotta nigga like steel in ya
To keep going on, fucking like I'm killing ya
Lets go another round
Baby is you down really
Two shots of esctasy
Lick a nigga down silly
Your body next to me
I can touch you inside, and you'll cry
So good when a nigga leave, you'll die
My mama told baby be a man put it on a hit
On bitches like switches coming around the corner
I wanna let me get my ride on
It's your dick baby but it's my song
If you really want it

Rock ya, body body
Rock ya, body
Rock ya, body body
If you really want it
If you really want it

(Tupac talking)
Gotta send this out to all the freaky bitches
Definitely all the Scorpio's and the Gemini's, and the Virgo's
You know I know the truth about you Scorpio's and you Virgo's
No doubt gotta give it to the Capricorns
They some freaks too on the down down
The Libra's, they like it even but they still like fucking.
No doubt.
Aquarius's, Libra's, that said though
Leos, they some freaks
Leos is freaks, they always wanna run shit in bed
Sagittarius, Taurus, Cancers
All you freaky fucks
I'm a Zodiac fucker I do you all one at a time and all down the line
Let's get busy
(Verse 1 - Tupac)
I was so money orientated initiated as a thug
Fiending for wicked adventures ambitious as I was
Picture a nigga on the verge of living insane
I sold my soul for a chance to kick it and bang
Now tell me if I'm wrong, but saying fuck the world got ya deeper in my songs
Drinking till I hurl, spending money till it's gone, it's the good life
Baby niggaz got it going on
No maybe if I died and came back, wouldn't have to slang crack
Addicted the game, so obviously we came strapped
Please forgive me for my wicked ways
Fuck a bitch
Bad boys eat a dick a day bumping this
Lord have mercy it's a slaughter
So wicked that my tracks is wetting niggaz like it's water
I learned my lessons as a thug in these wicked as hood fights
But I'm a baller now
Nigga
I live the good life

This is the good life
Fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggaz
That trust the hoes
I found a way to stack money
Guaranteed to rise
I live the good good life
Cause thug niggaz don't die

(Verse 2 - Big Syke)
No one knows, what the future holds, for you, huh huh
Listen closely
They say reach in your heart and you will find your mind
Everyday in these streets, got my foresight blind
My after time is now, peeping down the barrel of a fo'
Just a nigga or a killer I don't know, so
Who makes the call?
Will I fall a victim like the rest?
Slug in the chest, one in the dome and make sure I'm gone
Send me home all alone in these cold streets
The desperation, constantly drinking and I can't sleep
Make deep tryin' to survive, some wanna die I wanna stay alive
Eyes on the prize let me modify this whole region
I declare this sucka ducking season
Ya need a reason, why she turned into a softy
After living so loftly
It cost me my soul out of control in the Devil's world
Me, and my niggaz and my girl
Living the good life


(Verse 3 - EDI)
I spend my days and nights, not knowing if strays in flight
Will finally catch me
It's the good life can ya hear me
Cleary, over the edge, soon as I wake up
Last night we off the hook doing way too much
But it's the fast lane on that, big dealing, big sinnin', all for the money
Some kill, some squeal, all for the money
Most ain't even real but we still call them homies
Now what the fuck is that fake love, fake thugs all in the game
I watch 'em all plot and fall, while I come up again
Outlaw never surrender is the call when the day is comin'
But this nigga get to running for my click get to gunnin
Str8 in the mist of all this stress and pain
We're trying to get a hold of the game
Living that good life
To my unborn child
To my unborn, child
In case I don't make it
Just remember daddy loves you
I did everything I could to make things good for you
So don't worry about it
To my unborn
You know daddy loves you

Now ever since my birth, I been cursed since I was born to wile
In case I never get to holler at my unborn child
Many things learned in prison
Blessed to be still living
Trying to earn every penny that I'm gettin'
Reminiscin' to the beginning of my mission
When I was conceived and became to be in this position
My mama was a panther, loud
Single parent but she growled
When she witnessed baby boy ripping wild
I went to school but I dropped out
And left the house cause my momma says I'm good for nothing
So I'm out, since I only got one life to live
God forgive me for my sins
Let me make it and I'll never steal again
Or deal again
My only friend is my misery
Wanting revenge for the agony they did to me
See my life ain't promised but it sure get better
Hope you understand my love letter
To my unborn child

I'm writing you a letter
(To my unborn)
This is for my unborn child
(To my unborn child)
Wanna let you know I love you
Love you
Wanna let you know I feel this way
(To my unborn)
I think about you every day
(To my unborn child)
I have so much to say

So complicated to escape fate
And you can never understand till we trade places
Tell the world I been guilty to being anxious
Ain't no way in hell, that I could ever be a rapist
It's time to face this, cold world on a good day
When will they let the little kids in the hood play?
I got shot 5 times but I'm still breathing
Living proof there's a God if you need a reason
God believe in my own fate
Will I raise my kids in the right or the wrong way
Dear mama I'm a man now
I wanna make it on my own not a hand out
Make way for a whirlwind prophesized
I wanna go in peace
When I gotta die
On these cold streets
Ain't no love, no mercy and no friends
In case you never see my face again
To my unborn child

I'm writing you a letter
(To my unborn)
This is for my unborn child
(To my unborn child)
Wanna let you know I love you
Love you
Wanna let you know I feel this way
(To my unborn)
I think about you every day
(To my unborn child)
I have so much to say

Dear Lord can you hear me?
Tell me what to say to my unborn seed
In case I pass away will my child get to feel loved
Or are we all just cursed to be street thugs
Cause being black hurts
And even worse if you speak first
Live my life as an outlaw
What could be worse
Cause maybe if I tried to change
Who am I kidding?
I'm a thug till I die
I'm a ride
Maintain, touch base
Eat lunch
In plush places
Regular criminal oasis awaits us
If there's a heaven for true thugs
I'll see you there
And I'm sorry for not being there
Just know, your daddy was a souljah
Me against the world
Bless the boys and all my little girls
To the Lord I'm eternal
Resting in peace
Please take care of all my seeds
And my unborn child

I'm writing you a letter
(To my unborn)
This is for my unborn child
(To my unborn child)
Wanna let you know I love you
Love you
Wanna let you know I feel this way
(To my unborn)
I think about you every day
(To my unborn child)
I have so much to say

Please take care of all my kids
And my unborn child
To my unborn child
This letter goes out to my seeds that I might not get to see
Cause of this lifestyle
Just know your daddy loved you
Got nothing but love for you
And all I wanted was for you to have a better life than I
'Cause I was out there on a 24 hour 365 grind
When you get to be my age you'll understand
Just know I got love for you
And I'll see you if there's a ghetto in heaven
If there's a ghetto heaven I'll be there waiting for you
Take care
Run wild, but be smart
Follow the rules of the game
I know sometimes there's confusion
Rules of the game is gonna get you through it, all day every day
Watch out for these snakes and fakes
Snakes come a dime a dozen
Work hard
Study
Get your mind right
Who be the last mother fucker breathin
Tell me nigga
Tell Me
Who be the last mother fucker breathin

Stressed
I'm busta free
Enemies give me reason, to be the last mother fucker breathin
Bustin'
My automatic rounds catch 'em while they sleepin'
Now I'm the last mother fucker breathin

(Tupac)
Woke up with 50 enemies plottin my death
All 50 seeing visions of me shot in the chest
Couldn't rest na nigga I was stressed
Had me creeping round corners
Homies, sleeping in my vest
Shit, I'm like a hostage on this troubled block
Call the cops, a thug nigga screaming west side busting double glocks
Hittin' corners in my Chevy Suburban
Liquor got my driving up on the curb
Hand on the steering wheel swerving
Bless me father I'm a sinner
I'm living in hell, just let me live on these streets
Cause ain't no peace for me in jail
Getting world wide exposure
With a bunch of niggaz that don't give a fuck, riding as my souljahs
I'm just released, I'm on a war path,
Not your average dealer
West side, outlaw, bad boy killer
Complete my mission my competition no longer beefin'
I murdered all them bustas
Now I'm the last mother fucker breathin'


(Young Noble)
Make sure I hold my position, stand firm in the dirt
For all my souljahs gone, we burnin' the earth
Outlawz world-wide, we pack the block
Shoot rocks at the kidups, bust back for Pac
Ask Yak, he'll tell you that it's hell down here, stale down here
To many jails down here
Why you act like you don't hear me
Young Noble
Outlaw till these mother fuckers kill me
I'm still breathin'

(Napoleon)
We was raised, fuck this life
I rose my right
Holding on a tight grip with death in my sight
And the dark is my light, I'm sinner too
Sleepwalking is it true?
Walkin' round town with a pound full of bitter food,
Came a long way from my born day
Dead away, with this war play
Fuck friends, I'll say
Rather die for my AK
With these fag ass niggaz
See through glass ass niggaz
Only ride my dick and scared of my mash ass niggaz
Breathin'


(Kastro)
I walk around, with a knife in my back
Talk about a bad day I live a life like that
It's severe
And I'm losing my hair
Bless a hooligan
Catch me, I'm falling out flat
Yo I'm ruining
Breathin in sewer stench
No one give a fuck about me
I learned to like it like that
When I was still in mommy
Beside a seed that the Devil run from
In the belly of the beast, that's where the fuck we come from
And still we breathin'

(EDI)
Totally wasted, they want me to face this
Just lost two of my closest, man if one of y'all can take this
But I'm Makaveli trained, simple and plain
We number one mother fucker, bout to do it again
Shit, Pac still doin' it
You hoes can't ruin it
Two million every time we drop
I know you fuckers losing it
We moving in, for the kill
For a mil', holding steel
Hold the wheel
I'm bout to give these niggaz something they can feel
(Buck, Buck, Buck, Buck)
Fakin' real
But we the raw and uncut
Style biting
Thug Line niggaz
Give it Up
We Hit Em Up

And we still real
And we still real
Lets turn this house into a happy home
This is for all the homeboys that couldn't get their happy home
Lets turn this house into a happy home

As long one of us got it some of us got it
Lets turn this house into a happy home
You know how that is, stay down for me boo
Hold on

Now we been kicking it for quite some time
Remain beside me through these trials and this life of crime
We done fought so many times I forgot to count
I never hit you, not a coward rather leave your house
Remember back in December when we was tight
Sippin alize and crystal while in every night
In my bedroom, promise that I'll commit to you sometime
Kiss me every time you see me step inside a room
Promise to be good to each other
Plus I love ya so I know your gonna make a good mother
Just try to understand if I change in time
It's only 'cause I never owned anything that's mine
So I'm trying
You can stay with my mama but keep the drama to a low
Never call the police, I never call you bitch or hoe
We were all born hungry in this world alone
Finally moved out my mom's house
And got a happy home

Happy Home
Lets turn the house into a happy home
Happy Home
Finally made it outta moms house, and got a happy home
Happy Home
Turn this house into a happy home
Happy Home


Going through these hard times
Ghetto child of mine
I wonder if you have to suffer for your fathers crimes
To be honest it's a hard road
Just keep your faith in God knowing you'll get scarred though
Look at him walking and talking, a little child with my eyes and mouth
Father watch over little seeds help me guide them out
Had to change my whole lifestyle
Married my baby's mama made her my wife now
I'm trying hard y'all
Maybe in time, I'll be a better man
Watchin the older couples, handle it like veterans
Show me the meaning of together and forever we rise
If it would help our child grow then together we die
Why, question my love? It's so easy to see
Without my family all I'm left with is a shadow of me
After all the arguments and the nights alone
Now it's time to live the good life
Inside this happy home

Happy Home
Turn this house into a happy home
Happy Home
Finally got to live the good life, inside this happy home
Happy Home
Turn this house into a happy home
Happy Home

Happy Home

(Tupac talking)
All these problems got me gone
We got a family of our own
I just want a happy home
Turn this house into a happy home
No man's made to stand alone
I promise I won't do you wrong
I just want a happy home
Finally made it outta moms house, and got a happy home

Happy Home
Turn this house into a happy home
Happy Home
Finally got to live the good life, inside this happy home
Happy Home
Turn this house into a happy home
Happy Home

Hey
Turn this house into a happy home
As long one of us got it some of us got it
Turn this house into a happy home
We going all out, aight, we going all out, aight, we going all out
Watch your mother fucking mouths niggas

That's right
Fuck these fed Niggas Pac
Do it, Do it, Do it.

(Tupac)
Come hell or high water
Down to slaughter opposes
Just another lost soul stuck callin Jehova
Outlaw till it's over
Brandish my strap, back like a cobra
I stay drunk 'cause I'ma mad man
We're never sober
On a one man mission
My ambitions to hold up the rap game
While I plug holes in niggas like doughnuts
And still
Down to die for all my souljahs, like hillbillies
They don't feel me
So we fued
Bringin' war to the city
With each breath
Death before dishonor
Never let you swallow me
No apologies, your honor
A general in war I'm the first to bomb
With a squad of trusted killers quick to move shit, heavily armed
I'm similar to Saddam
Sometimes I question Hussein
Like fiends fighting for that last vein, stuck in the game
I hit the scene like sand storms
Then transform
Watch me, I take a figga of thirty niggaz, who all got me
While bitches wondering, who shot me, no love
Keep a grudge, shooting slugs like Muammar Qadaafi
Murdered my friend built a new posse
We takin' shots at paparazzi
Gon fly now
Nigga like Rocky
You got a lot of nerve to play me
Another gay rapper
Bustin' caps at Jay-Z
(Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck, buck)
And still avoid capture
While you all caught up in the rapture
Still after me I'm in Jamaica sippin' daiquiris
No doubt
We used to havin' nothing
Then grabbin something and bustin'
Wanted to be the thug nigga
That my old man wasn't
I came to a fear catchin' cases, litigation
Niggaz playa hatin'
Got me crooked in all 50 states
I'm screaming Death Row
Throwing Westside
Ain't no thang
We was raised off drive-by's
Brought up to bang
We claim mob
M-O-B., if you be specific
We control all cash from Atlantic-Pacific
And get this
I'm hard to kill
When I bill with this live spot
Father
How the hell did I survive, these 5 shots?
Live it up or give it up and like demons
Late night, hear 'em screaming
We going All Out

We going All Out
Bomb first till they fall out
Take them the war route
Without a doubt
War, which means, we all ride if it's on
Each nigga handle ya own, bring it on strong
If you got bills to pay
Nigga go all out
Busta's playing with your papes
Better go all out
Trying to see the next day
Nigga go all out
Obstacles in your way
Better go all out

(Napoleon)
I'm on my land sled
Walking through the belly of the beast
Feeling like I'm all out, drunk as can be
It's plain to see, who are mob niggas hiding in bushes
Claiming that they ride but they softer than cushion
They softer than bitches in worst way drowning in blood
Outlawz my blood brothers I'd die for these thugs
Say hi to these slugs
It's a shame how some niggas on the west coast
Who was riding with Pac
But when he died they went pop
I mob the Jers' to the fullest lots of west coast love
But after Pac stopped rapping ain't no west coast thugs
Just west coast what?
To my real niggaz stuck in these street game
These rappers like Jay-Z
Who be pumping Kool-Aid through their veins
It's true what I'm saying
Slap your soft ass to the floor
And watch my 4-4 put three holes in your dome
I Ride or Die
While these other fag niggas be biting this
It's all from my heart when I was writing this
Now it's All Out


(Kastro)
We all ride
And down to die
Who with us?
Speak up
Or get treated like you coming to kill us
They nothing but squealers
In this rap game swearing they rough
Tattoo'd up
And now them nigga swearing they Pac
Stop that and watch your back
We ain't forgot about cha
These glocks hot
And when shot would bring the bitch up out cha
It's me, Kastro
With the goatee
Walking like an OG
Cause all these fag mother fuckas owe me
I pray to thug lords, like the mother fuckers holy
Frontline soldier, till the heavens, hold me
I go all out
And if you real you real
Feel what I'm talking 'bout cause this game is real
I live it
Forbidden fruit and shoot till they feel it
Living proof Pac breed niggaz they can't deal with
Holler back, right back, and watch your mouth
Or get blood in it
What, we going all out nigga


Fool, you better go all out
Keep going all out
All my niggaz going all out
Without a mother fucking doubt

Ey, you niggaz just gone think you gon be a, talking slick on all these mother fucking records
And we ain't gonna say shit, now it's 99, this is a different grind, (Don't disrespect the Don)
It's still war mother fuckers
So lets see you act like you know
Ha ha, niggas
Fucking with the wrong nigga

My seductive introduction
Be specific, still elusive
But exclusives what I give you when I kick it
And I'm still lifted
Niggas can't get with Mr.Wicked
Picture me flipping
My adversaries getting the dick swiftly
Niggas is swinging wild but they styles miss me
You can bring that bitch with your whole click
And still get treated shitty
Business never personal, I'm up before the sun come up
I'm tired
Just a ghetto star
A drop-top double R is what I'm riding
Nigga if you was half the man your bitch was
Bring your artillery
When you come for me 'cause we sick thugs
No hesitation when I pull and blast
'Cause Syke was busting
Plus Bo had 'em ducking screaming get they cash
So...
So now I got the law on me
My phones tapped, so I had to send word through my little homies
Tell them niggas just be here when they pull the trigger
Shit
This is what you get, for fucking with the wrong nigga

This is what you get when your
Fucking with the wrong nigga
Ha ha, yeah nigga
Peep

Before I lay me down to sleep, I pray
And thank the lord for giving me another fruitful day
I wanna be a peaceful man, but still
When niggas come for me, all I can see is getting 'em killed
For real, it's how I feel
Perfect my thoughts flowing on these reels
Make my enemies deal with my steel, they caps peel
We still cool, but you played yourself
Give 'em the mack and make 'em spray yourself
Hey
Falling legends, clutching chrome 3-5-7
Putting two bullets to they dome
Wanted to die in heaven
While calling shots nobody real as clear it's me
Ain't trying to help the feds get a case for conspiracy
Murder my foes, get disposed of
We all homies till the death
So my true niggas show me love
God forgive me for my lifestyle
A negative figure
But why they fucking with the wrong nigga?

You know, it's like ...
Why you fucking with the wrong nigga?

I was raised by thugs
Schooled by killers
Learned my mathematic skills from real drug dealers
Tried to rise but they tried me
I guess they all had to die 'cause we tried peace
I die on these streets
Blast till they recognize
Still do or die
All my niggas getting high watching time fly
Best strategize on a way to profit
Best organize how you ride so they can't stop it
Then keep it popping a lot of busters wanna see me fall
I fucked your bitch and now this new shit gon' fade 'em all
My niggas ball, made a call for some backup
The little homies and my dogs in a black truck
Buck Buck was the sound
As they gats burst
No need for ambulance
Baby bring the black hearse
Shoulda never fucked around buster
How you figure making moves on the wrong nigga?
This what it sounds like
Bing, Bing, Bing
When you fucking with the wrong nigga
Niggas getting hit when they fucking with the wrong nigga
Fucking with the wrong nigga
(2Pac)
Ay come on JoJo ('Pac... hahaha)
Yeah that type of shit (maybe it's the thug in me)
You know what time it is (maybe it's the thug in me)

(2Pac)
By age thirteen I was buckwild, good at my knuckle game
Made it through a tough childhood never be the same
Walked in my daddy's shoes
No time to be a peaceful man had to shatter fools
That's till I put my eyes on you
God damn, sweetheart you got some thighs on you
Now I can't wait to get you home, get you all alone
In my bedroom, baby can we bone, and get it on
Tell me lady how you like me
And if you want it harder baby, come and bite me
But do it lightly; cause that excites me when the lady bite
And if you lick me right, I'll do it all night
Only got fucked by a drug dealer
Never felt the real passion of a thug nigga (haha)
Though I like the way you scream when you lovin' me
I'm goin' deep, it's the thug in me; so whatchu sayin' girl?

(Chorus: K-Ci and JoJo) *
A thug nigga like me, I need a thug lady like you
I got a lot of thug in me, that I wanna put in you
A thug nigga like me, I need a thug lady like you
I got a lot of thug in me, that I wanna give to you girl

* 'Pac repeats "Maybe it's the thug in me" at various points

(2Pac)
Moan baby when we bone it's on
It's so strong niggaz in the next room'll cum
I got ya head swingin', tongue kissin' as I hit it from the back
With the bed ringin' (haha)
Give me space as I lick ya face, stick the place
Synchronize so I grind when they kick the bass
Love fuckin' in tha mo'nin
I get ya wet and bust a sweat, then I'm gone
Left you on yo' own girl
Tell me what you feel like, blindfolded
I'm cold do it real nice - that's if it feel right
Maybe it's the thug in me
I pull ya hair while we fuckin' in the chair, when ya lovin' me
Up against the wall, you can have it all; just try
Bet my kiss, can get you high, don't pass by
Grab me by my nuts when I'm lovin' you
Now open up and let me put the thug in you


(2Pac)
Say baby what's your phone number?
Be warned, I'm like a storm with my own thunder, I make the room rumble
In and out long stroke, hold ya breath now
Close your eyes deep though - did you like it?
Ooh I'm excited!
'Cause it's a party in my bedroom, you're invited - c'mon now
Let me see ya shake your rump, tell me
How long will it take to cum, havin' fun
Do it one on one and we can all get involved
First y'all do me, then I'll fuck y'all
When you call me the next day
To get sexed by a nigga in the best way
Yeah baby it's a price to pay, only play in the fast lane
When you a hustler, motherfuck a cash gain
I gotcha goin' wild, 'cause I'm lovin' you
Drugged out with this motherfuckin thug in you


(2Pac)
I don't wanna be talkin', I don't want no explanations
I don't got no motherfuckin expectations, y'knahmsayin?
It's the thug in me
Don't be askin why I'm pullin your hair
And why I fuck so motherfuckin thuggish
That thug passion, y'knahmean?
Bitch, no mercy
What you scared of? Didn't you come over here to get fucked?
You ain't come over here for me to be
Strokin, and all that bullshit
You came over here to get fucked
Shit, if I ain't fuck you thug style
Bitch you'd leave my house talkin' bout, "Tupac can't serve me"
Won't have me crossed up in that bullshit, hahaha
Turn over! Maybe it's the thug in me! ...
Imagine if we could go back
Actually talk to the motherfuckers that persevered (hehehe)
I mean the first motherfuckers that came in the slave ships
(Hey, excuse me, excuse me) Y'know? (Look)

(2Pac)
We back for everything you owe, no longer oppressed
Cause now we overthrow those that placed us in this rotten mess
But let's agree on strategy and pick out enemies right
Who stands accused of the abuse my own, kind do right
Pardon, not disregardin what you thinkin' but you musta been the ship
Cause once I rip your whole shit is sinkin
Supreme ideology, you claim to hold
Claimin that we all drug dealers with empty souls
That used to tempt me to roll, commit to violence
In the midst of an act of war, witnesses left silent
Shatter, black talon style, thoughts I throw
It remains in your brain then of course it grows
Maybe, even your babies can produce and rise
Picture a life where black babies can survive past five
But we must have hope, quotin the reverand from the pulpit
Refuse to turn the other cheek we must defeat the evil culprit
Lace me with words of destruction and I'll explode
But supply me with the will to survive, and watch the world grow
This ain't bout talkin' bout problems, I bring solutions
Where's the restitution, stipulated through the constitution
You violated, now I'm back to haunt your nights
Listen to the screams, of the lives you sacrificed
And in case you don't know, ghetto born black seeds still grow
We comin' back, for everything you owe

(Chorus: sung)
I'm comin' collectin the shit that belong to me
Motherfuckers are runnin' and duckin
I'm a crazy nigga on a mission wit a bad mentality
Armed with missiles guns grenades
Pull out the pin, free I'm comin'

(2Pac over Chorus)
How do you plead Mr. Shakur, how do you plead?
How do I plead?
Yes sir, how do you plead?
Shit, you know how I plead
C'mon!
Psssh

(2Pac)
Not guilty on the grounds of insanity it was them or me
Bustin' at my innocent family, say they lookin' for ki's
I was home alone, blind to the prelude
Bust in, talkin' bout, Where is the quaaludes? What you say fool?
Where in the hell is the search warrant?
No feedback is what he uttered, before he screamed Nigga motherfucker
Dropped me to my knees I proceed to bleed
Sufferin a rain of blows to my hands and knees
Will I survive, is God watchin?
I grab his gat and bust in self - defense, my only option, God damn
Now they got me goin' to the county jail
And my family can't pay this outrageous bail
Try to offer me a deal, they told me if I squeal
Move me, and my people, to a mansion in Brazil
Not me, so this is how it ends, no friends
I'll be stressed and they just, reposessed my Benz
Told the judge it was self - defense, he won't listen
So I'm bumpin this in federal prison, givin' everything I owe
Perhaps I was addicted to tha dark side
Some where inside my childhood witnessed my heart die
And even though we both came from tha same places
Tha money and tha fame made us all change places
Could it be through tha misery
That came to past,
The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask,
For currency,
But you could run to me when you need me,
I'll never leave honestly someone to believe in as you can see.
It's a small thang through and true
What can I do real homies help you get through
And comin' new he'd do tha same thang if he could
'Cause in tha hood true homies make you feel good
And happy times we be actin' up call tha cops
Bringin' tha cease to tha peace that was on my block
It never stop, when my mama ask me will I change
I tell her yeah but it's clear I'll always be tha same
Until the end of time


So take, these Broken Wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again,
(Until The End Of Time)
So I can fly, until the end of time
(Until The End Of Time, Until The End Of Time)

Verse Two

Please Lord forgive me for my life of sin
My hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids
So you know I don't hang around tha house much
This all night money makin' got me outta touch, shit
Ain't flashed a smile in a long while
An unexpected birth worst of tha ghetto childs
My attitude got me walkin' solo
Ride out alone in my low-low
Watchin' tha whole world move in slow mo
For quiet times I disappear and listen to tha ocean
Smokin' pots think my thoughts
Then it's back to coastin'
Who can I trust in this cold world
My phoney homie had a baby by my own girl
But I ain't trippin' I'm a playa
I ain't sweatin' him
I sex his sister had her mumble like like a Mexican
His next of kin
No remorse it was meant to happen
Besides rappin' tha only thing I did good was scrappin'
Until tha end of time


So take, these Broken Wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again,
(Until The End Of Time)
So we can fly, until the end of time

Take these Broken Wings,
You've got to learn to fly, n learn to live so free
(Until The End Of Time)
So we can fly, until the end of time
(Time, Until The End Of Time)

Verse Three:

Now who's to say if I was right or wrong?
To live my life,
As an Outlaw all alone
Remain strong in this planet full of playa hataz
They conversate but Death Row full of demonstrators
And in tha end drinkin' henessey made all my enemies envy me
So cold when I flow eliminatin' easily
Falls to they knees, they plead for their right to breath
While beggin' me to keep tha peace haha
Well I can see close into achieve
In times of danger don't freeze time to be a G
Follow my lead I supply everything you need
An ounce of game and tha trainin' to make a G'
Remember me?
As an Outcast Outlaw
Another album out that's what I'm about - more,
Gettin' raw till tha day I see my casket
Buried as a G' while tha whole world remembers me
Until the end of time

So take, these Broken Wings
(So take, these Broken Wings)
I need your hands to come and heal me once again, (once again, once again)
(Until The End Of Time)
So we can fly, until the end of time

Take these broken wings,
You'v got to learn to learn to fly 'n' learn to live so free
So we can fly, until the end of time

RL:
If the angels come down
And takes me away
Memories of Me and my songs will always stay
Until The End Of Time
(Chorus 2X: 2Pac)
M.O.B., nigga 'cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches

(2Pac)
Thugs known to bust on sight
God bless my crazy life la vida loca homie livin' that thug life
Been raised in violence homicide's my lullaby
Came with the homies and learned to kick it until we die
Boss players you wonder why
I live the life of a ghetto kingpin, just let me ride
Bitches and niggaz in penitentiary suits
I send 'em letters and money orders and make 'em my troops
As for you females, I got no time, I gotta get mine
You cannot blind me addicted to a life of crime
My time as a shorty was full of car chases
While runnin' with John Gotti's and Scarface's
Niggas knew, I'd be the Don of my own crew
A million niggaz with automatics who swarm through
You wonder who shot me here's a clue, stay alert
'Cause we comin' for you, and keep it money over bitches

(Chorus 2X: 2Pac)
Nigga 'cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches
(Keep it money over bitches)
Nigga 'cause we mob on you tricks
M.O.B.
And you know we keep it money over bitches

(Fatal)
I blow you up on the spot, these glocks hot till you drop
All you wannabe cops, you don't wanna see shots
I beef deep with the police, peep what these streets do to me
Actin' all new to me I creep on you like puberty
You don't wanna see the bad image of this scrimmage
From here to East Greenwich through every state with a sentence
Frozen weight in the cooter, ten plates to soup ya
1 2's we oughta cruise right by the state troopers
When I'm drinkin' Crystal, start thinkin' 'bout Al
Bacardi coverin my body at the wink and a smile
Bag a hottie or two, cause butter shotties for you
I got more bodies than Drew, I drink (Minoti Anu?), fuck your crew
This type of shit I do for a petty hobby
Fuck the whole world it's Fatal dog against everybody

(Chorus 2X: 2Pac)
M.O.B., nigga 'cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches

(Mopreme)
My shit's phenomenal, droppin' like domino
Comin' with the real yo and fuck what you feel yo
This is not for all the freaks in short skirts
This is for my niggaz nationwide doin' work, get your feelings hurt
Lose mo' faith than a composure, money and the doja
Bitches is a cobra with deadly venom
Move as smooth as I get 'em, stackin G's
My niggas crosstown got keys
Hoes get diseased and fleas, for these enemies money over bitches
(Nigga!)

(Chorus 2X: 2Pac)
M.O.B., nigga 'cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches

(Big Syke)
I'm hittin sixteen switches, my money over bitches
The struggle continues I'll miss you on my road to riches
I'm contrived to strive never laggin
Disappear in the night with my 64 dragon, rag flaggin
As I get 'em up and leave 'em stuck
Pager blowin' up but I don't give a fuck
I'm fully stocked on the block, pockets full of rocks sellin
Loc'ers and smokers engaged twenty-fo'/seven
So what can you do for me and what can I do for you
But stay true, and do the things that we do
Blinded evil-minded no option for my offspring
Reminded can't find it complications what the future brings
Losin my mind why you sweatin me all the time
I'm caught in a bind, quality time on my grind
Rather be lonely honey and dodge you like snitches
I'm 'bout my riches, money over bitches

(Chorus 2X: 2Pac)
M.O.B., nigga 'cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches

(Kadafi)
That's from the time a nigga close his eyes I'm hopin, I hope he awoken
Payin' my own that's tokin chokin off-a glocks smokin'
Money and power watch these bitches 'cause they skanless
Gettin' niggaz fucked 'n' stuck from Timbuk' to Los Angeles
Ain't a nigga ruggeder than this grimy Heine' guzzler
Cowards better duck before my calibers start rubbin ya
Me and my troops play blocks in groups, runnin' in flocks
Deuce-deuce in my socks keepin' a watch out for cops
Gettin' kicked, I keep my mind on my riches
While uncontrolled schemes keep me choosin' my money over all my bitches

(Chorus 4X: 2Pac)
M.O.B., nigga 'cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches

(2Pac)
That's right nigga
Money over motherfuckin bitches
MOB. on 'em nigga
Keep your motherfuckin mind on your money, fuck these hoes
(Thug life baby) You don't need no motherfuckin bitches
You need some motherfuckin money
Get your mind right nigga, keep your game tight
Play right play by the rules and you'll get paid fuck the fools
We up out of this bitch here

Wild ridahs all I see when I open up

Not sure, of who to trick on but I'm collectin these vicks when I put the dick on her
O-U-T-L-A-W-Z
Fucking with a nigga living destructively, pump and pee Tuckin T's up in?
When I jump on I'm trying to handle my business full grown

(Young Noble)

(Napoleon)
Nigga duck down buck first, make 'em feel somethin'
Shouldn't (?) if you ain't kill nuttin
You didn't kill me now you gotta face a young man got chrome heavily armed
Outlawz did that, heavily gone
So we ride with what's left us, the best of us
Plus we wake up with our tech on us
We test yo' nuts in a heartbeat, sleep on the street
Obey the rules of the ones who want beef we'll eat
Y'all niggaz weak in a motherfuckin way it's so pitiful
I'll leave you mother fuckers critical
We heard the slick shit you said on fucking Too $hort tape
But you only stepped your way into an early wake, early grave
That's what you brave niggaz get for fucking with this
You had your chance to mob first you didn't you missed
Just switched to fake
Napoleon be the mother fucker last nigga with the gat to break
The last of fate, earthquake aftershock, is what you got
Fuckin' with niggaz that give a damn about hip-hop
This how it go in our family
Busting outlawz shit is what we stand for gradually
We world wide mob figgaz

(Tupac Talking)
World wide mother fucking mob figgaz
Weed smoking, Gun toting, drinking
Riding on our mother fucking enemies
Y'all know how we do it
A world wide mob figure

(Young Noble)
I be the Young N-O to the B-L-E
Last name O-U-T-L-A-W-Z
M-A-R was for starters, flee the whole cartridge
Your lady blew out the squad and the whold sausage
(?), Hitting donuts in a six
Sip Coronas when we bendin the corner, brothers hit
Urban legend, dirty third still reppin
Still double-S to bum rush your session
I get as dirty as birt, you just a nigga in a skirt
Drinkin' Squirt, punk duck, hit the dirt
Sprint to the church that you got comin'
Outlawz on the ride picture God runnin'
Ain't nuttin but a thug thang, bust your brains
Pac passed the rock so we tucked the game
Under our belt, we huntin the wealth, you fuckin' yourself off
Don't you know not to go against the Outlawz


World wide mob figga let me see a nigga nuts hang...
World wide mob figga let me see a nigga nuts hang...

(Verse Four: 2Pac)
Hey watch out man, look out
Known for doin' scandalous deeds, no handlin me
And nah it ain't the drugs it's the straight thug nigga in me
I swoop down and cause havoc
My rapid delivery, is automatic lettin niggaz have it
I've been labelled as a thug nigga
Since they don't sell my shit to white folks
Ship it to the drug dealers
And catch a catch a nigga world wide
A fuckin' mob figga West coast, who-ride
When we rob niggaz money make my squad bigger
But we ain't sell our souls

At my shows I'm a nut, lights camera time for action

(Reporter)

Good Evening (sirens in the background)
I'm reporting live from Sunset Boulevard
Where many excited fans have gathered with candles
(Crowd starts chanting "Tupac")
Awaiting the much anticipated release, of Tupac Shakur's latest album, Better Dayz
This is yet another post-humorous release by Tupac
Which, raises the question
Where are these songs coming from?
It's interesting how, the message in these songs
Is still relevant today
Even in his death, he's touching people with his lyrics
I can feel the energy in the air, as they count down to midnight
When the album will officially be released
Oh, hold on, I, think they're starting to countdown now

(Crowd)

5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ...
(Tupac)
Straight muthafuckin' ballin'
Part two-
Still ballin'

Westside...

(Verse 1: Tupac)
Now ever since a nigga was a seed
Only thing promised to me was the penitentiary
Still Ballin'
Ridin' on these niggaz 'cause they lame
In a 6-1 Chevy still heavy in this game
Can you feel me?
Blame it on my mama I'm a thug nigga
Up before the sunrise quicker than the drug dealers
Tell me if it's on
Nigga then we first to bomb
Bust on these bitch made niggaz hit em' up
Westside!...
Ain't nobody love me as a broke nigga
Finger on the trigger lord forgive me if I smoke niggaz
I leave my female strapped
Love fuckin' from the back
I get my currency in stacks
California's where I'm at
Riden...
Pass by
While these niggaz wonder why
I got shot but didn't die
Let em' see who's next to try
Did I cry, hell nah...
Nigga tear shed
For all my homies in the pen many peers dead
Nigga
Still Ballin'

(Chorus: Tupac and Trick Daddy)

(Still ballin')
Until the day I die
(Until I die)
You can bring your crew
(You can bring your crew)
But we remain true
(Yeah)
Muthafuckers still ballin'
(I be ballin')
Niggaz wonder why
(They wonder why)
You can bring your crew
But we remain true
Muthafuckers still ballin'

(Verse 2: Trick Daddy)
Now if you kneel and pray
And hope the lord understands
When he's gone the father become a dangerous man
Ain't crazy or deranged
I'm sane (I'm sane)
But when these kids go to spray him
Boy I won't be playin'
But clienteles
And rhyme sell's
Question is will you fuckin' niggaz ride for real
Bitch nigga this is g rated
Plus your homeboy won't make your street game fool daisy
I'm elevated to the top of this shit
Now fuck around and put me and Tupac on this bitch
And you can tell 'em thug life was the reason for this
And I'll ride for any nigga who believe in this shit
I'm still ballin'

(Chorus: Tupac)

Still Ballin'
Until the day I die
You can bring your crew
But we remain true
Muthafuckers still ballin'
Niggaz wonder why
You can bring your crew
But we remain true
Muthafuckers still ballin'

(Verse 3: Tupac)
Now everybody wanna see us dead
Two murdered on the front page shot to death bullet's to the head
Niggaz holla out my name
And it's similar to rain
Muthafuckers know I'm comin' so they runnin' to they graves
Watch!
Swoop down with my nigga from the pound
'Cause trick don't give a fuck when you coward niggaz down
Blast!
Keep pumpin' they worried bout nuttin'
Bustas thought we was frontin'
So we load and keep dumpin'

(Chorus repeated till the end)

(Trick Daddy)
Thug Life!

(Tupac)
Still ballin'
Muthafuckers still ballin'

Straight muthafuckin' ballin'(faded out...)
2Pac:
Fugees! Fugees and Mobb Deep tryin' to diss now too huh?
Hahaha! Well I ain't prejudiced, I don't give a fuck
This is what it sounds like - when we ride on our enemies
Biatch! When we ride on our enemies

Hey! Got some static for some niggaz on the other side of town
Let my little cousin K roll, he's a rider now
What they want from us motherfuckin thug niggaz?
Used to love niggaz now I plug niggaz, and slug niggaz
Am I wrong? Niggaz makin' songs, tryin' to get with us
Must be gone on stress weed, in the West we trust
To the chest I bust! Then we ride till the sun come
Shinin back to brighten up the sky, many die
Heard the Fugees was tryin' to do me - look bitch!
I cut yo' face, this ain't no motherfuckin movie
Then! We watch the other two die slow
Castrated entertainin at my motherfuckin sideshow
Bam! Set my plan in mo', time to exterminate my foes
I can't stand you hoes, uh
Now label this my fuckin' trick shot
My lyrics runnin' all you cowards out of hip-hop
When we ride - on our enemies

When we ride on our enemies
I bet you motherfuckers die, when we ride, on our enemies
When we ride on our enemies
Make sure everybody dies, when we ride, on our enemies

Eminem:
They think they crazy but they ain't crazy
Lets face it
Shit basically they juss playin' sick
They ain't shit they ain't sayin' shit spray 'em 50
A to the K get in the way
I bring Dre and them wit me
And turn this day into fuckin' mayhem you stayin wit me?
Don't let me lose you
I'm not tryin' to confuse you
When I let loose wit this uzi and just shoot through your isuzu
You get the message?
Am I gettin' through to you?
You know its comin'
You motherfuckers don't even know do you?
Take some Big and some Pac
And you mix them up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top
What the fuck do you got?
You got tha realest and illest killas tied up in a knot
The juggernauts of this rap shit
Like it or not
It's like a fight to the top
Just to see who died for the spot
You put your life in this
Nothin' like survivin the shot
Y'all know what time it is
As soon as 50 signs on this dot
Shit what you know about death threats?
'Cause I get a lot
Shady records was 80 seconds away from the towers
Them cowards fucked wit the wrong building
They meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children
Nuclear showers there's nothin' spookier
Your now about to witness the power

2Pac:
When we ride on our enemies
I bet you motherfuckers die, when we ride, on our enemies
When we ride on our enemies
Bet all you mutherfuckers die, when we ride, on our enemies

Come take a journey through my mind's eye
You crossed the game, don't explain, nigga time to die, say goodbye
Watch my eyes when I pull the trigger
So right before you die you bow before a bigga nigga, now dry yo' eyes
You was heartless on yo' hits
Niggaz love to scream peace after they start some shit - pay attention
Here's a word to those that robbed me
I murder you then I, run a train on Mobb Deep! Don't fuck with me
Nigga you're barely livin', don't you got sickle cell?
See me have a seizure on stage, you ain't feelin' well, hell
How many niggaz wanna be involved?
See I was only talkin' to Biggie, but I'll kill allay'all, then ball
Then tell Da Brat to keep her mouth closed
Fuck around and get tossed up, by the fuckin' Outlawz
Before I leave, make sure everybody heard
Know I meant, every motherfuckin word
When we ride on our enemies

When we ride on our enemies
Make sure everybody die, when we ride, on our enemies
When we ride on our enemies
I make sure everybody die, when we ride, on our enemies
When we ride on our enemies
When we ride on our enemies
When we ride on our enemies
(2Pac Talking)
Shit, I'm a changed man
Hey turn the lights up
Still ballin', 2Pac up in this bitch
You know how we swing this shit
Look:

(Verse 1: 2pac)

By age 16 I sold to dope fiends
Not a drug dealer but I watched them closely
Until they noticed me
I got the feds wondering who broke the law
Fuck too inhibited for gun smoke I broke his jaw
Words harder than a fucking diamond
Mobile phone call to Simon, niggas trippin' homie, when we riding?
Fuck 'em slowly like Jodeci
I'd stick a needle in my eye
If I don't live and die for M.O.B
And fuck your homeboys nigga we can drop the guns
I hit your block and we can box for fun
Nigga one on one
Last to fall is a baller cat
It's Death Row why the fuck you think we call it that?
So if you knew me in my past life
Don't act like we homeboys
Ain't no love in the fast life
I switch gears on them jealous bitches
Who do you fear?
The game plan of a changed man
So what I'm saying is ...

I changed gears but I'm still the same old ridah
(Fucking with a changed man)
I slang a new dope to the world but the people still buy it up
(Nigga you fucking with a changed man)
All my real thug niggas go and get your hands up now, your gonna flip your hands up
(Fucking with a changed man)
Changed man, you dealing with a changed man

(Hey, eh, eh, hey, eh)

In drop top
Glock cocked
Got rocks in ma socks
Cops spot Watt niggas
But hard to stop niggas
Not if the gat niggas
Doughboys and hot niggas
Who might have shot niggas
But only by strolling
Out for respect
Now days they expect me to be in a Ferrari or the old Lexus
But anything you see flashin past and can't tell
That's me
Gauge on the Escalade back seat
Don't creep
But what you think
T.I. be in them suites?
But don't sleep
Get you hit from your head to feet
Hey you don't know me
I'm fittin' to introduce you to the old me
You walk in, explode it and leave reload
You don't like a record nigga - buck you, blow
But you will respect me
Or get it in your neck piece chief
No grief nigga still gonna let me be
Or get your insides exposed to the streets, nigga


I changed plans but I'm still the same old ridah
(Your fucking with a changed man)
Slanging new dope to the world but the people still buy it up
(Nigga you fucking with a changed man)
All my real thug niggas go and get your hands up now, your gonna flip your hands up
(Fucking with a changed man)
Changed man, you dealing with a changed man

(Verse 3: 2Pac)
A niggas so cold when I flow
Bow down to death row
Three wheel motion
Coming through coasting
Who's that nigga in the g-ride
Screaming out m.o.b
Nigga we ride
I hit the charts like a stick up kid
Number one in the nation
I fucked the world
The judge gave me probation
Faced with incarceration
Move tapes like it's big weights
Slanging to the whole nation
Give me mine or I'm blastin';
On every song
Murder my enemies
I'm mashing until I'm gone
One love to my thug niggas
And fuck a bitch cause a truce is to love niggas
Throw your hands in the air close your eyes and hope
You ever come against a mass of smoke
On Death Row
My adversaries bleed
But fuck 'em all till the talk cease
Fucking with a changed man


I changed plans but I'm still the same old ridah
(You fucking with a changed man)
Slanging new dope to the world but the people still buy it up
(Nigga you fucking with a changed man)
All my real thug niggas go and get your hands up now, your gonna flip your hands up
(Fucking with a changed man)
Changed man, you dealing with a changed man

(2Pac Talking) (over chorus)
Haha, everybody think they understand a nigga
Shit you niggas don't know me
Y'all know that nigga on the rap songs
Y'all know that nigga in the movies
You don't know this nigga in 3d
The real live right up against you in front of your face...(shit)
Westside
Outlaw immortals (hahaha)
Nigga you fucking with a changed man (hahaha)
You fucking with a changed man (hahaha)
I ain't the same, you fucking with a changed man
We ain't the same, you fucking with a changed man
We ain't the same, fucking with a changed man
Changed man ...
You a what? Bad Boy Killaz
(That's right bitch, Fuck em' all)
Hahaha yeah nigga, fuck em' all
(That's right bitch, Fuck em' all)
Fuck all you muthafuckers
Ay Yo Biggie Put your hands up

(Verse 1: Tupac)

Now I can make it happen
My rappin' is similar to muthafuckers
When they scrappin'
Blast and watch em' back up
Notorious biggie killer
Affiliation with death row
Niggaz get their caps pealed back
Fool this the west coast
Fuck a misdemeanor I'm raisin hell like felonies
Mr. Makaveli straight outta jail to sellin' these
Intoxicated we duplicated but never faded
Now that we made it my adversaries is player hatin'
Got a Mercedes for these tricks
That thought I quit
Then got a drop top jag for these bitches that's on my dick
Go to a club in a pack
I'm smokin' bud in the back
I wait for niggaz to trip
Cause bitch I love to scrap
Now mama raised me as a thug nigga
With love niggaz
I'm a millionaire started as a drug dealer
I went from rocks to zines
Writing raps and movies
I went from trustin these tricks now they all want to sue me
So Fuck em' all


(That's right bitch, Fuck em' all)
(Young Noble) Come put your hands up in the air, it's a middle finger affair, yeah
(That's right bitch, Fuck em' all)

(Verse 2: Kadafi)

Now could you picture my criminal status at its fuckin' peak
Even the baddest be gettin' murdered in they seats
I'm addicted to these streets
Like crack is to these creeps
Seein' visions of a prison
Wake up screamin' in my sleep
Is there a heaven in this hell
A possibility of livin' well
But if they killin' me
I get my stripes and whose to tell
Choosing to sell
I'd rather die and be deceased
World mob figga addicted to these fucking streets

(Verse 3: Edi)

Now put your muthafucking hands up
If you'se a rider (ride)
Niggaz ain't killers
So they hidin'
Why?
Fuck em' all, touch em' all
That's the way that we do it
Ride up, hop the fuck out watch that bitch nigga lose it
Man I'm as strong as this game
Y'all be knowing my name (Edi)
A young high strung thug nigga
Created by pain
Livin' my life in the fast lane
Gettin' fucked by the past
Got my mind on my cash and my next piece of ass
So fuck em' all

(Young noble) Come put your hands up in the air, It's a middle finger
Affair, yeah

(Young noble) I do my girl all by my lonely, don't need no phony homey to

(That's right bitch, Fuck em' all)
(Young noble) Nigga, we Outlaw ridah'z don't give a fuck if ya love us we
Thuggin'

(Verse 4: Tupac)

I got glad bags with enemies
Cut up so they remember me
Soaked up in Hennessey
So they relatives know it's me
You can bet your last dollar
I'll dick em' and holla
Ridin' these hoochies
Like they some heavy ass Chevy impalas
Jump up and get your ass shot up
For the profit pick my glock up
I'm bustin' in self defense ya see
Poppin' nobody got em'
Holla Outlaw riders
Mash up on the gas pedal
Vacate the scene
Count the cash and stash the precious metal
Here come the coppers
The swat team and the helicopters
Them crackers is crazy
Why? 'Cause they'll never stop us
I watch Arnold Swarchzenegger
Bust some body in the movie
Now I want to do it too
Oh, oh niggaz is too through
True to the game
I claim Outlaw riders
We give a fuck what they try
I'm...

(Verse 5: Young Noble)

Cause Young Noble behind it
Can you picture me stickin' niggaz for they watch and chain
Kick back lil nigga
And watch the game
Get your mobb rocked and what-not
We keep it poppin' like a drug spot
The streets know what's hot
Trust me

(Verse 6: Napoleon)

Even my hood call me baby Malcolm X with the tek's
Shower some slugs on em'
I've got a brother don't rest
And he keep some drugs on him
Always in grind mood
Hustle to find food
Ever seen faces of death
That's what my nine do

(Verse 7: Kastro)

I keep my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
With my back against the wall
Like I'm runnin' outta time
Even rap with a gat
I must be goin' out my mind
Like I'm up against the world
This guerilla team of mine
Screamin'

Thug Life Bitch, Fuck em' all
(That's right bitch, Fuck 'em all)

And die for em'
Even if them the last nigga left I'ma ride for em'
Feel me?
Until they kill me, that's how I'm rollin'
Fuck em' all
Let them die
That's my slogan
Fuck em' all


(That's right bitch, Fuck 'em all)
(Young Noble) Come put your hands up in the air, It's a middle finger affair, yeah
(That's right bitch, Fuck 'em all)
(Young Noble) I do my girl up by my lonely, don't need no phony homey to call me
(That's right bitch, Fuck 'em all)
(Young Noble) Back off I hit at everyone of you homies so don't get comfortable, I'm runnin' you
(That's right bitch, Fuck 'em all)
(Young Noble) Nigga, we Outlaw ridah'z don't give a fuck if ya love us we thuggin'
(That's right bitch, Fuck 'em all) (repeat 2 times to fade)
(Tupac)
Now of course I want peace on the streets
But realisticly
Painting perfect pictures ain't never work
My misery was so deep
Couldn't sleep through all my preasures
My quest for cash
I learned fast
Using violent measures
Memorys of adolescent years
Their was unity
But after puperty we brought war
To our community
So many bodies dropping
Its got to stop
I want to help
But still I'm stepping
Keeping my weapon
Must protect myself
Promise of a better tomorrow
Ain't never reach me
Plus my teachers were to petrfied in class to teach me
Sipping thunderbird
And grape kool-aid
Calling Earl since my stomach was empty
It seduced me to fuck the world
Watch my lil homiez
Lose there childhood to guns
Nobody cries no more
'Cause we all die for fun
So why you ask me if I want peace
If you can't grant it
Niggas fighting across the whole planet
So we can never be peace

Will never be peace
Or all we all just headed for doom
Still consumed by the beefs
And I'll know there never be peace
That's why I keep my
Pistol when I walk the streets
Cause there never be peace

(Marvelouz)
No time to rest
They stressed out
I can't remember the days my homie was here
Now a days we live in fear
The stuggle is still here
So now who's grabbing there strap
Who's getting bucked wild
Representing the generation of killers
When I was a child had many dreams
Reality kept me and my homiez stressing
Tyring to raise my baby girl to be the strongest
Know when I'm doing wrongest
I never had a bright day
Just drunkless smoking blunts
Getting faded
Wishing my partna made it
If it was peace
Or ????????
I know there will never be
All my tears were shed
When I lost my homie number three
It's getting harder to see
Impossibilty should we just face it
Can't get through the pain
But still I can't erase it
So many trials and tribulations
Things we facing
Wicked days
Can't see no brighter days
It's time to chase it
Cross dreams
Cause the scene is when you never get by
That's why I got to stay high
You'll never know when you'll die
My heart will never leave the ghetto
I know to rise only in peace
That's why I say
There ain't never going to be no peace

Will never be peace
Or all we all just headed for doom
Still consumed by the beefs
And I'll know there never be peace
That's why I keep my
Pistol when I walk the streets
Cause there never be peace

(Storm)
Living life lonely
But I can't even cry
Cause visions of diseption
All around me
Got my eyes full of despise
Who can I trust
Why even try
They say the world is mine
But I know that's a lie
Living to die
Set up from birth
Steady dreaming
Wishing for better days
But all I see is demons
Close my eyes
Reminisence of my childhood
All I felt was pain from my arrival
No memories of nothing nice
Nothing but blinded reminders of my future life
I'm freaking out
I'm getting closer to that other level
Will I be strong with game
Or just the heartless devil
I hope I'm able to find peace in me
Cause there's a storm sixty four inches deep in me
And I try to do the right thing
But it's the wrong thing
That seems to bring me right back
To this dirty game
There never be peace
Fuck peace

Will never be peace
Or all we all just headed for doom
Still consumed by the beefs
And I'll know there never be peace
That's why I keep my
Pistol when I walk the streets
Cause there never be peace

(Tupac)
Shit fuck peace, on the strength to my niggas get a peace, we can't
Have
Peace, how the fuck we gonna live happy when we ain't got none, tear
Drops and closed caskets, these mothafuckas are smiling but don't mean
Much, why 'cause I got to be a thug, see drugs gonna turn this
Mothafuckn
Head out, all us niggas acting up, wild ass mothafuckn adolescent,
These
Niggas ain't got a childhood no more, how the fuck can you have a
Childhood when your at the funeral every fuckn weekend, you
Mothafuckas
Are talking about peace, niggas it ain't no mothafuckn peace, you
Ain't
Seen the news mothafucka, you ain't heard, little babies getting
Smoked,
Mothafuckas killing their whole family, little kids getting thrown off
Buildings, mothafuckas getting a
Young mothers
That's right
I feel ya (hey)
I know how it is
(MAMA's JUST A LIL' GIRL)
Don't nobody understand
I feel ya

(Verse 1: Tupac)

She was born a heavy set girl with pig tails and curls
A heart full of gold, still it won't change the world
Though she could never understand why
Some underhanded plans, witnessed a man die
Was only 15, should have been a beauty queen
Still see here crying by the caskets when here parents got killed
Little girl don't cry, 'cause even though they died
You can best believe they watching over thee from the sky
Never asked for this misery but look at what you getting
It's a blessing in disguise, when you find out your pregnant
No money, no home, and even though you all alone
You got to do this on your own, so baby go on
I wish you luck and if you need me, call
Just come to me and let me feed you all
I can understand the way it feels when you fighting the world
Facing all this drama when mama's just A little girl


Mama don't know why
Mama's just a little girl
Given that she is or not
Time ain't on her side
Mama's just a little girl
(Mama's just a little girl)
She gotta hold her head up high

(Verse 2: Tupac)

At 16 what a beautiful thing
The very essence of a jet black ebony queen
And who could tell she would get pregnant at an early age
She didn't listen, had sex watch her belly raise (hey)
Got violated by someone she dated
If this is fate I hate to see the seed she created
So we wait, though it takes time to build the body and the mind
She reclines 9 months then finally its time
What do we find?
A little groaning boy of mine with a tortured soul
Addicted to a life of crime had no time for the growing stage
He learned his values on the streets at an early age
Watch for police don't come home (why)
'Cause mammas acting crazy at the hospital about to have another baby
Like the rose from concrete groaning within
Blessed with twins how the hell can mamma raise 3 men
So we began close as family such insanity
A happy home for one act inhumanity
Plus mamas said the seed was corrupted
Used the rub her belly begging us to breathe if she love us
Now mama sits quiet sipping peppermint schnapps
Turned the house into a spot and made her watch for cops (hey)
How could mama bring a thug like me into this world?
She ain't the cause of all the drama cause mommas just a little girl


Mama
Don't know why
Mama's just a little girl
Liven if she is or not
Time ain't on her side
Cause ama's just a little girl
(Mama's just a little girl)
She gotta hold her head up high
(How could she raise us)

(Verse 3: Tupac)

Now would she remain in the same spot?
The gunshots rang, they came from the cane spot
Now look here I see her clutching her son in her arms she hurt
Her heart bleeding as she watched her seed die in the dirt
Fulfil prophecy but who could stop the grief?
I walk around trying to hold the world up on top of me
Probably be an innocent man but still I'm the victim of a curse
What could be worse? nothing but pain
Since my birth, taught me functions at the pen
Cause everybody's in paying back society I'm guilty of a life of sin
I watched the drama occur my eyes blurred 'fore I jet it
I wonder why we all have to die before we get it
Though we shed tears so many peers I done buried
Worried and scared knowing I'ma see the cemetery
Must be prepared in this cold world no one cares
No it ain't fair but we all there and do our share
In this land of underhanded schemes and plans
Vivid dreams of a nigga having g's in hand
Mamma told me not to be a punk
They ain't a thing I wouldn't do for my mamma in this world
Cause you know I ain't mad at cha you' just a little girl
See mammas just a little girl
(Hey hey)


*Repeat until fade*

Mama
Don't know why

And I ain't facing all this drama...(Cause mamma's just a little girl)
They asked us why we mutilate eachother like we do
And wonder why we hold such little worth on human life (facin all this drama)
To ask us why we turn from bad to worse, is to ignore from which we came
You see you wouldn't ask why the rose that grew from the concrete had damaged petals
On the contrary - we would all celebrate its tenacity, we would all love its will to reach the sun
Well... we are the roses, this is the concrete, and these are my damaged petals
Don't ask me why... Thank God nigga, ask me how (hahahaha)

Heeey
(Mopreme)
It was a dope spot front yard, one on one strapping
That's the way it was way before all the scrapping
Earned my fucking props from the G's in the hood
Put in work, did some dirt, never snitched, never would
Rollin' the fat Jaguars with my nigga P blowing up
Time coming back sipping Hennessey
Seventeen years old and I felt like God mad rich
And I had my pick of any fine bitch
And my family was known to be great, seen slightly more
Representing no matter who sets it on
Street power, why you niggaz flip and you thug shit
I be bout my motherfucking grip, nothing else
Gets between me and mine, just remember that
Damn it's a shame, but still I'm in the game
I'm trying to get street fame

I'm a superstar.., I'm a superstar...
I'm a superstar, made it by street fame
I'm a superstar.., I'm a superstar...
I'm a superstar, made it by street fame

(Big Syke)
Don't blame my mama, don't blame my daddy
I know they wish they never had me
In and out of jail by twelve, failing out of school
'Cause I was living by the street rules
Hanging with hogs, dropping dogs as a little loc
I was getting my respect but I was still broke
Into the game and expanded to the cocaine
Went from double-ups, to slanging them whole things
Focused on my mail name ringing like a bell
And even with no proof they gonna put me in jail
Everybody says he's sold and I'm outta control
Motherfuckers gossip but I still roll (nigga)
Bitches want my cash on my dash of my cockpit
They wouldn't know a motherfucker if he didn't have shit
So while I'm balling and kicking up dust, get yo' skull crushed
Bitch-made niggaz know not to fuck with us
'Cause I'm living on the edge, I'm blasting lead
Wanted by the Feds, they got to take me dead
So fuck it drive a bucket in the inner city
In the land of no pity, I made it by the street fame

I'm a superstar.., I'm a superstar...
I'm a superstar, made it by street fame
I'm a superstar.., I'm a superstar...
I'm a superstar, made it by street fame

(The Rated R)
I'm a super star, made it by street fame
I had to make some people feel the pain, in this dirty game
I know I'm on my way to hell
Ain't no yellow bricked road for all the niggas that I done smoked
The hood done took me under, a nigga gots no heart
Don't get it twisted 'cause I'm there with my homey's car
I kill for my niggaz, my niggaz kill for me
That's the love you get, from the drunk one, you put in work see
I'm a G with a gang of niggaz after me
Trying to peal me, 'cause I smoked they homey
What comes around goes around is what makes it worse
I smoke blunts all day to keep my mind off a hearse
They don't stop stop till my casket drop drop
Let me ride, but all I want, thou shalt not beef or die
And it don't matter if I rap or plays
'Cause I blow out back of some minds, fuck the fame

I'm a superstar.., I'm a superstar...
I'm a superstar, made it by street fame
I'm a superstar.., I'm a superstar...
I'm a superstar, made it by street fame

... Made it by street fame
(Repeat to the end)

(You want me to do what ?) What is it?
Fair exchange, Fair exchange ain't no robbery,
(I do you, you do me... haha)
Fair exchange, Fair exchange ain't no robbery.
(Everything's legal baby, everything's legal)

(Verse One: 2Pac)
Picture of perfection, the object of a nigga affection
Partners in passionate sex, a place to put my erection
Fantasies of you in submission, freaky positions
Pushing permanent twisting I'm on a mission got me on the mash
Tried to dig, you was screaming when I did
Steady yelling out spots for me to hit, and aww shit
Soon as I seen her saw us playing hide the Weiner
Wanna Freak Like Me, fuck Adina
Up and down is the object, side to side
Make you holler out my name when a thug nigga ride, can I come inside
Say you don't feel it that's a lie, you just scared to get this
Penitentiary dick, the trot caught your eye
When I walked by, I said, Hi
But you was so shy, I can't lie, damn near stuttered when you walked by
You want me to lick it and even worse
Got your heart set on me going first, and that ain't no 'Fair Xchange'

Fair exchange, Fair exchange ain't no robbery,
(Motherfucker, mutherfucker) (hahaha yeah nigga)
Fair exchange, Fair exchange ain't no robbery,
(Mothafucker, motherfucker)

(Verse Two: 2Pac)
Open your legs got me watching like it's a million
You tremble from the feelin' look up, 'cause I got mirrors on the ceiling
And if you willing, then we can ride until the sun shine
And just for fun, I bet you I can make you cum sixty-one times
Close your eyes, let me heat it up
'Cause when we fuck I refuse to bust a nut until I beat it up
Drop the top, time to fuck while the wind blow
Baby throw yo' legs out the window
Remember on the balcony, bend over baby bounce on me
And let me hit it where it counts and flee
Remember me? 'I Get Around', and I'm haunted by my temptations
Sexual participation, my motivation
Even though I like the way you work it
You don't deserve it cause you walk around acting like you perfect
Took a while but I finally got it, and like a boss player
Bitch you ain't doing me no favours, 'Fair Xchange'

Fair exchange, Fair exchange ain't no robbery
Fair exchange, Fair exchange ain't no robbery

(Verse Three: 2Pac)
Now yo' attitude ain't realistic
Yeah it's true I'm getting pussy, but baby you getting dick!
And since you being laced with the penetration
It's only right to show a form of appreciation
Instead of faking like you can't hear the bed shaking
In bed naked you so twisted think yoour legs breaking
You said take it so I'm blind in my passion, how long will I last?
Doggy style steady pumping on that ass, until I blast
And then I laugh as we lay back
See I wait till you asleep and that's the payback
Cause you acting like you did something, giving me a piece
I had you muffling your screams in the sheets, fucking with me
A true digger that love triggers, a thug nigga
Hustling bitches like drug dealers
Before I say goodbye, put an end to all the games
Here's my number for another 'Fair Xchange'

Fair exchange, Fair exchange ain't no robbery
Fair exchange, Fair exchange ain't no robbery
Fair exchange, Fair exchange ain't no robbery
Fair exchange, Fair exchange ain't no robbery
Fair exchange, Fair exchange ain't no robbery
Fair exchange, Fair exchange ain't no robbery
(DJ Quik)
Hey Pac, it's yo boy
Hey man so far I've been listening to your album
And I ain't heard nothing you could kick back and smoke a beady to
You know?

Yeah like that
Some of that mellow shit
Some of that shit that make bitches drink
Make niggaz think
And help you check a fat-ass bank, hahahah
So why don't you kick some of that shit nigga only you know how
Hahahah, feel me?

(Tupac)
I'm barely standing and plus my secondhand say it's midnight
Some Alize and Cristal guaranteed to get right
Like misdemeanours is a small thing
With DJ Quik in this bitch, I let my balls hang
Running through the street lights 'cause we like
Young nigga get your mob on show 'em what a G like
Around the corner it's like Vegas, or better yet like Reno
Niggaz popping, welcome to our casino
Cause you and me know hundred percent like a c-note
Looking for a bitch that's half-black and Filipino
And when I meet her I'ma offer her some Indo
Tongue-kissing on the window of a pearl white limo
Don't wanna be your man, I'm your nigga touch me here, I'll get bigger
While I'm digging I'll get deep into your liver
I'm game tight love fucking bitches in the same night
My words are aphrodisiacs if you say 'em right
The club be popping so I'm stopping at the Fat Burger
Look through the paper it's another black crack murder
The city's full of surprises, you can live or you can die
You can fuck on the first night, or try, in the 'Late Night'


* DJ Quik cuts and scratches this sequence 2X*

Last night... last night changed it all
'Pac) In the late night
Last night...
(I don't give a fuck, where you gon'.. be ... do it myself)
(Pac) In the late night

(Hussein Fatal)
Around my way we lamp, many styles get cramped
I clock rocks in the rain till my socks is damp
Ain't nothing like being a thug when I can just
Sit on the Row of Death straight knowing that I'm blessed
Hussein Fatal, flawless fatality
Overdosing on crime, three steps from reality
Get up to get down, represent the town
Last night was popping like like cocked glocks with hollow-tip rounds

(Kadafi)
From booty calls to bail sheets
It ain't no telling if I wake up in the county in my jail sheets
My intuitions and the bitches up in the late night
Probably involves me coming up with just to see another day
Might, If me who ride the bullet in these streets where a man journey
With crooked cops and a society who trying to burn me
I'm like a pit in a cage spitting my shells in a gauge
Deadly as aids niggaz getting crossed like a maze
Now picture me living my life like a king maybe one day
Chilling I'm living Monday through Sunday
Bringing the gun play for all these beefs and battles
When we collide I'm a ride on that hide like cattle
Cowards best to skedaddle in the late night


(2Pac)
Money and multiple gunshots are shown large amps are blown
Niggaz in low-lows, pursuing more hoes, then go home
The life of a California star
And when you see me in the drop-top Jag how many niggaz wanna be me?
Game is automatic mandatory I sell
To Live or Die, I survive, but with a story to tell
'Cause when you gettin' some riches watch for dumb bitches
They have you labeled a rapist before you get to tongue-kissin'
It's a mean world nigga you strapped, or be a throwaway
Will I survive the late night, to see dawn of day?
Nobody knows me, I'm a shadow
My army fatigues made for battle, pockets full of ammo
'Cause when I'm out in the streets, I'm on point, where the static?
Too many done died from semis, so now we automatic
I disappear whenever heated ride whenever needed
For my niggaz up in Clinton getting weeded
Continue to roll until I'm old, ride until I die
Supply long as you motherfuckers buy
My homies rolled by in a bucket, but they ain't short and ducking
Slapping niggaz known for telling bitches fuck-it in the late night
(2pac)
Haha, for all my niggaz in the hood (yeah)
That live the life of a ghetto star
(You KNOW!) Heh, you know how we do it
(Hahaha, Makaveli!)
Just holla my name and witness game official
Niggaz is so ashamed they stand stiff like scared bitches
While I remain inside a paradox called my block
Though gunshots is promised to me, when will I stop?
I hit the weed and hope to God I can fly high
Witness my enemies die when I ride by, they shouldn'ta tried
I send they bodies to they parents up North
With they faces, they wrists and they nuts cut off
Fuck 'em all what I scream as I dream in tongues
Fuck a trick, get me rich and the bitches'll come
Bust my gun, make 'em all scatter
Bullets to my nuts only made my balls fatter, eat a dick BEYOTCH!
Mercy, never that, you say you comin' back?
Bring it on, fo' whoever strapped
Introduce you to the pleasure and the pain, you can go so far
Just sell me your soul, and live the life... (of a ghetto star)

(Nutso)
I live the life of a thug nigga, drug dealer livin' game tight
Mug niggaz, slug niggaz for the famed life
Laced with game, practiced on taking pain,
Quick to slang, and let it rain through your brain,
Street smart, proficient, intelligent,
And keep suckers hittin till snitches start smellin,
Movin niggaz with telekinesis,
Keeping Channel Seven at work filming different features,
Leadin niggaz to an early death with they head blown,
And to those who didn't make it to the morgue, was just dead and gone,
And hope niggaz got punished,
Kidnapped jacked in the back with macs to they neck,
Rats waitin to get done in,
Tossed his ass out, mob related,
One more nigga found shot up with his dick in his mouth,
Printed my name in these streets as a motherfucking G
Now the next generation's looking up to me.


(2Pac)
Walkin' through the cemetery
Talkin' to my homies that was buried
See my enemies wanna see me dead, I ain't worried, forgive me
Please give me shelter, calm my fears
Lifted my head, from my hands, had a palm of tears
I see bodies gettin' splashed, with acid
Two shots rang from the plastic glock, wrapped in plastic
Buried the bastard, time to notify, his family
Shiiit, ain't nuttin left to be identified
Evacuate the crime scene fast
Why I heard the Feds had a warrant for my ass
Fly, I won't touch down till I see Tiajuana
Set up shop sellin them crooked cops marijuana
Label me a success, I made the switch
Retired from the life that never gave me shit
With cash that I couldn't spend, countless cars
An addict for a wife, my life, as a ghetto star

(Nutso)
Got the word that some nerds wanna plot on this
Hit the curve, let it swerve, had to stop they grip
No remorse, no repentance as I buck one down
Straight to the morgue 'cause I plan on, shut ya down
Born soldiers! -- Fucked him up with a mac folder
Torn ligaments, all up in that nigga's shoulder
And a vest couldn't protect that flesh
'Cause I got, slugs, to knock the air out your chest
Death, apparently they wasn't sucker free
'Cause I had all them wannabe thug niggaz in protective custody
I guess they heard that I got them birds
Thought I was a nerd till I fucked one of them to the curb
Luxury livin' lavish, with dreams of dyin' rich
With a team and clientele on my motherfuckin dick
And gettin' down on these snitch bitches, protectin riches
By givin' stitches, my life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like dem (and live my life as a ghetto star)
When I grow up I wanna be like dem (and live my life as a ghetto star)
When I grow up I wanna be like dem (and live my life as a ghetto star)
When I grow up I wanna be like dem (and live my life as a ghetto star)
When I grow up I wanna be like dem (and live my life as a ghetto star)
When I grow up I wanna be like dem (and live my life as a ghetto star)

(Outro: 2Pac w/ Nutso talking in background)
This goes out to all you motherfuckers
That STILL, have to kill to make that money
All you niggaz on the block, sellin rocks
Hand to hand, runnin' from the police
I see you - live your life as a ghetto star!
Talk to the hood, claimin you gettin' riches
Runnin' from the flags... live my life as a ghetto star
Niggaz with two strikes that don't wanna see the third, I feel you
Shit, tired of getting shot at
Tired of getting chased by the police and arrested
Niggaz need a spot where WE can kick it
A spot where WE belong, that's just for us
Niggaz ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Ya know what I mean? Where do niggaz go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a G
... At thug mansion

(Verse One: 2Pac)
A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times
I once contemplated suicide and would have tried
But when I held that 9, all I could see was my moma's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowing it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Praying hard for 'Better Dayz', promise to hold on
Me and my dogs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We finally found a spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places, that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go in fast
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at 'Thugz Mansion'

(Chorus: J. Phoenix + (Nas)
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessey, laid back and cool
Every hour, 'cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be all right (I wanna go)
Nothing but peace (I wanna go) love (I wanna go nigga)
And street passion, every ghetto needs a thug mansion

(Verse Two: Nas)
A place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide
Not to start beef but spark trees, no cops rolling by
No policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets
No reason, for nobody's momma to cry
See I'm a good guy, I'm trying to stick around for my daughter
But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her
This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me
Only difference from me and Ozzie Davis, grey hair maybe
'Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much suffering
I'm just twenty-some-odd years, I done lost my mother
And I cry tears of joy, I know she smiles on her boy
I dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur
Cause like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war
And just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more
Cause one day we'll all be together, sipping heavenly champagne
Where angels soar, with golden wings in 'Thugz Mansion'

(Chorus w/o Nas)

(Verse Three: 2Pac)
Dear momma don't cry, your baby boy's doing good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drinking peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday
Sang sitting there kicking it with Malcolm, till the day came
Little LaTasha sure grown
Tell the lady in the liquor that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cutting loose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm asking
Remember this face, save me a place, in thug's mansion
spoken:
The only way, for me to come back, is by Makaveli
That's it! All these motherfuckers stole from me
I'm takin' back what's mine

(Slowed Vocals)
(Laughing)
You motherfuckers can't stop me
Even if I die, I'm gonna be a fuckin' problem
Do you believe in ghosts, motherfucker?
Real live black... ghosts
Feel me?

Some say I'm crazy, these punk-ass cops can't fade me
Mama tried to raise me, but had too many babies
Papa was a motherfuckin', joke
Used to find dope in his coat
And nearly choked when he'd tell me not to smoke
Damn, don't get me started
My mama smoked so God damn much
When she was pregnant I'm surprised I ain't retarded
At night I can't sleep, can't peep
As they pass through the glass of my neighbors five deep
Starin' at the wall, heard a scream
Wake up in the mornin'
See the blood in the hall from the murder scene
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby
On the corner, where the niggaz slang they crack
And the undercovers jack those that don't watch they back
(Five-OH!) I daydream about the dope world
Take a puff from the blunt and watch the smoke swirl
My Mossberg goes BOOM, what's another plug
Snatchin' drugs, pumpin' slugs in these other thugs
(GIVE IT UP NIGGA) Don't run out of breath
Every step could be death till you blast
And be the last nigga left, then I'll be ghost

Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby

A seven-deuce full of niggaz goes by
Thought I was trippin' the second time they rolled, by
Recognized the plates, the faces looked familiar
But everybody swear they know the nigga that's gonna, kill ya
Don't murder me murder me, kill a nigga in his sleep
Let me die as I rest in peace, deep
Back to these niggaz in the seven-deuce
A mac-10 out the window bout to let it loose, what could I do?
Run for cover and return fire
DIE MOTHERFUCKIN' DIE, hope yo' ass fry, don't ask why
But I let off everything I have
An empty clip, hit the ground as a nigga dash
On my ass was the motherfuckin' cops now
Barely breathin' tryin' to keep from gettin' shot down
BOO-YOW is the sound, bullet whizzed by
Still runnin' like a nigga got nine lives
Don't know why but I'm runnin' to my fuckin' block
Took a shot, tired of runnin' from the niggaz and the cops
Time to be a ghost
(Hey man, come the fuck on!)
And then we'll be ghost

Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby

(Tupac - speaking)
FUCK THE POLICE NIGGA! (laughing)

Child: Why you by the window?, what's wrong daddy?
Mother: I know what's wrong with that crazy motherfucker
He's just stand by the goddamn window
With that fuckin' AK all day
You don't work, you don't fuck, you don't,
You don't do a goddamn thing

I see death around the corner, gotta stay high while I survive
In the city where the skinny niggas die
If they bury me, bury me as a G nigga, no need to worry
I expect retaliation in a hurry
I see death around the corner, any day
Trying to keep it together, no one lives forever anyway
Strugglin' and strivin', my destiny's to die
Keep my finger on the trigger, no mercy in my eyes
In a ball of confusion, I think about my daddy
Madder than a motherfucker, they never shoulda had me
I guess I seen too many murders, the doctors can't help me
Got me stressin' with my pistol in my sheets, it ain't healthy
Am I paranoid? Tell me the truth
I'm out the window with my AK, ready to shoot
Ran out of endo and my mind can't take the stress,
I'm out of breath
Make me wanna kill my damn self,
But I see death around the corner


(When we were kids, belonging felt good)
I see death around the corner
(But having respect, that feels even better)
I see death around the corner
(When we were kids, belonging felt good)
I see death around the corner
(But having respect, that feels even better)

I see death around the corner,
The pressure's getting to me
I no longer trust my homies,
Them phonies tried to do me
Smoking too much weed,
Got me paranoid, stressed
Pack a gat and my vest,
Under my clothes when I dress
Here's hopin' I die the way I lived,
Straight thuggin'
Huggin' my trigger for all them niggas
That was buggin'
My homie told me once,
Don't you trust them other suckers
They fought like they your homies
But they phony motherfuckers
And even if I did die young, who cares
All I ever got was mean mugs and cold stares
I got homies in my head
Who done passed away screamin', please
Young nigga, make Gs
I can't give up, although I'm hopeless,
I think my mind's gone
All I can do is get my grind on, death around the corner


I was raised in the city, shitty
Ever since I was an itty bitty kitty
Drinkin' liquor out my momma's titty
And smokin' weed was an everyday thang in my household,
And drinking liquor till you out cold
And tho' I'm gone now, nigga it's still on- Pow
Bustin' on them niggas till they gone
How many more jealous ass bitches, comin' for my riches
Now I gotta stay suspicious when I bone
'Cause if I ain't sharp and heartless,
Them bitches will start shit
Excuse me, but this is where we part bitch
No more game for free, please explain to me
Why niggas trip bitch, who you came to see?
Murderin' now but see me later man, as for my pops
I got homies that will hunt you till you drop
I hope the Lord will forgive me, I was a G
And gettin' high was a way of gettin' free
I see death around the corner


This is for all the real mothafuckin' niggas out there
I know you ain't scared to die
We all gotta go, ya know?
A real motherfucker will pick the time he goes
And make sure he handles his motherfuckin' business
Y'all niggas stop acting like pussies out there,
All right

(Movie bites)

I'm tired off getting ripped off by guys like that

I want his family dead, I want his house burned to the ground
I want to got there in the middle of the night,
I wanna piss on his head
I want his family dead, I want his house burned to the ground
I want to got there in the middle of the night,
I wanna piss on his head

I want that son of a bitch dead, I want him dead
I want him dead, I don't care

Between you and Biggie was like who gon', who gon'
Who rules the entertainment industry, basically
I was like this, is like a fuckin' election, you know what I'm sayin'?

It is, it is that me and Biggie situation was smaller
Than that me and Biggie situation was like

Why am I fighting to live if I 'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no-one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

Check it, I grew up a fucking screw up
Got introduced to the game got an ounce and fucking blew up
Chopping rocks over night
The nigga Biggie Smalls trying to turn into black Frank White

We had a code dress to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missing
Showed they codes know they got stepped on
A fist full of bullets, a chest full of Teflon

Run from the police, picture that
Nigga I'm too fat, I fuck around and catch an asthma attack
That's why I bust back and don't face me
When he drop take his glock and I'm swayze

Celebrate my escape, sold a glock
Bust some weight, lay back I got some money to make
Motherfucker

Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no-one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die? (It's on me)

But still I'm having memories of high speed when the cops crash
As I laugh pushing the gas while my glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb but we had heart
In the dark will we survive through the bad parts

Many dreams is what I had and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me
A couple movies now the whole worlds trying to screw me

Even the cops trying to sue me, so what can I do but stay true
Sippin' twenty two's of brew
And now the media is trying to test me
Got the prest asking question, tryin' to stress me

Misery is all I see, that's my mind state
My history with the police's shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes, slip got arrested and flipped
He screamed "Thug life!" and emptied a clip
Got shot runnin' from the police

Why am I fighting to live if I 'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no-one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

I was shocked at everything, know what I'm sayin'?
But I wasn't more shocked of him dying
I was more shocked at him

Pac is a strong dude, you know, I know, dude, know what I'm sayin'?
He's real strong
So when they was like he got shot I was more like "Again?"
Huh, you know what I'm sayin'?

He always gettin' shot or shot at
He gon' pull through this one again
Make a few records about it and it's goin' to be over
You know what I'm sayin'?

But he when he died I was like "Oh!"
You know what I'm sayin'?
But even though we was going through our drama
I will never wish death on nobody, you know
'Cause they be coming back from death
Aww yeah, uh, uh
Holla if ya hear me, yeah!

(Verse One)
Here we go, turn it up, let's start
From block to block we snatchin hearts and jackin marks
And the punk police can't fade me, and maybe
We can have peace someday G
But right now I got my mind set up
Lookin' down the barrel of my nine, get up
'Cause it's time to make the payback fat
To my brothers on the block better stay strapped, black
And accept no substitutes
I bring truth to the youth tear the roof off the whole school
Oh no, I won't turn the other cheek
In case ya can't see us while we burn the other week
Now we got him in a smash, blast
How long will it last till the po' gettin' mo' cash
Until then, raise up!
Tell my young black males, blaze up!
Life's a mess don't stress, test
I'm givin' but be thankful that you're livin', blessed
Much love to my brothers in the pen
See ya when I free ya if not when they shove me in
Once again it's an all out scrap
Keep your hands on ya gat, and now ya boys watch ya back
Cause in the alleys out in Cali I'ma tell ya
Mess with the best and the vest couldn't help ya
Scream, if ya feel me; see it clearly?
You're too near me -

(2Pac) Holla if ya hear me!
"Hard!" ... "Tellin' you to hear it, the rebel" - P.E.
"Tellin' you to hear it.."

"Tellin' you to hear it.."

(Verse Two)
Pump ya fists like this
Holla if ya hear me - PUMP PUMP if you're pissed
To the sell-outs, livin' it up
One way or another you'll be givin' it up, huh
I guess 'cause I'm black born
I'm supposed to say peace, sing songs, and get capped on
But it's time for a new plan, BAM!
I'll be swingin' like a one man, clan
Here we go, turn it up, don't stop
To my homies on the block gettin' dropped by cops
I'm still around for ya
Keepin' my sound underground for ya
And I'ma throw a change up
Quayle, like you never brought my name up
Now my homies in the backstreets, the blackstreets
They feel me when they rollin' in they fat jeeps
This ain't just a rap song, a black song
Tellin' all my brothers, get they strap on
And look for me in the struggle
Hustlin till other brothers bubble -

(2Pac) Holla if ya hear me!
"Tellin' you to hear it, the rebel" - P.E.
"Tellin' you to hear it.."
(2Pac) Holla if ya hear me!
"Hard!" ... "Tellin' you to hear it, the rebel" - P.E.
"Tellin' you to hear it.."
(2Pac) Holla if ya hear me!
"Hard!" ... "Tellin' you to hear it, the rebel" - P.E.
"Tellin' you to hear it.."
(2Pac) Holla if ya hear me!
"Hard!" ... "Tellin' you to hear it, the rebel" - P.E.
"Tellin' you to hear it.."
(2Pac) Holla if ya hear me!

(Verse Three)
Will I quit, will I quit?
They claim that I'm violent, but still I keep
Representin, never give up, on a good thing
Wouldn't stop it if we could it's a hood thing
And now I'm like a major threat
'Cause I remind you of the things you were made to forget
Bring the noise, to all my boyz
Know the real from the bustas and the decoys
And if ya hustle like a real G
Pump ya fists if ya feel me, holla if ya hear me
Learn to survive in the nine-tre'
I make rhyme pay, others make crime pay
Whatever it takes to live and stand
Cause nobody else'll give a damn
So we live like caged beasts
Waitin for the day to let the rage free
Still me, till they kill me
I love it when they fear me -

(2Pac) Holla if ya hear me!
"Tellin' you to hear it, the rebel" - P.E.
"Tellin' you to hear it.."
(2Pac) Holla if ya hear me!
"Hard!" ... "Tellin' you to hear it, the rebel" - P.E.
"Tellin' you to hear it.."
(2Pac) Holla if ya hear me!
"Hard!" ... "Tellin' you to hear it, the rebel" - P.E.
"Tellin' you to hear it.."
(2Pac) Holla if ya hear me!
"Hard!" ... "Tellin' you to hear it, the rebel" - P.E.
"Tellin' you to hear it.."

(2Pac) You're too near me, to see it clearly

(2Pac) Holla if ya hear me!
"Hard!" ... "Tellin' you to hear it, the rebel" - P.E.
"Tellin' you to hear it.."

"Hard!" ... "Tellin' you to hear it, the rebel" - P.E.
"Tellin' you to hear it.."

"Hard!" ... "The rebel"
"Hard!" ... "The rebel"

(Repeat 12X to fade)
(2Pac) Holla if ya hear me!
"Hard!" ... "The rebel"
Starin' through my rearview
Just lookin' back at the world
From another level
Starin'...

Multiple gunshots fill the block, the fun stops
Niggaz is callin cops, people shot, nobody stop
I wonder when the world stopped caring last night
Two kids shot while the whole block staring
I will never understand this society, first they try
To murder me, then they lie to me, product of a dying breed
All my homies trying weed, now the little baby's
Crazed raised off Hennesey, tell me will my enemies
Flee when they see me, believe me
Even Thugs gotta learn to take it easy, listen
Through the intermissions search your heart for a plan
And we turnin' Bad Boys to grown men, it's on again

I give a holla to my niggaz in the darkest corners
Roll a perfect blunt, and let me spark it for ya
One love from a thug nigga rollin' with a posse
Full of paranoid drug dealers, to the end my friend

I'm seein nuttin but my dreams comin' true
While I'm starin' at the world through my rearview,
See I'm seein nuttin but my dreams comin' true
While I'm starin' at the world through my rearview see
They got me starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin time fly, and all my motherfuckers
They got me starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die (we)
Gettin' high, watchin time fly, and all my motherfuckers

(E.D.I.)
Now you see em, now you don't, some niggaz
Be here for the moment, and then they gone, what happened to em?
Well let's see, it seems to be a mystery
But all I know I never let the money get to me
Stay down like the, truest
Thug life until I check out of this bitch, I thought you'd know this
Who is, gonna catch me when I fall or even care to
While you thinkin' I see you lost up in my rearview
Half you, is down with them Outlawz
Outcast, left far, I feel like southpaws
But still we keep mashin till our dreams come through
Starin' at the world through my rearview

(Tupac)
Now I was raised as a young black male
In order to get paid, forced to make crack sales
Caught a nigga so they send me to these overpacked jails
In the cell, countin' days in this livin' black Hell, do you feel me?
Keys to ignition, use at your discretion
Roll with a twelve gauge pump for protection
Niggaz hate me in the section from years of chin checkin'
Turn to Smith and Wesson war weapons
Heavenly Father I'm a soldier, I'm gettin' hotter
Cause the world's gettin' colder, baby let me hold ya
Talk to my guns like they fly bitches
All you bustas best to run look at my bitches

Now I know the answers to the question, do dreams come true
Still starin' at the world through my rearview
I say
Now I know the answers to the question, do dreams come true
Still starin' at the world through my rearview
They got me starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin time fly and all my motherfuckers
Starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin time fly nigga can die

(Kadaffi)
Back in the days we hustled for sneakers and beepers
Nine-six for glocks cause fiends hittin up blocks with street sweepers
Bless myself when knowin' rules to these streets, somethin' I learned
In school, on some Million Man March shit for the peace
True that, only one life to lead, a fast life of greed
Criminally addicted, infested since the seed
We all die, breed bleed like humans, towns run
By young guns, Outlawz and truants, shit's deep
Turn eighteen, burn my will when I go
Burn my body with my shotty, or choosin' my dough
So while you reminiscin all nights out with the crew
Smoke a blunt for me too while starin' through your rearview

(Tupac)
Hahahaha, you ain't knowin' what we mean by starin' through the rearview
So since you ain't knowin' what we mean let me break down understandin
The world, the world is behind us
Once a motherfucker get an understanding on the game
And what the levels and the rules of the game is
Then the world ain't no trick no more
The world is a game to be played
So now we lookin' at the world, from like, behind us
Niggaz know what we gotta do, just gotta put our mind to it and do it
It's all about the papers, money rule the world
Bitches make the world go round
Real niggaz do they wanna do, bitch niggaz do what they can't

Starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin time fly, ya know
Starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin time flyand we'll be
Starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
Heart beatin' fast... time to die
High, watchin time fly, ya know
Starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you heart beatin' fast... time to die
High, watchin time fly
(Yeah)
Bury me a G
Thug Life for life

(2pac)

Thinkin' back
Reminiscing on my teens
A young G
Gettin' paid over dope fiends
Fuckin' off cash that I make
Nigga, what's tha sense of workin hard
If you never get to play
I'm hustlin'
Stayin' out till it's dawn
And commin' home
At 6 o'clock in tha mornin'
Hand's on my glock
Eye's on tha prize
Finger on tha trigga when a nigga ride
Shootin' craps
Bustin' niggas out tha door
Pick my money off tha floor
God bless tha trife folks
Stuck on full, drunk again
Sippin' on Gin
With a couple of friends
Sayin' them thug life niggas be like major pimps
Stickin' to tha rules is what made it simp (Biatch)
And if I die
Let it be
But when they come for me
Bury me a G

I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my mothafucken riches
Even when I die
They won't worry me
Mama don't cry
Bury me a G

(Mopreme Shakur)

More Trouble than tha average
Just made 25 and I'm livin' like a savage
Bein a G ain't no easy thing
Cause you could fuck around get crossed
And get stuck in tha game
And for tha rest of your life you will sit and reminicse
Wonder why it had to end like this
And to tha G's you can feel my pain
Till tha mothafucka gets born again

(The Rated R)
You thought I was a game kid
I'm not tha nigga for playin' games
I let my buckshots rang
When I pull tha trigga on my gauge
I'm on a rampage
Makin' runs for tha devil
Ain't nothin' on my mind
But gettin' in some trouble
I'm tryin' to ride
No more loves
For me hard to figure
Get a nigga for some blunts
Or in some jewelry store (break that shit)
I gives a fuck nigga
Stuck outta luck
When I bust
Put me to my death
But I'm a G till the end of me

I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my mothafucken riches
Even when I die
They won't worry me
Mama don't cry
Bury me a G

(Big Syke)
I got nothin' ta loose so I choose to be a killer
Went from bangin' and slangin'
Now I'm a dope dealer
All my life paid tha price to be tha boss
Back in school
Broke tha rules I'm getten' tossed
Poppin' rocks on tha block was a past time
Pack a 9 all the time
You wanna test mine?
Don't cry
I die before they play me
From tha cradle to tha grave
Bury me

Straight up
Kickin' it with tha homies in tha hood
Gettin' drunk, smokin' blunts
A bitch said I'm no good
I gives a fuck
I spend my time in a dope spot
Never had no time for no bitch
Just slangin' rocks
And bustin' caps on your punk ass marks
Fake ass G's
Bitch niggaz with no heart
I'm stayin' real till I'm 6 feet deep
So when a nigga gone
Bury me a G

I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my mothafuckin riches
Even when I die
They won't worry me
Mama don't cry
Bury Me a G

(2pac)
Stuck on Full
Tangaray got a nigga high
Lord knows I don't need another DUI

Heartless hustler
Just 'cause I fucked
Don't mean I trust her
Now my pagers vibratin'
Can't sleep
So I'm mobbin' to tha ho's house
Pumpin' Isely
Is it cool ta fuck is what I'm askin
Bitch recognize game and start laughin'
When I'm all in those guts and shit (Nigga you crazy)
Prayin' that a nigga don't nut too quick
'Cause I'll fuck and get up and let ya know
I'll be a 10 minute brotha for a $2 ho
Lots a ho's get mad and shit

Real niggas turn ta bustas

As real as it seems the American Dream
Ain't nothing but another calculated scheme
To get us locked up shot up or back in chains
To deny us of the future rob our names
Kept my history a mystery but now I see
The American Dream wasn't meant for me
Cause lady liberty's a hypocrite she lied to me
Promised me freedom, education, equality
Never gave me nothing but slavery
And now look at how dangerous you made me
Calling me a mad man 'cause I'm strong and bold
With this gun full of knowledge of the lies you told
Promise me emancipation in this new nation
All you gave my people was our patience
Fathers of our country never cared for me
They kept my ancestors shackled up in slavery
And Uncle Sam never did a damn thing for me
Except lie about the facts in my history
So now I'm sitting here mad 'cause I'm unemployed
But the government's glad 'cause they enjoy it
When my people are down so they can screw us around
Time to change the government now panther power

Panther power
Panther power
Panther power

Tyson
Panther power from the strength that resides within
Go toe to toe with a panther and you just can't win
Suffered fame bats suppressed the rest
The rich get richer and the poor take less
The American Dream was an American nightmare
You kept my people down and refuse to fight fair
The Klu Klux Klan tried to keep us out
With signs drew they know no blacks allowed
With intimidation and segregation was a way for our freedom
But now we're impatient
Blacks the other skin: dead or sell outs
Freedom, equality, then I'll yell out
"Don't you ever be ashamed of what you are
It's ya panther power that makes you a star"
Panther power

Panther power
Panther power
Panther power

Tupac
My Mother never let me forget my history
Hoping I was set free chains never put on me
Wanted to be more than just free
Had to know the true facts about my history
I couldn't settle for being a statistic
Couldn't survive in this capitalistic
Government cause it was meant to hold us back
Using ignorant, drugs, to sneak attack
In my community they killed the unity
But when I charged them, tried to claim immunity
I strike America like a case of hard disease
Panther power is running through my arteries
Try to stop oh boy you'll be clawed to death
'Cause I'll be fighting for my freedom with my dying breath
Do you remember that is what I'm asking you?
You think you living free don't let me laugh at you
Open your eyes realize that you have been locked in chains
Said you wasn't civilized and stole your name
Cause some time has passed seem you all forget
There ain't no liberty to you and me we all ain't free yet
Panther power

Panther power
Panther power

As real as it seems the American Dream
Ain't nothing but another calculate schemes
To get us locked up shot up or back in chains
To deny us of the future rob our names
Kept my history a mystery but now I see
The American Dream wasn't meant for me
Cause lady liberty's a hypocrite she lied to me
Promised me freedom, education, equality
Never gave me nothing but slavery
And now look at how dangerous you made me
Calling me a mad man 'cause I'm strong and bold
With this gun full of knowledge of the lies you told
Promise me emancipation in this new nation
All you ever gave my people was our patience
Fathers of our country never cared for me
They kept my answer shackled up in slavery
And Uncle Sam never did a damn thing for me
Except lie about the facts in my history
So now I'm sitting hear mad 'cause I'm unemployed
But the government's glad 'cause they enjoy it
When my people are down so they can screw us around
Time to change the government now panther power

Panther power
Panther power
Panther power
I would share the definition of ballin' with you white folks...
But now...
The game is to be sold and not told
So eh, fuck me

(Tupac)
I'm up before the sunrise, first to hit the block.
Little bad mothafucka with a pocket full of rocks.
Learn to throw them thangs, get my skinny little ass kicked.
And niggas laugh, till tha first mothafucka got blasted.
I put the nigga in his casket,
Now they coverin' the basket with plastic.
I smoke blunts on a regular buck when it counts.
I'm tryin' to make a million dollars outta quarter ounce.
And gettin' ghost on the five-o, fuck them hos.
Got a 45 screamin' about survival.
Hey nigga can I lay low, cook some yay-yo.
Hollar one-time when I say so.
Don't want to go to the pen, I'm hittin' fences.
Narcs on a nigga's back, missin' me by inches.
And they say how do you survive weighin' 165
In a city where the skinny niggas die?
Tell Mama don't cry.
Even when they kill me,
They can never take the game from a young G.
I'm str8 ballin'!

Str8 ballin'!

Still on parole and I'm the first nigga servin'
Pour some liquor on the curb for my niggas that deserve it.
But if I want to make a million, gotta stay dealin'.
It's kinda boomin' round the way and today I'll make a killin'.
Dressin' down like a villain', but only on the block.
It's a clever disguise to keep me runnin' from the cops.
Ha, I'm gettin' high. I think I'll die if I don't get no ends.
I'm in a bucket with 'em ridin' it like it's a Benz.
I hate to strip let my music bump,
Drinkin' liquor, and I'm lookin' for some hoes to fuck.
Rather die makin' money than live poor and legal
As I slang another ounce, I wish it was a kilo.
A need money in a major way.
Time to fuck my BEEEYATCH! Hey!, and getten' paid
You other mothafuckas callin',
But me and my mothafuckin' thug niggas,
We str8 ballin'!

Str8 ballin'!

Damned if I don't, and damned if a nigga do.
So watch a young mothafucka pull a trigga just to RAISE UP!
But don't let them see you cry, dry your eyes
Young nigga time to do or die.
I keep a pistol in my pocket,
Ready on my block.
Ain't no time for a nigga to even cock shit.
And now they see that mothafucka beat pain,
At point blank range 'cause he slept on the game.
Ain't a damned thing changed
Shakin' the dice, now roll 'em,
If you can't stand pain better hold 'em.
Cause ain't no tellin' what you might roll.
You might go catch AIDS from a slight cold. Nigga.
Better live your life to the fullest,
You 'bout to kill a fool, got a pistol mothafucka better pull it.
Cause even when they kill me,
They can never take the game from a young G.
We str8 ballin'!

We str8 ballin'!

To my niggas in the penitentiary,
Loked up like a mothafucka when they mention me.
Cause you fuckin' with the realest motha fucka ever born,
And once again it's on,
I'm bustin' on these bitches till they gone.
Who the hell can you get to stop me?
I'm in the projects, parlaying with my posse.
I keep my glock cocked
I need it 'cause they're all shady.
I finally made it
Now these jealous bitches tryin' to FADE me!
I ain't goin' out I'd rather blast back.
I'm on the corner with my niggas watchin' cash stack.
And I came up a long way from food stamps.
And takin' shit from the low-life ghetto tramps.
Could you blame me if they sweat me I'm gonna open fire.
What could I do? Pull my trigga or watch my nigga die.
I'm representin' to the fullest givin' devil slugs.
I'm on the block slangin' drugs with the young thugs.
And mothafucka, we be ballin'!
All mothafuckin' day long, stay strong!
We str8 ballin'.
Rebel, rebel, rebel

(2Pac)
They just can't stand the reign
Or the occasional pain
Of a man like me who goes against the grain.
Sometimes I do it in vain
So wit the little bass and treble ain't missed a
So it's time for me to explain that I'm the rebel.
Cold as the devil.
Straight from the underground, the rebel alone laughs.
They came to see the maniac sychopath.
The critics heard of me and the aftermath.
I don't give a damn and it shows.
A when I do a stage show I wear street clothes.
So they all know me: the lyrical lunatic, the maniac MC.
I give a shout out to your homies.
Maybe then, the critics'll leave your boy alone, G.
On the streets or on TV, it just don't pay the be a truth tellin' MC.
They won't be happy till I'm banned.
The most dangerous weapon: an educated black man.
For point blank in your face, pump up the bass, and join the human race.
I throw peace to the Bay.
'Cause from the jungle to Oaktown, they backin me up all the way.
You know ya gotta love the sound.
It's from the rebel: the rebel of the underground.

He's the rebel: rebel of the underground (4X)

(2Pac)
Now I'm face to face with the devil.
'Cause they breedin more rebels than the whole damn ghetto.
And police brutality,
Put you in a nip and call it technicality.
So you reap what you soe.
So read the wrath of the rebel jackin 'em up once more.
Now the fox is in the henhouse.
Creepin' up on your daughter, while you asleep
I got her sneakin out.
Tupac ain't nuttin nice.
I'll be nothin' how I wanna and do it when I'm gonna.
Now I'm up to no good.
The mastermind of mischief movin more than most could.
So sit and slip into the sound.
Peep the rebel: the rebel of the underground.

He's the rebel: rebel of the underground (4X)

(2Pac)
They say they hate me, they wanna hold me down.
I guess they scared of the rebel: the rebel of the underground.
But I never let it get me.
I just make another record 'bout the punks tryin' to sweat me.
In fact, they tryin' to keep me out.
Try to censor what I say 'cause they don't like what I'm talkin' 'bout.
So what's wrong with the media today.
Got brothers sellin out 'cause they greedy to get paid.
But me, I'm comin' from the soul.
And if it don't go gold, my story still get told.
And that way they can't stop me.
And if it sells a couple of copies, the punks'll try to copy.
It's sloppy, don't even try to.
I'm a slave to the rhythm and I'm about to fly through.
Sold yo (ya-yo) to the people in the ghetto.
When ya hear the bass roll, go ahead and let go.
Now everybody wanna gangbang.
They talkin' street slang, but the punk still can't hang.
By makin' records bout violence
But when it comes to the real, some brothers go silent.
It kinda make you wanna think about
That ya gotta do some sellin out, just to get your record out.
But 2pacalpyse is straight down.
So feel the wrath of the rebel: the rebel of the underground.

2pac is the rebel: rebel of the underground (8X)
(Gunshot)

Tupac put a cross on his back, You wanna put crosses on yo back
Nigga, you ain't Tupac

(Tupac)

Money and women, funny beginning's tragic ending's

And since my life is based on sinnin', I'm hell bound
Rather be buried that be worried, livin' held down
My game plan to be trained in
Military mind of a thug lord sittin' in a cemetery cryin
I've been lost since my adolescence calling for Jesus
Ballin' as a youngster wondering if he see's us
Young black males
Crack sales got me three strikes
Livin' in jail this is hell enemies die
Wonder when we all pass, is anybody listnin'
Got my hands on my semi shotty, everybody's snitchin'
Please god can you understand me, bless my family
Guide us all before we fall into insanity
I'm makin' a point to make my beatin' bumpin' raw life
Drop some shit to make these stupid bitches jaw tight

(50 Cent (Tupac))
Till makaveli return it's all eyes on me- on me (what do we have here now)
And you can hate it or love it, but that's what it's go'n be- go'n be
Shoulda listened, I told you not to fuck wit me- wit me (what do we have here now)
Now can you take the pressure, that's what we go'n see- go'n see

(50 Cent)
This is a cry for mercy, I promise
My success would be the death of you
Low and behold, you sold ya soul, there's nothing left of you
Look in the mirror, ask yourself, who are you
If you don't know who you are, how could ya dreams come true
Muthafucka, I sat backed and watched ya, you pretended to be Pac
You pretended to be hot, but you not, now (nowww)
I see it so clear, you can't take the pressure, you pussy
I warned you not to push me
You see me, and chills, run up ya spine
God made menace in war, but ya heart ain't like mine
And plus, they look at me like I'ma menace
I was playing wit guns, while ya momma had you and yo friends playing tennis
I'ma nightmare, you see me in ya dream
Wake up, and turn on ya TV and see my ass again
You cowardly hearted, you couldn't make it on ya own
Fuck the source, I'm on the cover of rolling stone

(50 Cent (Tupac))
Till makaveli return it's all eyes on me- on me (what do we have here now)
And you can hate it or love it, but that's what it's go'n be- go'n be
Shoulda listened, I told you not to fuck wit me- wit me (what do we have here now)
Now can you take the pressure, that's what we go'n see- go'n see Till makaveli return it's all eyes on me- on me (what do we have here now)
And you can hate it or love it, but that's what it's gonna be- gonna be
Shoulda listened, I told you not to fuck wit me- wit me (what do we have here now)
Now can you take the pressure, that's what we gonna see- gonna see
California Love

California love!

California... knows how to party
California... knows how to party
In the citay of L.A.
In the citay of good ol' Watts
In the citay, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin'! We keep it rockin'!

Now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild west
A state that's untouchable like Elliot Ness
The track hits ya eardrum like a slug to ya chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state with a bomb ass hemp beat
The state where ya never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-makin-machines servin' fiends
I been in the game for ten years makin' rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearin sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin lookin' like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to tha Bay
Your city is tha bomb if your city makin' pay
Throw up a finger if ya feel the same way
Dre puttin' it down for
Californ-i-a

Shake it shake it baby
Shake it shake it baby
Shake it shake it mama
Shake it Cali
Shake it shake it baby
Shake it shake it shake it shake it...

Out on bail fresh outta jail, California dreamin'
Soon as I stepped on the scene, I'm hearin hoochies screamin
Fiendin for money and alcohol
The life of a west side playa where cowards die
Only in Cali where we riot not rally to live and die
In L.A. we wearin Chucks not Ballies (that's right)
Dressed in Locs and khaki suits and ride is what we do
Flossin but have caution we collide with other crews
Famous 'cause we program worldwide
Let'em recognize from Long Beach to Rose Grands
Bumpin and grindin like a slow jam, it's west side
So you know the row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say
But give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A.
From Oakland to Sacktown
The Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put they mack down
Give me love!

Now make it shake...

Uh, yeah, uh, longbeach in tha house, uh yeah
Oaktown, Oakland definitely in tha house hahaha
Frisko, Frisko
Hey, you know LA is up in this
Pasadina, where you at
Yeah, Ingelwood, Ingelwood always up to no good
Even Hollywood tryin' to get a piece baby
Sacramento, sacramento where ya at? yeah

Throw it up y'all, throw it up, Throw it up
Let's show these fools how we do this on that west side
Cause you and I know it's tha best side

Yeah, That's riight
West coast, west coast
Uh, California Love
California Love

So Many Tears

I shall not fear no man but God
Though I walk through the valley of death
I shed so many tears (if I should die before I wake)
Please God walk with me (grab a nigga and take me to Heaven)

Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone I grew up amongst a dyin' breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me can you feel me? I'm not livin' in the past, you wanna last
Be tha first to blast, remember Kato
No longer with us he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets
Now rest in peace
Is there heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears

Ah, I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears...
Lord, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

Now that I'm strugglin in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
And ***** the world 'cause I'm cursed, I'm havin' visions
Of leavin' here in a hearse, God can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure, and all the pain
Show me some happiness again, I'm goin' blind
I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin' well
I know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail?
My life is in denial, and when I die,
Baptized in eternal fire I'll shed so many tears

Lord, I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears...
Lord, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears
I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me
My every move is a calculated step, to bring me closer
To embrace an early death, now there's nothin' left
There was no mercy on the streets, I couldn't rest
I'm barely standin, bout to go to pieces, screamin peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin' to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin the flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just a misery
Paintin a picture of my enemies killin' me, in my sleep
Will I survive till the mo'nin, to see the sun
Please Lord forgive me for my sins, cause here I come...

Lord, I suffered through the years (God) and shed so many tears...
God, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

Lord knows I... tried, been a witness to homicide
Seen drivebys takin' lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin' high
This ain't the life for me, I wanna change
But ain't no future right for me, I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin' crazy
Disillusioned lately, I've been really wantin babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady, 'cause she's a product of this poison
I'm hearin noises, think she *****in all my boys, can't take no more
I'm fallin' to the floor; beggin for the Lord to let me in
To Heaven's door -- shed so many tears
(Dear God, please let me in)

Lord, I've lost so many years, and shed so many tears...
I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears
Lord, I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears...
God, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears
(Reporter)

Good Evening (sirens in the background)
I'm reporting live from Sunset Boulevard
Where many excited fans have gathered with candles
(Crowd starts chanting "Tupac")
Awaiting the much anticipated release, of Tupac Shakur's latest album, Better Dayz
This is yet another post-humorous release by Tupac
Which, raises the question
Where are these songs coming from?
It's interesting how, the message in these songs
Is still relevant today
Even in his death, he's touching people with his lyrics
I can feel the energy in the air, as they count down to midnight
When the album will officially be released
Oh, hold on, I, think they're starting to countdown now

(Crowd)

5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ...
(2Pac *singing in background* 2X)
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nuttin to a G

(Let's get ready to ruuumbllle!)

(2Pac *speaking over background*)
Now you know how we do it like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
That get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches

(2Pac *singing in background starts to overlap/repeat*)
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
Police bustin' at me
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
Got the police bustin' at me
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah...

(2Pac *speaking over background*)
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind nigga
My ambitions as a ridah!
My ambitions as a ridah!

(2Pac)
So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin' without heart
Was born rough and rugged, addressin the mad public
My attitude was, Fuck it, cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
Uh, and my ambitions as a ridah to catch her
While she hot, and horny, go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear, Go to the tele hoe
You put what money in a Benz, cause bitch I'm barely broke
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed feelin' crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin and prayers, to breakin motherfuckers to pay-up
I got no time for these bitches, cause these hoes tried to play us
I'm on a meal-ticket mission, want a mil', so I'm wishin
Competition got me ripped, on that bullshit they stressin (boo-yaa!)
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's manditory
No guts no glory my nigga bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the bidness so I got with Death Row
Now these money hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin and plannin on schemes, to come and trick us
But Thug niggaz be on point and game tight (yeah)
Me, Syke and Bogart, wrap it up the same night
Got problems then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggaz is jealous cause deep in they heart they wanna be me
Uh, yeah, and now ya got me right beside ya
Hopin you listen I catch you payin' attention
To my amibitions as a ridah

Chorus: 2Pac

(Singing) I won't deny it, I'ma straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
(Singing) My ambitions as a ridah
(Singing) Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nuttin to a G

(Tupac)
(I won't deny it, I'ma straight ridah)
Peep it... it was my only wish to rise
Above these jealous coward mutherfuckers I despise
When it's time to ride, I was the first off this side, give me the nine
I'm ready to die right here tonight, and motherfuck they life (yeah nigga!)
That's what they screamin as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
So open fire, I see you kill me (that's all you niggaz got?) witness my steel
Spittin' at adversaries envious and after me
I'd rather die before they catchin me, watch me bleed
Mama come rescue me I'm suicidal thinkin' thoughts
I'm innocent, so there'll be bullets flyin when I'm caught
(Shoot!) Fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrifice
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson
Thuggin' for life and if you right then nigga die for it
Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it
When it's time to die to be a man you pick the way you leave
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah


(Tupac)
My murderous lyrics equipped with spirits of the Thugs before me
Pay off the block evade the cops 'cause I know they comin' for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
Now I'm back my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds, sure as some bitches bleeds
Niggaz'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Blast me but they didn't finish, (buck buck buck buck buck)
Didn't diminish my powers
So now I'm back to be a motherfuckin menace, they cowards
That's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggaz on my team, so indeed, they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I caught the perfect way that God made it
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money, I'll have these motherfuckers buried (I been)
Gettin' much mail in jail, niggaz tellin' me to kill it
Knowin' when I get out, they gon' feel it
Witness the realest, a whoridah when I put the shit inside
The cry from all your people when they find her
Just remind ya, my history'll prove I been it
Revenge on them niggaz that played me,
And all the cowards that was down widdit
Now it's yo' nigga right beside ya
Hopin you listenin, catch you payin' attention
To my ambitions as a ridah
Unfortunately, we are not licensed to display the full lyrics for this song at the moment. Hopefully we will be able to in the future. Until then... how about a random page?
Troublesome nigga
Troublesome 19-motherfucking-96
Westside
Let it be known nigga
The boss of all bosses
Makaveli

Menacing Methods, Label me a lethal weapon
Making niggas die, witnessin' breathless imperfection
Can you picture my specific plan?
To be the man in this wicked land, underhanded hits are planned
Scams are plotted over grams and rocks
Undercover agents die by the random shots
We all die in the end, so revenge we swore
I was all about my ends fuck friends and foes
Me, a born leader, never leave the block without my heater
Got me a dog and named her mob bitch nigga eater
What could they do to me ya little brat
Shit them niggas done shot me and still terrified I'll cut they ass
How can I show you how I feel inside
We outlawz, motherfuckas can't kill my pride
Niggas talk a lot of shit but that's after I'm gone
'Cause they fear me in the physical form
Let it be known I'm troublesome

Troublesome nigga
Outlawz
We put it down to the fullest
Spitting rhymes and bullets
Troublesome
Y'all know what time it is
Call the punk police, they can't stop us
Niggas run the streets Haha...
Troublesome
Yeah

Gutter ways, my mentality is ghetto
A guerrilla in this criminal war, we all rebels
Death before dishonor, bet I bomb on them first
Niggas knew we came for murda, pullin' up in a herse
Westside was the war cry bustin' all freely
Screaming fuck all ya niggas in Swaheli
Pistol packin' fresh out of jail, I ain't goin' back
Release me to the care of my heartless trap
Say my name three times like Candyman
Bet I roll on your ass like an avalanche
A soul survivor, learned to get high and pull driveby's
Murder my foes, can't control my nine
Hearin' thoughts of my enemies pleadin' please
Busta ass motherfuckas tried to flee
Picture me lettin this chump survive
Ran up on his ass when I dump he died
'Cause I'm troublesome

Young, strapped, and I don't give a fuck
I'm hopelesssss
I live a thuglife, losing my focus baby
I'm troublesome
Badboy Killa
There is no one realler
What you saw was the rough, rugged and raw
Outlaw OUTLAW

Murder murder my mindstate shit ain't change since my last rhyme
The crime rate ain't declined
Niggas bustin' shots like they lost their mind
Like twenty-five to life never crossed their mind
Tell me young nigga never learned a thang
Dead at thirteen 'cause he yearn to bang
Sent a lot of flowers, but how can I cry
Try to warn the little nigga either stop or die
Mercy is for the weak when I speak I scream
Afraid to sleep I'm havin' crazy dreams
Vivid' pictures of my enemies and family times
God forgive me cause its wrong but I plan to die
You can take me in heaven and understand I was a sheep
Did the best I could, raised in insanity
Or send me to hell 'cause I ain't beggin' for my life
Ain't nothing worse than this cursed ass hopeless life
I'm troublesome

In your wildest dreams you couldn't picture a nigga like me
I'm troublesome I don't give a fuck
I'm troublesome
Like my nigga napolean said nigga
Somebody gotta explain why I ain't got shit
I'm troublesome
You know what time it is
The outlaw click, young rugged and sick
Makaveli the don, the boss of all bosses
Mussolini, Idi Amin, Hussein Fatal, Khadafi
Kastro, Napoleon, Mo Khomani
We ain't fucking around
We troublesome
Hey yo
We troublesome
Young Kastro, the first to blast the last one to dash
He going for the hoes and the cash
Fuck you niggas

Khadafi trump tight never sloppy
Them other fuckers try to copy
But they can't mock you nigga u 2 strong
Outlaw keep it going on
You know wassup
Outlaws outlaws
Outlaws outlaws
This is dedicated to the real niggas
All the real troublesome soldiers on the streets
That rather die than see the penitentiary
We all motherfuckin' outlaws

Bye bye
Bye bye
All you niggas die


Ah, Suge what I tell you nigga,
When I come out of jail what was I gonna do
I was gonna start diggin' into these niggas chest, right
Watch this, hey Quik let me see them binoculars, nigga
The binoculars

Grab your bulletproof vest nigga
'Cause it's gonna be a long one
Now me and Quik gonna show you niggas what it's like on this side
The real side
Now, on this ride there's gonna be some real mutha-fuckas
And there's gonna be some pussys
Now the real niggas gonna be the ones with money and bitches
The pussys are gonna be the niggas on the floor bleedin'
Now everybody keep your eyes on the prize cause the ride get tricky
See you got some niggas on your side
That say they're your friends
But in real life they your enemies
And then you got some mutha-fuckas that say they your enemies
But in real life they eyes is on your money
See the enemies will say they true
But in real life those niggas will be the snitches
It's a dirty game y'all
Y'all got ta be careful about who you fuck with and who you don't fuck with
Cause the shit get wild y'all
Keep your mind on your riches, Baby
Keep your mind on your riches

9-1-1 it's a emergency cowards tried to murder me
From hood to the 'burbs, everyone of you niggas heard of me
Shit I'm legendary niggas scary and paralyzed
Nothing more I despise than a liar
Cowards die
My mama told me When I was to see
Just a vicious mutha fucker while these devils left me free
I proceed to make them shiver
When I deliver
Criminal lyrics
From a world wide mob figure
Thug niggas from everywhere Mr. Mackaveli
Niggas is waiting for some thug shit, that's what they tell me
So many rumors but I'm infinitely Immortal Outlaw
Switching up on you ordinary bitches
Like a south paw you get let
And every breath I breathe until the moment I'm deceased
Will be another moment ballin' as a 'G'
I rip the crowd, then I start again
Internally I live in sin
Until the moment that they let me breathe again
The heartz of men


The Heartz of Men

My lyrical verse with so much pain
That to some niggas it hurts
My guns bust
And if you ain't one of us
It gets worse
Bitch niggas get their eyes swoll
In fly mode
I'm a homicidal outlaw
And five-o, get your lights on, fight long
Tonight's gonna be a fuckin' fight
So we might roll
My own homies say I'm heartless
But I'm a 'G' to this till the day I'm gone that's regardless
Drive-by, niggas bow down
Thought I'd rot in jail, paid bail, well niggas out now
Throw up your hands if you thugged out
First nigga act up
First nigga gettin' drugged out
I can be a villain if ya let me
I'll Muthafuck ya
If ya do upset me
Tell the cops to come and get me
Rip the crowd like a phone number
Then start again, don't have no muthafuckin' friends nigga
Look inside the heartz of men


In The Heartz of Men
In The Heartz of Men

To all my niggas engaged in making money in the fifty states
Keep your mind on your chips and fuck a punk bitch
No longer living in fear
My pistol close in hand
Convinced this is my year
Like I'm the chosen man
Give me my money and label me as a Don
If niggas is having problems
Smoke'em, fire and bomb
I died and came back,
I hustle with these lyrics as if it's a game of crack
Thugin' is in my spirit
I'm lost and not knowing
Scar'd up
But still flowing
Energized and still going
Uh, can it be fate
That makes a sick muthafucka break
On these jealous ass coward 'cause they evil and fake
What will it take?
Give me that bass line
I'm feeling bombed
Deathrow baby, don't be alarmed
The homie Quik gave a nigga a beat and let me start again
Represent
'Cause I've been sent
The heartz of men
(2Pac) Ah yeah
(Down) Yeauh
(2Pac) It's all about you, one time

(Down) Yeah I'm gon' say it's all about you
But you know I'm lyin' though, hah! Yeauh

(2Pac)
You probably crooked as the last trick; want it light
But how I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch
Thinkin' I had her but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck I'm stuck with fuckin' with the wrong one, uh
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin'
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin' with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin' for some love
In every club, I see you starin' like you want it
Well baby if you got it better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
I try to holla but you tell me you taken
Sayin' you ain't impressed, with the money I'm makin'
Guess it's true what they tellin' me
Fresh out of jail, life's Hell for a black, celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you widdit
Fantansies of us sweatin, can I hit it? (Hahaha)
Addicted to the things you do, but still true
What I'm sayin' Boo, is this is all about you

(Nate Dogg)
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
(Yeah nigga, ha ha ha ha!)
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe

(2Pac)
I make a promise if you go with me, just let me know
I'll have you hollerin my name out before I leave
Nobody loves me I'm a thug nigga; I only hung out
With the criminals and the drug dealers, I love niggaz
'Cause we comin' from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick, the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa, and I don't even care
Creep though, weed smoke's into the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Waitin for niggaz at the end, of every show
I just seen you in my friend's, video
Could never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin' through
It's all about you... hahaha, yeah nigga
It's all about you

(Nate Dogg)
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe

(Outlawz)
Is you sick from the dick, or is it the flu?
It ain't about you or your bitch ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty hoe
You think it's all about you? Well Boo
I gets Down like Dru and my nasty new niggaz, too

You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Golddiggin, cold diggin a gold Rolex

I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cuts, I came to fuck, try skeezin me
Runnin' up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch from the West Coast to West Virginia

(Nate Dogg)
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe

(Snoop Doggy Dogg *speaking over last two lines*)
I'm tellin' ya, it's the same ol' shit
I mean... god damn, youknowhatI'msayin?
I'm sittin' back, watchin Montell Jordan video
I see the same bitch, who was in, my homeboy Nate Dogg video
Then I flip the channel
I'm checkin' out my homeboy Tupac video
I see the same bitch that was in my video, yaknahmsayin?
And then yaknahmsayin what make that even mo' fucked up
I'm watchin a Million Man March

That was in, the homeboy Warren G video
I mean, damn, everywhere I look, everywhere I go

Don't get mad, I'm only bein real
Yeah
(What's up boo?
Swear I'll never call you bitch again
You ain't fucking with me remember I ain't hate you
I swear I'll never call you bitch again
I just wanna say that uh, I fucking apologize
I didn't mean to call you a bitch
I'll never call you bitch again

Damn


Gave my homey 90 days for domestic violence
I try to picture myself, in his position but remain silent
I get to thinking 'bout the shit we been through
We close like kin, but you remain my friend too
This life of sin, that got the both of us in trouble
But you you always stay down for a nigga so that's why I love you
Reminiscing needing tissues
Fighting over childish issues, swear I can't live with you
But without you everyday I miss you
Word on roll you hold my pistol
My gangsta bitch that you always in the mood for love
That's why I'm sleeping with you
Though not the man of your dreams, my planted schemes to be rich like a king
And live my life trouble free
I see, yesterday I called you names, and played games on your mind
I promise that I'll change in time
It's a complicated world so girl just be a friend
I swear I'll never call you bitch again

And that's my word


We came too far
To throw it all away
(I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me, ugh)
We came way too far pretty thing yeah
(I swear I'll never call you bitch again, hey)
Do it all away, do it all away baby ...


I wake up early in the morning, at the crack of dawn
Nigga still tired so I'm yawning, and now I'm gone
Tryin' to get my money on strong so an early riser
Out before them other guys, that's the way to profit every time
Can't get too close, my enemies, they see ghosts
They envy me, plus we be beefing with the east coast
Two casualties, got stopped in traffic
Had a warrant, so they gaffled me
But while I'm gone, watch my business and my back for me
My enemies think they got me crossed they ain't knowing
Ain't no love for player haters where you cowards going
You paid bail got me out of jail, home again
I promise not to leave you on your own again
Cristal corks are popped, romantic thoughts are dropped
It's so frantic but don't panic 'cause we forged to top
I found a partner and a ridah, a woman and friend
I swear I'll never call you bitch again
Believe Me


We came too far
(I know, I know)
To throw it all away
(All that is dead don't change each other)
(I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me)
We came too far pretty thing, yeah
(I know what time it is)
(You just gotta give a nigga time to grow up you know what I'm saying)
(That was way back then)
(I Swear I'll never call you bitch again, hey)
Do it all away, do it all away baby ...

You're my nigga, my best friend
I'm never gonna call u, bitch again
Yeah, yeah, yeah


Witness evil men do, all this shit I been through
Never meant to hurt you, can we make this work boo?
I know you been feeling pain, things are not the same
Waiting to exhale while I'm sitting in the country jail
Keep your head up, cause things are getting better
My cell mate shed tears off your last love letter
Told him you would find a friend so keep your eyes peeled
Sorry if I cuss, but it's the suffering that I feel
Who can I trust, and if I bust, will she snitch?
Even though your not the type to trip, sorry if I called you bitch
You showed me the definition of feminine
The difference between a pack of bitches and black women
I see the board for a third time hope to see you soon
Pictures of us kissing in the living room in the nude
Thanks for being there much more than a friend
I swear I'll never call you bitch again
Believe Me


We came too far
To throw it all away
We came way too far pretty thing yeah
(I swear I'll never call you bitch again)
Together, together

We came too far
To throw it all away
(I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me)
We came way too far pretty thing yeah
To throw it all away, throw it all away baby

Through all my ups, and downs
You always, stayed around, stayed around
How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it, yeah? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

Love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a nigga wantin' it so bad I'm 'bout to pass out
Wanna dig you and I can't even lie about it
Baby just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it

Catch you at a club, oh shit you got me fiendin'
Body talkin' shit to me but I can't comprehend the meaning
Now if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin' eighty on the freeway, police catch me if you can

Forgive me I'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame I'm a simple man
Mr. International, playa with the passport
Just like Aladdin bitch, get you anything you ask for

It's either him or me, champagne, Hennessy
A favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a hoe need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need

Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin' baby, I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy nigga now tell me how U want it

How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
I'm livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

Tell me is it cool to fuck?
Did you think I come to talk, am I a fool or what?
Positions on the floor it's like erotic, ironic
'Cause I'm some what psychotic
I'm hittin' switches on bitches like I been fixed with hydraulics

Up and down like a roller coaster, I'm up inside ya
I ain't quittin' till the show is over, 'cause I'mma rider
In and out just like a robbery, I'll probably be a freak
And let you get on top of me, get her rockin' these

Nights full of Aliz&#xE9;, a livin' legend
You ain't heard about these niggaz play these Cali days
Delores Tucker, you'se a motherfucker
Instead of tryin' to help a nigga you destroy a brother

Worse than the others, Bill Clinton, Mr. Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game is told
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Want some on lease? I'm makin' millions, niggaz top that

They wanna censor me, they'd rather see me in a cell
Livin' in hell, only a few of us'll live to tell
Now everybody talkin' 'bout us I could give a fuck
I'd be the first one to bomb and cuss, nigga tell me how U want it

How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
I'm livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

Raised as a youth, tell the truth I got the scoop
On how to get a bulletproof because I jumped from the roof
Before I was a teenager, mobile phone, Sky Pager
Game rules, I'm livin' major, my adversaries

Is lookin' worried, they paranoid of gettin' buried
One of us gon' see the cemetery
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin' high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die

I wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million
And then I'm chillin' fade 'em all
These taxes got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me
Media is in my business and they actin' like they know me

Ha ha ha, but I'mma mash out, peel out
I'm with it quick I'se quick to whip that fuckin' steel out
Yeah nigga it's some new shit so better get up on it
When ya see me tell a nigga how ya want it, how do U want it?

How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game

Youse a cold ass nigga on them hogs

(Snoop)
Sho nuff, I keep my hand on my gun
'Cause they got me on the run
Now I'm back in the courtroom waitin on the outcome
Free Tupac, is all that's on a niggaz mind

So I'ma get smart, and get defensive and shit
And put together a million march, for some gangsta shit

(2Pac)
So now they got us laced
Two multimillionare motherfuckers catchin cases (mmm)
Bitches get ready for the throwdown
The shit's about to go down
Uh, me and Snoop about to clown

You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin'
Niggaz be actin' like they savage, they out to get the cabbage
I got, nothin' but love, for my niggaz livin' lavish

(Snoop)
I got a pit named P, she niggarino
I got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
And I, think I got a black Beamer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Seagel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up, by the little homie in the Regal
Mmm, it feel good to you baby bubba
Ya see, this is for the G's and the keys motherfucker

(2Pac)
Now follow as we riiiiide
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the West side
And I can make you famous
Niggaz been dyin' for years, so how could they blame us

Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
And keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, suffering is grief
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck wit me
I bust and flea, these niggaz must be crazy what?
There ain't no mercy motherfuckers who can fade the Thugs
(Hahah right) You thought it was but it wasn't, now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player

(Snoop)
It's like 'cause, blood, gangbangin
Everybody in the party doin' dope slangin
You got to have papers in this world
You might get your first snatch, before your eyes swerl
Ya doing ya job, every day
And then you work so hard till ya hair turn gray
Let me tell you about life, and 'bout the way it is
You see we live by the gun, so we die by the gun's kids

(2Pac)
They tell me not to roll with my glock
So now I gotta throw away
Floatin in the black Benz, tryin' to do a show a day
They wonder how I live, with five shots
Niggaz is hard to kill, on my block
Schemes for currency and doe related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm tryin' to get up on it
My nigga Dogg with me, eternally the most wanted

Chorus (w/ variations to end)
California love

California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A.
In the city of good old Watts
In the city, city of Compton
We keep it rockin'
We keep it rockin'

Dr. Dre
Now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild west
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your jimmy in the city of sex

We in that sunshine state with a bomb-ass hemp beat
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean, mean, money-making machines serving fiends

I been in the game for ten years making rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearing Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shining, looking like I robbed Liberace

It's all good from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city making pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way
Dre putting it down for Californ-I-A

California (California) knows how to party (knows how to party)
California (West Coast) knows how to party (yes they do, that's right)
In the city of L.A. (city of L.A.)
In the city of good old Watts (good old Watts)
In the city, city of Compton (city of Compton, yeah)
We keep it rockin' (keep it rockin')
We keep it rockin'

My niggas say, come on
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, mama
Shake it, Cali (shake it, Cali)
Shake it, shake it, baby (that's right)
Shake it, shake it, baby, baby
Shake it, shake it, mama
Shake it, Cali

2Pac
Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreaming
Soon as I step on the scene I'm hearing hoochies screamin'
Fiending for money and alcohol
The life of a Westside player, where cowards die
And it's all war

Only in Cali where we riot, not rally to live and die
In L.A. we wearing Chucks, not Ballies (that's right)
Dressed in Locs and khaki suits and ride is what we do
Flossing but have caution; we collide with other crews

Famous 'cause we program worldwide
Let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumping and grinding like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know The Row won't bow down to no man

Say what you say
But give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A.
From Oakland to Sac-Town
The Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put they mack down
Give me love

California (California) knows how to party
Really knows how to
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A. (South Central)
In the city of good old Watts (that's right)
In the city, city of Compton
We keep it rockin'
We keep it rockin'

(Yeah, yeah, now make it shake, c'mon)
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, mama
Shake it, Cali (shake it, Cali)
Shake it, shake it, baby (shake it, Cali)
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, mama (West Coast)
Shake it Cali

Yeah, oh

Yeah, Long Beach in the house, aww yeah
Oaktown, Oakland definitely in the house
'Frisco, 'Frisco
Hey, you know L.A. up in this
Pasadena, where you at?
Yeah, Inglewood, Inglewood always up to no good
Even Hollywood trying to get a piece, baby
Sacramento, Sacramento, where you at? Yeah
Throw it up, y'all, throw it up, throw it up, I can't see you

Everywhere I see, a Soldier a Soldier.
Everywhere I see, a Soldier Like Me.

(Verse 1: 2Pac)
Posse deep as I role through the streets
Muthafuck the police as we creep in our Jeeps
Layin' so long you think I'm asleep
But at the slightest beat, I'm robbin' niggas through the teeth
And OPD can get the dick if they play tuffy
Last time them niggas rushed me, I ain't bust but now I'm touchy
Trust me, ain't nothin' jumpin' but these buck shots
Them niggas got enough knots, I'm poppin' corrupt cops
You muthafuckers catch a hot one
You wanted to start a problem, now you coward cops have got one
And there's no prison that can hold a
Muthafuckin' Soldier, ready to role and take control
So now I jack 'em while they sleepin'
Role to the door, through a grenade in the precinct
Some people panic, brothers bugged out
I had to keep poppin' 'cause wouldn't stop until they rugged out
And they vest don't protect from the head wounds
Reload ammunition's & them bitches will be dead soon
Smoke risin' from the barrel of my shotty
I finally got revenge, now count the bodies
20 cops, one for every year in jail
Tryin' to keep a nigga down, but you failed
Before I let you take me, I told ya
Fuck bein' trapped, I'm a Soldier.

I betcha that I got something you ain't got, that's called courage
It don't come from no liquor bottle, it ain't scotch, it's not bourbon
I don't walk around like no G 'cause that ain't me, I'm not that person
I don't try to act like you do 'cause that ain't you, you just frontin'.
You ain't?

(Verse 2: 2Pac)
It's 2Pac in the mad bitch
In them .64 rag on them things, that's a bad bitch
Gettin' ghosts on them bitches in the town
Bustin' out the backseat, nigga when we clown.
Homey is you down?
B got the strap and she anxious
Hurry up 'fo she spank shit
Comin' round the corners, spittin' rounds
They payin' homey down
Caught them sucker ass bitches outta bounce.
Now tell me how that sound?
A double date laced with hate, make 'em pray for the judgement day.
Now tell me how that sound?
A double date laced with hate, make 'em pray for the judgement day.
Stinkin' biatch!

I betcha that I got something you ain't got, that's called courage
It don't come from no liquor bottle, it ain't scotch, it's not bourbon
I don't walk around like no G 'cause that ain't me, I'm not that person
I don't try to act like you do 'cause that ain't you, you just frontin'.
You ain't? (2Pac)

I wanted to bring back that reality, nobody can ever be confused and think I'm fuckin' Mike Tyson
And I'm the heavyweight champion, I'm a little nigga, that's why it's so raw to just watch me
Battle lions, 'cause I'm a little skinny nigga battlin' niggas three times my size

Watch this uppercut, here it comes... watch the jab nigga... ugh... here it come, look out, watch
My arms...

(Verse 1: 2Pac)
Now see so many motherfuckers wanna take a piece
Commin' equipped with some shit that niggas just can't believe
I pull a trick from my sleeve now kamikazee
I'm all over that nigga, come identify the body
My middle finger to you hoe niggas
Run up on me, and I'll be forced to let it go nigga
I ain't the one you wanna try, why, stayin' high
I hit this blunt and watch these motherfuckers die
Whose runnin' these streets I said that cocaine
Cause in the the dope game, niggas'll die 'fore they go broke mayne
Another hustler makin' major cash
Till the punk police come an raid ya ass
Now you stressed doin' fed time, and it's a bitch
Cause the judge gave you 8 years, you doin' 6
And we know that you can't hang, you a trick
Rolled over turned snitch like a biatchhhh

(Chorus (x1): 2Pac)
Now you know you shoulda ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin' from the uppercut, fucked, so what's up? nigga!
Now you know you shoulda ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin' from this uppercut, stuck, so what's up? nigga!

(Verse 2: 2Pac)
They got a nigga in the dice game, I'm feelin' lucky
But the nigga just a little bigger, he tryin' fuck me
Out my cash, imma blast nigga, he don't know
I gotta tell ya like the last nigga, gotta go
Don't need to roll for the truck, I get em' up
Left to right, my uppercut'll hit em' up (ha)
I'm known to walk the streets on any block
I love my niggas, but I ain't puttin' down my glock
The gun shots rang when I lose nigga, and ooh nigga
Imma show you not to ever play a true nigga (haha)
Lay it down just to prove it
And fuck the rappin' motherfucker we can do this

(Chorus (x1): 2Pac)
Now you know you shoulda ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin' from the uppercut, fucked, so what's up? nigga!
Now you know you shoulda ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin' from this uppercut, stuck, so what's up? nigga!

(Verse 3: Outlawz (EDI and Young Noble)
They claim that we violent, we named after tyrants
This revolution won't be televised, we keep it silent (shh)
Roll on our enemies, beat em' at they own game
Molotov cocktails, release an up in flames
Tired of bein' stepped on, sick of bein' held back
Lookin' through my rear view, thinkin' 'bout the pay back
Wanna see my kids grow don't know if imma make it though
One more nigga came up short in the ghetto
Society lied to me so I'm strapped with the metal
Push ya middle finger up nigga if you a rebel
Have ya face down goin' in ya pockets if ya let em'
I done lost too many homies for me to ever forget em'
I done made so many mistakes but still I don't regret em'
I'm a product of the pimp, the pusher, and the reverend
I'm a product of the block, the fiends, and the felons
We all lost souls tryina find our way to heaven

(Chorus (x1): 2Pac)
Now you know you shoulda ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin' from the uppercut, fucked, so what's up? nigga!
Now you know you shoulda ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin' from this uppercut, stuck, so what's up? nigga!

(Outro: Edi Talking)
To all the conrads no longer with us, see you when we get there
'Pac, Yak, we gon' keep on ridin', give these cowards the uppercut
Till we get up there with y'all, YOU KNOW!..
Thug Life we still livin' it
Outlaw for life, in the name of the Don, let's go!
(Intro: Tupac Talking)
Oh, I posted bail?
I'm out this motherfucker?
I can go?
Oh, fuck y'all eh, fuck the judge
Fuck the motherfuckin' district attourney and the prosecutor (fuck you!)
And fuck you motherfuckers in the jury box (fuck you!)
Fuck all y'all
'Cause I'm out on motherfuckin' bail
Y'all ain't never gonna see me in this motherfucker again
Drop that shit em!
Let these old punk ass bitches know how we runnin' this shit
Niggaz ain't going back to court you stank ass bitches

(Verse 1: 2Pac)
I'm stuck in jail the DA's tryin' to burn me
I'd be out on bail if I had a good attorney
Wanna label me a criminal and cuff me up
Got a pocket full of money so they rough me up
I ain't trippin' in the county and I'm mad as fuck
Got a record so they put me with the baddest bunch
Everybody wanna talk 'cause I'm rappin'
They askin' me what happened
Is it true you did a flick with Janet Jackson
I can't sleep they takin' polaroids
And I'm tryna to use the phone but they makin' noise
Man I wish I had my glock cause its major
I'm makin' shanks out the plastics in razors
These motherfuckers won't leave me alone that's my word
Bout to turn a violation to a motherfuckin' murder
I'm makin' collect calls to my old bitches
Send mo' pictures and make me some more riches
To all the suckers on the block talkin' shit while I was locked up
Be prepared to get socked up
Cause the game is deep and the fame is brief
And you bullshittin' bitches ain't changin' me
I came straight up out the gutta I was saved from hell
I'm a thug I was raised in jail
Now I'm out on bail

Out on Bail (You know what fuckin' time it is)
ThugLife will never fail (I'm out on bail)
Thuglife niggaz (I'm going straight to 50,000 BIATCH!)
Thuglife niggaz (I'm out on bail)
Out on Bail (Hey, hand me some motherfuckin' Colt 40's from the fridge nigga)
ThugLife will never fail ('Cause I'm out on bail)
Thuglife niggaz (Hey, pass me my motherfuckin' Rolex)
Thuglife niggaz (Yes bitch that's a President)

(Verse 2: 2Pac)
Stuck in jail and mad as a bitch
I'd be out on bail if it wasn't for the snitch
Runnin' wild through the streets like I'm loco
And fuck the punk police and they chokeholds
I got no love in my heart 'cause I'm heartless
Mobbin' in the park after dark wanna start shit
Rippin' up the scene as a teen I was at it (but hey)
And sellin' products to the addicts 'cause they gotta have it
I was a well-known thug and I gotta lotta love
Hangin' out with the OG's shootin' up the clubs
And mama told me don't hang with the homies
But they got me if they need me then it's on G
Got me sittin' in the cell a five by seven
Will I finally get to go to ghetto heaven
Got my bitches on the outside writin' me letters
And they tell me they love me and the shit ull get better
I don't believe her 'cause I just got the news on the wire
Take it how you want it but your bitch is on fire
I gotta be a player so I stay strong
'Cause I know that I won't be away long
And when I finally do hit the fuckin' streets I'ma handle this
A thug nigga gettin' scandalous
I'm on bail

Out on Bail
ThugLife (see) will never fail (Out on bail - biatch!)
Thuglife niggaz (You know what time it is)
Thuglife niggaz (I'm out on bail)
Out on Bail (Y'all don't need to know about...)
ThugLife will never fail (You know, Out on bail)
Thuglife niggaz (Y'all Blow that shit - Get me up out this)
Thuglife niggaz (Yo, EM! Get me up out of this motherfucker man!)
Out on Bail (These motherfuckers are harassing me and that ain't cool)

(Outro: Tupac Talking)
Out on bail
I'll see ya motherfuckers at the next show, 2pac, the media is my bitch
It's that famous shit, you know?
Real thug shit
Real live thug shit, genuine, you know what I'm sayin'
I wouldn't waste your motherfuckin' time with no bullshit baby
Trust me, It's that real shit
I'm talkin' about that shit you never tell your grandkids about, you know?
I ran with a thug nigga, believe that
This my motherfuckin' nigga Em on dem motherfuckin' boards in case your wonderin'
We doin' this shit hell motherfuckin' yeah
An ounze of that shit sittin' in your motherfuckin' lac
Now press rewind nigga!
Hit them with a lil' ghetto gospel

(Chorus - Elton John:)
Those who wish to follow me (My ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior without the sound of guns

(2Pac)
If I could recollect before my hood days
I'd sit and reminisce, Thinkin' of bliss and the good days
I stop and stare at the younger, my heart goes to'em
They tested, it was stressed that they under
In our days, things changed
Everyone's ashamed to the youth 'cause the truth looks strange
And for me it's reversed, we left them a world that's cursed, and it hurts
Cause any day they'll push the button
And all good men like Malcolm X and Bobby Hunton, died for nothin'
Don't them let me get teary, the world looks dreary
But when you wipe your eyes, see it clearly
There's no need for you to fear me
If you take the time to hear me, maybe you can learn to cheer me
It ain't about black or white, 'cause we're human
I hope we see the light before its ruined
My ghetto gospel

(Chorus - Elton John:)
Those who wish to follow me (My ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior without the sound of guns

(2Pac)
Tell me do you see that old lady ain't it sad
Living out a bag, but she's glad for the little things she has
And over there there's a lady, crack got her crazy
Guess she's given birth to a baby
I don't trip and let it fade me, from outta the frying pan
We jump into another form of slavery
Even now I get discouraged
Wonder if they take it all back while I still keep the courage
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottle
I make mistakes, but learn from every one
And when its said and done
I bet this Brotha be a better one
If I'm upset, you don't stress
Never forget, that God hasn't finished with me yet
I feel his hand on my brain
When I write rhymes, I go blind, and let the Lord do his thang
But am I less holy
'Cause I choose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace in that war on the streets
My ghetto gospel

(Chorus - Elton John:)
Those who wish to follow me (Yeah My ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior without the sound of guns

(2Pac)
Lord can you hear me speak!
To pay the price of being hell bound...
(Intro: 2Pac)

Black Cotton
Black Cotton
Black Cotton - A symbol for unrewarded struggle
Time for a little gospel tail
Ghetto gospel that is- listen
Robbin' Black Cotton in God's eyes
Speak


Black Cotton
Steady stressin' Smith and Wessons count my blessin's
Class is in session the worst question is the first question
Why do we work like slaves sweatin' blades to an early grave
Never got paid but still we slave (In the nine tre')
Answer that then answer this too-
Loves gonna get ya you know it's true life's a bitch true
You best to backtrack and try to act black and live
Not to be phony and positive but why be negative?
What's the matter G? Black cat got your tongue
Fat track gotcha sprung now your hung (Do ya feel me?)
Dum dum diddy is it me?
Attempt to reach each and every brother on the streets
If not peace then at least let's get a piece
I'm tired of seeing bodies on the streets- deceased
Lookin' through my highschool yearbook
Reminiscin' of the tears as the years took
One homie, two homie, three homies - POOF
We used to have troops but now there's no more youth to shoot
God come save the misbegotten
Lost ghetto souls of Black Cotton (In God's eyes)

(Chorus: Eminem)

Nobody don't care
(No matter how hard I try/Look to the sky/and I ask God why)
Nobody don't care
(Seems like my dreams/Drowned in by screams/No answer to my questions)
Nobody don't care
(Feels like I'm pressed/Why do I stress?/It's like I'm being tested)
Nobody don't care
(Seems like my prayers/Vanish to thin air/Please answer my questions)
Nobody don't care


In the belly of the beast I'm bubbling up
Running out of luck, about to self destruct
Old heads say live your life like such
Your sure to catch her witcha one day boy
I wouldn't listen to 'em
Your power movement was cool
But it ain't fix nothin'
So I just go with what I know
I don't trust none
Look what the 80's did
To what's Bebe's kids
And now we grown up
Nobody ain't own us yet


Black cotton, I'm plottin' on what they owe me
I'm workin' without a profit
They shacklin' all my homies
I'm hurtin' but keep the mind
And we ain't stop, its cutains, you try to rise and
Certainly we survive with Outlaw Ridas
What's the reward for a strugala
If the lord lovin' us then why they hate to see us comin' up
Runnin' up, Gun cocked like nasty gloves
If you ain't got a penny, mind the glove
No love
Waitin' for my 40 acas and a blunt to blaze
Biblicle times good hearts with milita minds
Black Cotton - I'm hoppin' over enemy lines
Black Cotton - I ain't stoppin' till they givin' me mine
Black Cotton
(2Pac)
Now I've got to ask, on a nigga's ass, tell me will they blast me?
I think of an alias in case these crooked bitches ask me
Now, it's gettin' crazy after dark, these narcs
Be like tryin' to shut me down but I'm too smart
Now picture me scared of the penitentiary
I've been movin these things since the days of elementary
Now tell me what you need when you see me
I'm stackin G's, buyin all the things on TV, believe me
I got some killas on my payroll, and they know
When it's time to handle business, nigga lay low
Although I'm young, I'm still comin' up
I'm gettin' paid, pullin raises on niggas when they runnin' up
The first to pull a strap when there's drama
Busta, you ain't heard?
I've been slicin motherfuckerss since I lost my momma
There ain't a cop that can stop me
My posse is cocked, G, and they don't quit until they drop me
I'm loyal to the game


(Treach)
Without no doubt I ain't no slouch and it ain't time to back down
So I jumps in and try to stop-a and watch-a
Slap you cock-eyed like Popeye fucks spinach
Forgotten more shit than most crews ever know, or ever knew
Was born with 7 flows and only heaven knew
For beat the boot sex, the news breaks, the you shakes
Worse, they heard we got more nerve than a 2-fake
Yoo-hoo to you crew and you too so you knew
I'm from Jersey and I'm a teen so your block more than you do
Whose the new crew?
Show me your neck brotha, and here's another
Smack your mother's mamma's mother
In the first mob of all those other crack lovers
Back was bitch-ass, trick ass, cluk-clow-cluk-clow
How ya like me then, how ya like me, hey-ho, how ya like me now?
Ow, pow, hurt, don't it? Bow, bow, don't run up on it
The same thing minus P hangin' possies like an exponent
Oh yes, rock in slums, ya gots to run it
It makes no sense to smell like shit
If old ass George could be Washing-tons


(Riddler)
Now I be loyal to my niggas on the blocks, just buckin the shots
And packin the glocks
And dodgin the cops, and takin' over niggas spots
Poppin' after poppin' the fools be droppin', the hoes be hoppin
On my thing cause it hangs like the nets from Above the Rim
You lookin' grim, is it me or him or him
Or be with me, we be together
So what's up? We can do whatever
Cause real niggas stick together
Till they make it up to heaven
Through the stress, through the hell, through the 1-8-7
The shorter the nigga, the bigga the trigga
The deeper they dig the ditch-a
The Naughty the Treach
Then through to the Pac I brings the glock I wets up
You fuckin' body, I'm like, Oh my Gody
Did I really shoot him? Yo I shot him
So got him, now I puts the crime behind me
And finds me, a place to lays my head low
I lives doin' my rap, but I dies for my hood row
So all you fuckin' fools better recognize, and know my fuckin' name
I be Riddler to my niggas and I'm loyal to the game
(Verse 1: 2Pac)
See, it ain't easy bein' me
Life as a celebrity is less than heavenly
I got these fakes and these back-stabbers chasin' me around
And it's always drama
Whevever I wanna get around
Mama told me
Long before I ever came up
Gotta be true, to watchya' do
And keep ya' game up
'Cause things change
And jealousy becomes a factor
Best friends at your wifes house tryin' to mack her!
I'm on tour
But still they keep on knockin' at my door
And I got no time to worry
I'm steady wantin' more
Every day is a test, yes
I try hard
But I'm strugg-a-lin' with every breath
I pray to God that the woman that I left at home
All alone
Ain't nothin' like tryin' to bone
Over the phone
In my mind
I can see her naked
I can't take it
Got me shakin' at the thought that we can make it
I thought you knew.

(Chorus: Nate Dogg)
I'm rollin' out on tour today you gettin' sad 'cause I'm goin' away, Naa
Chickenheads wanna play with me you gettin' mad cause you think I'm a sway,
Some of them cute some of them fine as fuck I hear them scream soon as I hit the stage, Naa
Still I be gettin' lonely for you I'm comin' home as soon as I make this pay. (echoes)

(Verse 2: 2Pac)
I call you up long distance
On the telephone
I wanna tuck you in
Even though I know I can't make it home
I whisper things in your' ear
Like your near me
Wonder if you feel me
From far away
Or can you hear me
It seems to me
That your' jealous
'Cause I'm hustlin' and makin' money
With the fellas'
In the back streets
Tryin' to trap me
Baby hold up
Thugs get lonely too!
But I'm a soulja
And there's no way I'm a' stop makin' money
'Cause your' attitudes changed
And your' actin' a little funny
Always complainin'
Sayin' we don't spend time
Can't you see
I got enough stress on my mind
And hangin' up like you all that
And get mad when I'm tell you that
"I'm busy baby call back"
Please, ain't nothin' left to say to you
Thugs get lonely too
You know.

(Chorus: Nate Dogg)
I'm rollin' out on tour today you gettin' sad 'cause I'm goin' away, Naa
Chickenheads wanna play with me you gettin' mad cause you think I'm a sway,
Some of them cute some of them fine as fuck I hear them scream soon as I hit the stage, Naa
Still I be gettin' lonely for you I'm comin' home as soon as I make this pay. (echoes)

(Verse 3: 2Pac)
I sit alone in my room, drinkin'
Without a care
Talkin' out loud to you'
Like your' there
Take your' picture out my back pocket
Man it's on
You the first face I wanna see
When I get home
I wanna love you till the sun rise
Buckwild
Touchin' every wall in the house
Thug style
Put your' hands on the headboard
Think of me
Drippin' sweat on top of you
Sick of scenes in yo' head
That I'm makin' love
So turn the lights down
Reminice 'n' relax
'Cause baby right now
I feel in the middle of my stomach
You whisper in my ear
Baby tell me how you really want it
Hold on tightly
Watch the ceiling
Scratch my back
How you react
Lets me know you feel me
'Cause everything I'm givin' to you
Is so true
Thugs get lonely too
You know.

(Chorus: Nate Dogg)
I'm rollin' out on tour today you gettin' sad 'cause I'm goin' away, Naa
Chickenheads wanna play with me you gettin' mad cause you think I'm a sway,
Some of them cute some of them fine as fuck I hear them scream soon as I hit the stage, Naa
Still I be gettin' lonely for you I'm comin' home as soon as I make this pay. (echoes)

(Outro: Tupac Talking)
Yeah! Thug Life Baby
(Intro) (2Pac)
Niggas! (Yeah!) (Uh)
Niggas!

(Verse: 2Pac)
Who's afraid of the punk police?
Niggas run the streets, no justice no peace
Fuck the law, rather draw than do time
Don't fuck with mine, cross the line, my two nines
Go baya baya when I shoot 'em
Korean mothafuckers was crooked, so niggas had to burn and loot 'em
Now the streets ain't safe at night
My Niggas! Straight take his life
So don't sleep when my Jeep creep up, how we hit 'em
Empty the clip, then dip 'cause we did 'em
Lickin' of shots for Latasha that's proper
Love for my niggas but a glock for the coppers
So what the fuck you wanna do now
I packed a .9 last year, in '99 I'm packin' 2 now
And even if they pull their triggers
They can shoot one man, but nothings gonna stop the plan of true niggas

(Chorus (2Pac)
Niggas! (Yeah niggas, you can't fuck with us)
Niggas! ('Cause bein' a nigga means you love niggas)
Niggas!
(Jada!, ey yo)

(Verse: Jadakiss)
My dimes make the fiends go to sleep, so they call 'em bedrocks
Niggas is like photographers, all they take is head shots
Your last words'll be, "damn what's all these red dots?"
Niggas nowawadays, they worry me, my bars is therapy
As long as you usin' them thouroughly, muah till the day that they bury me
My niggas is stronger and tighter now than they probably will ever be
And I'm a product of the '70's
The hood got niggas on punishment, that's why they never leave
If I ain't eatin' with you, I'm probably beefin' with you
If no money ain't involved ain't no need for me speakin' with you
I know you got a gun but I'm hopin' you keep it with you
'Cause unfortunately, I'm one of them rappers that keep a pistol and
You know what the llama do, Shady/Aftermath, Ruff Ryders, D-Block, and of course Amaru
Lotta people honor you, probably 'cause of the way you used to bring the drama to
Whoever you wanted to, you a leader when you can get a leader to follow you
But anyway, life goes on, so I'll see you when I art in heaven like our fathers do

(Chorus (2Pac)
Niggas! (Yeah niggas, you can't fuck with us)
Niggas! (Yeah niggas, 'cause bein' a nigga means you love niggas)
Niggas!
Niggas! (Nigga!, you can't fuck with us)

Yeah nigga
Yo Pac (That's right)
Yo, I heard you got beat up by the police
Got a big fat lawsuit and everything (yeah)
Niggaz just wanna know if your still gonna be on some crooked ass nigga shit

(2pac Verse 1)
Please tell me what's a nigga to do and it's true
Ain't nuttin' new so I do what I can to get through
Now first they had me trapped and now I'm pissed
A loaded AK47 layin on my hips so don't trip
One motherfucker from the underground
And Big Stretch buckin' niggaz if they fuck around
Yo, why y'all got beef with police?
Ain't that a bitch them motherfuckers gotta beef with me
They make it hard for me to sleep
I wake up at the slightest peep and my sheets are 3 feet deep
I guess it's hard for you to see
But now I'm pointin the finger at police instead of motherfuckers blamin' me
I got the right to bear a pistol
And when them punk motherfuckers get to trippin' I got shit too
And maybe then you'll see the truth
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too

It's all up to you
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth (awwwwww)
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
It's all up to you
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth (awwwwww) Ooh!
You can't fuck with the crew, a crooked nigga too

(2pac Verse 2)
You know you really can't say that you blame niggaz
Fuck bein' tame, set a flame, tryin' to aim triggaz
2pac'll spark a revolution, fuck the constitution
I want my bucks for restitution
This time you got a bigger problem
Time to face the niggas from South Central, Oakland, Brooklyn and Harlem
And we ain't shootin' at eachother (fuck no), that's a motherfuckin' brother
So save two, run for cover
And other bitches from the clan
Come feel the wrath of a black man that doesn't smoke crack and
I don't drink St. Ides (fuck that!)
Genuine draft ganja ganja and my fuckin' Tec-9
They know their scared to see us sober (awwwww)
Cobra - And niggaz will take the world over
It's all up to you (up to you) Blame the Korean (fuck that)
I'll be a crooked nigga too

It's all up to you
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth (awwwwww)
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
It's all up to you
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth (awwwwww) Ooh!
You can't fuck with the crew, a crooked nigga too

(2pac Verse 3)
Pardon me, ?? has been God and try me
I'll be damned if I die come look at the rage in my eyes G
They got my homies in a jail cell
Now it's the rebel and the devil and one of us is goin' to hell
I got the whole place covered with loc'ed out brothers
And nothing but love for eachother
So motherfucker make a motion
I give a fuck, slice you up, and throw your ass in the ocean
Temperatures drop
See it's cool to shoot a nigga but they hate it when we pop the cops
That's when they gettin' petrol
You better watch your step or you'll be left on deathrow
But I learned to look ahead of me
Stay strapped, watch your back, keep your eyes on the enemy
We blowin' up precincts and ooh you can't fuck with the crew
A crooked nigga too

It's all up to you
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth (awwwwww)
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
It's all up to you
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth (awwwwww) Ooh!
You can't fuck with the crew, a crooked nigga too
I ain't got time for this man I'm out

You should stop for awhile you will find me standing by (Don't you trust me?)
Over here at the side of your life (Not that I don't trust you)
You spend all your hours just rushing around
Do you have a little time to have a little time for me?

As soon as I leave the house you wanna page me
See you got me trapped I'm going crazy this is slavery
You act like it's outrageous give me space it won't get better
And maybe we will argue and be through with all these sorry letters
Soon as I come home it's like I get the third degree
Where ya been and who you with I get no room to breathe
It makes me wanna leave
I'm sick of these tricks up your sleeve
Your suspicious I deceive give me grief without belief but to me
If you really trust me then it's pitiful
Question me about my whereabouts that's so trivial
Let me live my life and you can live yours
Just be there to help me and support that's what your here for
Not to give me stress and add to pressure
Home is where I go the rest I go to pass the test
I'm sorry if I left you all alone
But I couldn't make it home so we argue on the phone
Don't you trust me?


Callin' up my house to hang it up You think that makes sense
Tell me what it takes for us to shake so we can be friends
It's time for us to take our separate paths
We had a lot of laughs but the good things come to pass
Let's make it an even break don't make it scandalous
Try to be mature I'm pretty sure that we can handle this
You're saying I'm too busy I ignore you
I guess you didn't hear me when I said that I cared for you
But now it seems the arguments are nightly
I wanna hold you tightly but instead you wanna fight me
So why let it stress and aggravate me
Instead I'd rather break hope you don't hate me
You tell me that you love me but your lyin'
Fighting back the urge to start cryin'
I wipe away your tears come and hug me
I love you like you love me
Girl... don't you trust me?


I hangup the phone (click)
I can't bare to hear you yellin' at me
Maybe we should end it neither one of us are happy
You know that I'm emotional you milk me
Comin' over crying just to get me feelin' guilty
You and me were met to be it yet
You always wanna sweat and how much closer can we get (don't fret)
Just let me pack my things and I'll be outie
This time I'm breaking out you let your mouth overcrowd me
I can't take the beefin' and the griefin'
I get no room to sleep I hope it ceases 'cause I'm leavin'
Maybe next time you'll be a little more sure
When I can give you more when you unsure
But baby until then I gotta leave ya
It's not that I don't need ya but see ya
And I hope that you understand why I bust it
Not because we rushed it (hell no)
But girl don't you trust me?


Not that I don't trust you
Don't you trust me?

Not that I don't trust you
Don't you trust me?

Not that I don't trust you
(Obie Trice)
Ha ha, yeah

(Tupac)
Nigga fuck that Gin and Juice (Hennessy)

Just Pour a nigga a glass

Hennessy, that dark shit (That's right)

Big ballin ass nigga named Pac

(Verse 1: Tupac)
Now I was born in the gutter facing life or death
I was a thug ever since my momma gave me breath
These motherfuckaz wanna see me die
So who am I to try to warn 'em, I'll buck and bomb 'em, them niggas fry
Hey remember me? Down that Hennessy
The nigga you don't wanna see, let me proceed
My definition of some thug shit, y'all don't hear me?
Now that it's poppin' ain't no love bitch
I maintain in the game, in the gutter is where I still kick it
I'm tryin' to hustle up a meal ticket
I'm still wicked in my ways, a hustler till my dying days
Ain't nothin' wrong with gettin' paid
So nigga blaze, 'cause we some motherfuckin fools
Walkin' through the streets wearing jewels
Breakin niggaz, fakin moves
Even the cops can't stop us
My enemies flip when the see me drink a fifth of that Hennessy

(Chorus: Tupac/Obie Trice)
They wanna know who's my role model
It's in the brown bottle (Yo what's our motherfucking motto nigga?)
Hennessy

They wanna know who's my role model
It's in the brown bottle (You know our motherfucking motto)
Hennessy

Ha ha ha, Y'all niggaz can't fuck with this whole thug shit (Hennessy)

(Obie Trice)
That's what I'm sippin on
Now let me tell 'em who I be

(Tupac)
Big ballin ass nigga named Trice

(Verse 2: Obie Trice)
Now I was born in Detroit on the side that's west
Troubled child, commin up I had to ride I guess
Tried to apply myself, but niggas was ballin
My momma couldn't tell me shit, the streets was callin
I was often involved with niggaz breakin the law
I look back Pac nigga, we was bankin off raw
P Funk, got it pumpin, he had the connects
Through the sack to us little niggaz workin the set
And if you got it you getting wet, nigga bet on that
Don't come around hurr on that floss shit
Detroit niggaz off shit
(Robbin niggaz in the door ways) That's right
(With my 4-4, that's the sure way)
And this your old days, all eyez on me
We was loony I suppose you could (die homie)
O Trice always repped his block
(2pac)
Thug for life nigga
Can't you read the signs?
Ay fuck it man

(Whatchu doin'?) Mobbin' like a motherfucker stuck
Can you put your middle finger out the window gettin' fucked off - liquor
Get loaded can't control it
Nigga pass me the blunt and let me roll it
You get the bones act to the whole stack
That's fo sho black
To be a mack and keep your dough fat
And tell me what does it take to be a G?
I started with a quarter ounce and bounced to a key
You gotta watch your back stay strapped, be alert
Started as a young muthafucka doin' dirt
And now I'm in the rap game like the crack game
I got enemies
Can't pretend to see my friends are not my enemies
And even thug muthafuckas wanna have fun
Stuck it, buckin' my muthafuckin magnum
What does it take to be a G?
Silence is a must, violence is a plus
Plus, shots at my adversaries
Dem niggaz scary best it's time to be buried
'Cause I'll be buckin' in a fuckin' hurry


Tell em'
Thug for life
High till I die
When em' stupid ass bitches ask why?

2pac

Game? Thicker than most of these tricks
I got my mind on makin' money,
But you stuck on these fake bitches
And jealous muthafuckas can't see
That it's the fame that caught these stupid bitches, pass the pussy free
So tell me why you sweatin' a muthafucka like me?
A young nigga tryin' to a hustle up some G's
You pussy ass playa hatin' hoes speakin' down on niggas
Jumpin' around at the shows
And your the first muthafucka to jump
To the trunk when it's time for fun
Little trick ass punk
Thug muthafuckas don't die we get high and we multiply
Muthafuckaa!
Give a holla to my niggas in the Bay
I'm livin' in LA still clutchin' on my AK


Tell em'
Thug for life
High till I die
When em' stupid ass bitches ask why?

Thug for life biatch!

Yeah nigga, thug life, from now till the muthafuckin' ever
Havenotz in this muthafucka

(Hook (Tupac)

Why'd you sland crack? I had to
Why'd you sland crack? 'Cause I had to
Why'd you sland crack? 'Cause I had to
A nigga gotta pay the fuckin' bills

(Verse 1 (Tupac)

Crazy, I gotta look at what you gave me, claimin I'ma criminal when you the one that made me
They got me trapped in this slavery
Now I'm lost in the holocaust headin for my grave G
I told Sam he could fuck the war, and got a busted jaw for sayin' "fuck the law"
And if you wonder why I'm mad, check the record
What's a nigga gotta do to get respected
Sometimes I think I'm getting tested, and if I don't say "yes" a nigga quick to get arrested
That's the reason I stay zestin (??), I keep a vest on my chest incase the cops is getting
Restless
Walkin' round ready to light shit up, because my life is fucked, some say I'm slightly nuts
Buck buck is the sound as I move up, other niggas pay attention when a fool bust
They make a nigga be a killer, I used to be a dealer but they wanted to see whos realer
Now them same motherfuckas wanna murder me, and I wonder if the lord ever heard of me
I need loot, so I'm doin' what I do, and don't say shit until you've walked in my shoes,
There's no other destiny to choose, I had nothing left to lose, so I'm singin' the po nigga blues


(Verse 2 (Tupac)

Coppin these brand new shoes, but what the fuck can a nigga do, my little boy gotta eat too
So why must I sock a fella? Just live large like rocafella
And did you ever stop to think? I'm old enough to go to war but I ain't old enough to drink
Cops wanna hit me with the book, and you hooked on my "I don't give a fuck" look
Makin' rules, I'ma break em, no matter how much you make em, show me bakin, I'ma take em
So don't you ever temp me, I'm a fool for mine nigga, and my pockets stay empty
To my brother in the barrio, you livin' worse then the niggas in ghetto so
I give a fuck about your language or complexion, you got love for the niggas in my section
You got problems with the punk police, don't run from the chumps, get the pump from me
We ain't free, I'll be damned if I played a chip for a blonde haired blue eyed Caucasian bitch
Down with my home boy rich, fuck a snitch and groupie ass bitch
And a nigga with a cellular phone, leave his baby at home so he can go out and bone (huh)
And you wonder why we blazin' niggas, 'cause you punks haven babies can't raise the niggas
And they damned to be fuck ups too, drink 40s of brew, singin' the nigga blues


Why'd you sland crack? 'Cause I had to
Why'd you sland crack? 'Cause I had to
Why'd you sland crack? 'Cause I had to
And now I'm headin for the motherfuck in PEN
Nigga fuck that gin and juice, I'm fuckin' with Hennessey
Just pour me a glass of that dark shit
That's right

(2Pac) They wanna knows my role model, it's in a brown bottle
(S.B.) Ooh, ba-ba, ba-ba-dah
(2Pac) Hennessey (Hennessey) hahaha, yeah
(2Pac) They wanna knows my role model, it's in a brown bottle
(S.B.) Ooh, ba-ba, ba-ba-dah
(2Pac) Hennessey (Hennessey)

(Verse One: 2Pac)
Now I was born in the gutter facin life or death
I was a thug ever since my mama gave me breath
These motherfuckers wanna see me die, so who am I
To try to warn 'em, I buck and bomb 'em, them niggaz fry
Hey, remember me? Down that Hennessey
The nigga you don't wanna see, let me procede
My definition of some thug shit, y'all don't hear me
Now that it's poppin' ain't no love bitch
I maintain in the game in the gutter's where I still kick it
I'm tryin' to hustle up a meal ticket
I'm still wicked in my ways, a hustler till my dyin' days
Ain't nuttin wrong with gettin' paid, so nigga blaze
'Cause we some motherfuckin fools
Walkin' through the streets wearin jewels, breakin niggaz makin' moves
Even the cops can't stop us, my enemies flip
When they see me drink a fifth of that Hennessey

(Chorus w/ minor variations)

(Verse Two: Edi Amin)
Yeah
Up late nights (c'mon) under the city lights
The Henn got me feelin' right, I'm tryin' to keep from swervin
She's so fine and she love Henn too
After a couple of shots she said, "I could do what I wanna do"
(That's right) We ain't sippin champagne (nah) we off the Henn-Rock
Alcoholics back at the liquor sto' 'cause we can't stop (can't stop)
And won't stop (we won't stop) all night long
Till the break of dawn, gettin' it on, Hennessey

(Sleepy Brown)
Ooh, lady watchin' (lady watchin') as I'm glidin by (glidin by)
And the place is jumpin'... that I can't deny (no, no, no)
Ooh I can't wait to go in, throw my glass in the sky (glass in the sky)
For the people partyin, till the mornin light

(Chorus w/ minor variations)

(2Pac) Hahaha, y'all niggaz can't fuck with this ol' thug shit


(Sleepy Brown - over Chorus second half)
We keep on sippin, and sippin, and sippin

(S.B.) Keep on sippin, and sippin, and sippin, ba-ba, ba-ba-dah, Hennessey
Yo 'Pac yo, I heard you got beat up by the police
Got a big fat lawsuit and everything
Niggaz just wanna know
If you still gon' be on some crooked-ass sheeeit

(2Pac)
Please tell me what's a nigga to do, and it's true
Ain't nuttin new, so I do, what I can to get through
Now first they had me trapped and now I'm pissed
A loaded AK-47 lay under my head so I don't trip
One motherfucker from the Underground
And Big Stretch buckin niggaz if they fuck around
Yo why I got beef with police?
Ain't that a bitch that motherfuckers got a beef with me
They make it hard for me to sleep
I wake up at the slightest peep, and my sheets are 3 feet deep
I guess it's hard for you to see
But now I'm pointin the finger at police
Instead of them motherfuckers blamin me
I got the right to bear a pistol
And when the punk motherfuckers get to trippin' I got shit too
And maybe then you'll see the truth (hell yeah)
But until then, I gotta do what I do
And stay a crooked nigga too

(Chorus: Raphael Saadiq)
I've got to do, what I'm gon' do
I'm gon' say what I'm gon' say
I'm gon' live how I live - how else you want a nigga to live?
I'm gon' do, what I do
I'm gon' say, what I say
I'm gon' live how I live - how do you want a nigga to live?

(2Pac)
Y'know you really can't say that ya blame niggaz
Fuck bein tame, set aflame, time to aim triggers
2Pac'll spark a revolution, fuck the Constitution
I want my bucks for restitution
This time you got a bigger problem
Time to face the niggaz from South Central, Oakland, Brooklyn and Harlem
And we ain't shootin at each other
That's my motherfuckin brother, so Dave Duke, run for cover
And all the bitches from the Klan
Come feel the wrath of a black man that doesn't smoke crack and
I don't drink St. Ides (fuck that!)
Genuine Draft, ganja ganja, and my fuckin' tec-9
They know they scared to see us sober
Stop drinkin' King Cobra, and niggaz'll take the world over
It's all up to you (up to you)
Blame the Korean, blame the jew, or be a crooked nigga too


(2Pac)
Aiyyo! Why me? Play like Jasmine Guy and try me
I'll be damned if I die, come look at the rage in my eyes G
They got my homies in a jail cell
And it's the Rebel and the Devil, and one of us is goin' to Hell
I got the whole place covered, with loc'd out brothers
And nuttin but love for each other
So motherfucker make a motion
I give a fuck, slice you up, and throw your ass in the ocean
Temperatures drop; see it's cool to shoot a nigga
But they hate it when we pop the cops
That's when they gettin' petrol
You better watch your step or you'll be left on death row
But I learn to look ahead of me
Stay strapped watch your back keep your eyes on the enemy
We blowin' up precincts and Ooh
You can't fuck with the crew, of crooked nigga too


(Raphael Saadiq)
It's the coldest town from here to Georgia
(I'm a crooked nigga too)
It's the coldest town from here to Georgia
It's the coldest town from here to Georgia
(I'm a crooked... crooked nigga too)
It's the coldest town from here to Georgia
Y'all gon' stop fuckin' with me

(Chorus - repeat to fade)
(2Pac)
Now I've got to ask, on a nigga's ass, tell me will they blast me?
I think of an alias in case these crooked bitches ask me
Now, it's gettin' crazy after dark, these NARC's
Be like tryin' to shut me down but I'm too smart
Now picture me scared of the penitentiary
I've been movin these things since the days of elementary
Now tell me what you need when you see me
I'm stackin G's, buyin all the things on TV, believe me
I got some killers on my payroll, and they know
When it's time to handle business, nigga lay low
Although I'm young, I'm still comin' up
I'm gettin' paid, pullin razors on niggaz when they runnin' up
The first to pull a strap when there's drama - busta you ain't heard?
I've been slicin motherfuckers since I lost my mama
There ain't a cop that can stop me
My posse is cock D, and they don't quit until they drop me
I'm loyal to the game

("Prince of peace must hear our plea")
("Told life you'd be back") ("There you were")
("Prince of peace must hear our plea")
("Everybody look around") ("There is no hope")
("Prince of peace must hear our plea")
("Brothers we better get hip")

(Big Syke)
My mama say I'm crazy 'cause I'm all about the hood
I can't get my shit together but I'm on leather and wood
And the hood is all I know, patrol and circle the block
Off the curb and niggaz swerve, serve a smoker a rock
And I'm hot like fish grease and nigga so is my Caddy
And I'm steady catchin static, move the traffic to the alley
Out in Cali niggaz rally others all for the soil
Mix the work with bakin soda and get the water to boil
OH NO can't no busters hang, I hope you feel me mayne
Cause snitches bitches and they ain't been loyal to the game
My niggaz feel my pain, when sunshine turn to rain
You know these buster motherfuckers came to fuck the game
And it's a shame I see the mark in they eyes
When they yellin' that he tellin' get to me, no surprise, nigga


("And come off this trip")

(DJ Quik)
Loyalty, undeservedly, never heard of me
I, be the exception, the epitome of adaption
The superficial surroundings, bullets fiends cockhounds and
Enemies in my family extortin schemin and scammin me (pop pop)
I'm like loose rollin', I'm growin' until the diesel hit me
I'm badder than bruised, and madder havin' to choose
'Tween happiness and the blues, and who be fillin my shoes
When I done had it with crews, ecstatic to see me lose
But panic when I be smooth, I'm manic but I'm no fool
Y'all rappin' I'm talkin' cool, and Columbine is not new
In Compton they shoot up schools too, ridin' by to see who's who
Cock the shotty they cruise through, rock the body blood ooze through
Tell his family that dude's blue, no comin' back
From him scrappin when niggaz was packin and he wasn't packin too
So if you feel me you know when they try to kill me they slow
I seen from 'round the corner with mirrors and creeped up on 'em

(Chorus - 5/6ths)

("Thugs throw like wine down a nigga's throat
If this shit don't STOP STOP STOP STOP STOP!")
(Feat. Krayzie Bone)

Am I wrong 'cause I wanna get it on till I die?
Am I wrong 'cause I wanna get it on till I die?
Get it on till I die
Get it on till I die

(Verse 1: Tupac)
After the fire comes the rain
After the pleasure there's pain
Even though we broke for the moment we'll be balling again
Time to make y'all, my military be prepared for the busters similar to
Bitches to scary, get to near me we rush 'em
Visions of over packed prisons
Million's of niggas thug living
Pressure's, three strikes I hope they don't test us
So pull the heat out, ammunition in crate's (shh)
Move without a sound as we slide down pistols in place
I'm sensing niggas is defenceless I'm hitting fence's then getting ghost
Who can prevent me shooting senseless?
At these niggas throats
Bitch made niggas and that bullshit you going through
Outlaws busting while we rushing
We untouchable
Fuck you niggas and that bullshit you going through
We Outlaws rushing you busting you
We untouchable

(Chorus: Krayzie Bone and Tupac)
It's that Tupac (Pac)

It's that Tupac (Tupac)
(Y'all, Y'all remember me)

(Verse 2: Krayzie Bone)
You niggas better not try to run up
And don't try to say we ain't told you
You're dealing with killers and soldiers
Nigga these explosives, trying to blow shit, running you over
Nigga controller
Whenever y'all niggas try to roll up
Thinking I'm a ho, well, come and let me show ya
I'm a light up the rhythm like dosia
Dumping so potent, nigga don't choke up
Flow up
Makaveli The Don, got niggas strapped and ready to bomb
As soon as I send the alarm, and when we're done
We've committed a red rum, leaving the enemies dead and gone
Leaving 'em niggas head's blown, 'cause they know they dead wrong
When the shots ring out you know we're coming through (Know we're coming through)
Talk a lot with your mouth, well what you gon' do? (So what you gon' do?)
Shut 'em down, busters be knowing to keep they distance
Thugs don't fuck around
We get back at 'em so swiftly, niggas is with me underground
Slug in a niggas mug, reppin' Midwest Side
Niggas if you a thug get your weapon, let's ride
Ride for Pac, Pac, get live for Pac, Pac, Pop off the Glock, Glock
The thugging it don't stop

(Chorus x2: Krayzie Bone and Tupac)
It's that Tupac (Pac)
(Am I wrong 'cause I wanna get it on till I die?)
It's that Tupac (Tupac)

It's that Tupac (Pac)
(Y'all, Y'all remember me)
It's that Tupac (Tupac)
(Y'all, Y'all remember me)

(Verse 3: Tupac)
Only wish to breed
I explode into a million seeds
Y'all remember me
Legendary live eternally
Bury me in pieces 'cause they fear reincarnation
Niggas screaming peace 'cause they fear when my squad face 'em
Take them to places, stake they face then erase 'em and brake 'em
Murder motherfucker's at a rate and then quicken the pace
Blast me but never ask me to live a lie
Am I wrong 'cause I wanna get it on till I die?
(Westcoast)
Now I'm worldwide
Niggas gossip like girls then hide
No offence to Nas but this whole fucking world is mine
Even if you blind you can still see my prophecy
My destiny to overthrow those on top of me
Fiending for currency the money be calling
Can you feel me, dreaming?
Seeing scenes of me balling?
Fuck you bitch made niggas and that bullshit you going through
Outlaws busting while we rushing
We untouchable
Fuck you niggas and that bullshit you going through
We Outlaws rushing you busting you
We untouchable

What do you know about Pac's life
(What do you know? What do you know?)
(Only real niggas stay on top)
Everybody talking 'bout Pac's life
(Outlawz)

(Verse One: Tupac)

Started with five shots, niggas plotting to kill him
Never figured that, that same nigga sell five million
Hit the charts like a mad man nothing but hits
Court cases got a nigga facing multiple digits
Dodging cop cars look how we come so far
Picture a high school drop out
Rolling a double R
House full of happiness, weed and drank
Way out
So when trouble tried to find me can't
Never visioned living longer than my twenty first
Thought I'd locked down, cracked out or in the dirt
And though it hurts to see the change
It comes with the fame
Watch them gossip in this silly game
To all the motherfucker's speaking down on me this is the night
Why's everybody caught up In Pac's life?
To all y'all niggas
Conversating on my life
Mind your motherfucking business


(Verse Two: T.I)

I remember that
Ay
What's happening Pac
Yeah I know we never got to meet
But we know all the same people so we got to speak
You taught me first, fake nigga can't stop a G
And all the shit you went through
Meant a lot to me
But when they locked you up for for nothing it was shame to see
You we know the crack came and did the same thing to me
I get along with real niggas it's the lane to be
Talking loud out of pocket tryna bang with me
And so I pull it out my pocket let it rain you see
Now they all in the court room blaming me
See we ain't live the same life but represent the same struggle
Power to the real niggas death to the sucker's
Money over bitches, get to know 'em for you love 'em
Death before dishonour never talk to undercover's
Live by the same rules so I minus the tattoo's
With the same sort of dude with he same short fuse


(Verse Three: Tupac)

I want money in large amounts
My garage full of cars that bounce
Moving my tapes in major weight cause every dollar counts
Busters is jealous and half these niggas is punks
They running off at the mouth till I fill it up with my pump
They jump my automatic keep 'em weary
While you fronting like you Billy Bad Ass
Nigga you scary
I been knowing you for years
We was high school peers
In Junior High
I was itching' to kill
And you was, 'Ready To Die'
While you bullshitting niggas was dying and catching cases
Busting my automatics at motherfucker's in foreign places
Leaving no trace, they see my face and then they buried
Bitches die in a hurry
Still I ride, I'm never worried
Mr. Makaveli tell me to ride and I'ma ride
Pick my enemies out the crowd
And motherfucker's die
It's not the way I wanna live
My nigga it's how it is
Only real niggas stay on top


Why are all you niggas all up in my shit?
Tell them motherfucker's
Outlawz
Fuck all y'all
(Chorus: Carl Thomas)
Who you are,
One Nation under a thug and bullet scar,
Young nation, no revolution and no cause,
One Nation, young, black and dangerous by far,
Young nation just trying to get this

(Verse 1: 2pac)
Murderous mind state,
Can't keep my nine straight,
Sippin' on this Hennessy, waiting for the time to break,
Show up and muthafuckas bow down, recognize
Westside, Death Row, Outlaw, Ridaz,
Untouchable mob of pistol packers,
Well-known felons labeled for 'drug-selling merciless jackers',
Forever buzz, roll with thugs and dogs,
Commence the letting off rounds, then escape in the fog,
Who wants to see me solo?
Catch Makaveli while he sleeping,
My mini fourteen murdering niggaz while they creepin', (Uh)
Duck cause you ass out,
Drink till you pass out,
Ain't scared to die, drunk driving in my glass house,
Niggaz is under me,
They bitches come to me,
They heard the stories nigga, now they wanna really see,
Bomb First, my motto, it's fully guaranteed,
Niggaz is playa haters, label them my enemies,
I'm dumpin'

(Chorus: Carl Thomas)
Who you are,
One Nation under a thug and bullet scar,
Young nation, no revolution and no cause,
One Nation, young, black and dangerous by far,
Young nation just trying to get this

(Verse 2: Hussein Fatal)
When it's on, I'm poppin' off every chance I get,
Out the window on some uptown anthem shit,
I'm stressin', but ain't no pressure, I been here before,
Fugitive taskforce at my girlfriends' door,
Now they checkin' in her bedroom, I ain't there,
Forty Cals, extended clips, still I ain't scared,
Outlaw, and best believe they won't take me alive,
I'm different and I'mma prove it if it take me to die,
You think God had a plan for me?
But he won't be layin' up in my casket or doin' life in the can for me,
Maybe I'm brazen or paranoid than a bitch,
Me dyin', you think I'd let him see the joy from that shit?
Walking dead, angels spend their last days by me,
New Jersey Giant like Dave Tyree,
Young George or Jonathan Chat,
Your guns clap,
Mine will go 'br-r-r-r-att',
Soldier like Geronimo Pratt,
And come through cockin' tha black pound,
When they put the twin towers up, Pac, I'm knockin' 'em back down,
Poster child,
Air Force Ones, with the checks,
I'm supposed to wild sex,
Money and murder is all I breathe in my life,
It's full of judges and chasin' enemies in the night,
Through the Henny, I see the eyes of the Devil,
He's ridin' with extra boxes of bullets and a nina and a shovel

(Chorus: Carl Thomas)
Who you are,
One Nation under a thug and bullet scar,
Young nation, no revolution and no cause,
One Nation, young, black and dangerous by far,
Young nation just trying to get this

(Verse 3: Papoose)
I always thought I'd have to die to do a record with Pac,
So I wrote from the perspective of a graveyard box,
You end up in the box 'cause them grave robbin' bastards,
Dig your grave up and snatched you out the casket,
Worms in my eyes, eating through my cabbage,
The flesh to the bones,
The bones to the ashes,
But I'm not dead,
I'm actually in a session with the Pac Keeper, Sha Money, progressing,
They don't really want no drama, I know they goons,
That's why I keep pressure on 'em like a open wound,
This God given, he keep givin' me better music,
So every time you hear me, my songs present improvement,
Y'all can't kill me, y'all forever losin',
Songs of evolution,
If I load your gun for you and we bang it out with some other niggas, you better shoot it,
Don't try to lie and say you was bustin', I'm clever, stupid,
Claimin' you reppin' Ruthless,
You got the same bullets you had when I loaded it for you, you never used it,
The Nasareema dream, get ready for execution,
Papoose, Fatal and Pac
The revolution

(Chorus: Carl Thomas)
Who you are,
One Nation under a thug and bullet scar,
Young nation, no revolution and no cause,
One Nation, young, black and dangerous by far,
Young nation just trying to get this

Young nation just trying to get this

Just trying to get this
What's up boo (yeah)...hahahaha... yeah man
Another shady mission, (pause) tricks,
Like watchin picture's in hazy vision
Tonight it's love makin', take you any place you wish
Today we satisfy, yesterday was stolen kisses
Blind insanity perfect pictures of me and my family
Not understanding the death of me, had they plans for me
If I have kids, will I live to see em' grow
Though I don't know, I live the life of a thug nigga
Until the day I go with broken promises, a sacred bond broken
I know I die alone, but yet and still I'm hopin'
Vision's in prison's, maybe I'll be forgiven
I know it's better in heaven 'cause bein' here ain't livin'
Close my eye's and see nothin' but pain
The world's crazy, still lookin' for a queen
To plant seed's and have babies
Maybe I'll be the one, or just maybe I'm lost
You'll never know being cautious,
If you play your cards right

I wanna be the one who
Who you can depend on, who
Who'll be the one who'll be there
Through the thick and thin
Go by the water we won't leave until the mornin'
We won't leave until the night
And we will be forever more

(Keisha)
No one else can do, what you do for me
Take me away from the pain, I feel inside
And it's gonna be all right, and it'll be okay
If we try and take our time, yes baby, take our time
And we'll grow, trust I know
I wanna be the one whooo

I wanna be the one who
Who you can depend on, who
Who'll be the one who'll be there
Through the thick and thin
Go by the water, we won't leave until the mornin'
We won't leave until the night

And we will be forever more

(Pac) (Keisha ad-libs)
Gotta play your cards right on one
Can't be rushin like it's a race, you know what I'm sayin'
If you be patient and take your time
And you finesse it
9 times out of 10 homeboy, you gonna wake up wit ya breakfast in bed
But if you rush, (Hey)
And you just be man handlin, haha, (It takes a real man)
Your ass goin' home tonight, Haha (Hey)
Play your cards right nigga, take your time, be patient
Go slow, it's better that way
You ain't heard?
Playa cards right

I wanna be the one who
Who you can depend on, who
Who'll be the one who'll be there
Through the thick and thin
Go by the water, we won't leave until the mornin'
We won't leave until the night
And we will be forever more

(Pac) (Keyshia ad-libs)
Take your time man, (Take ya time)
Don't be in such a rush, (In a rush) Haha (Be forever more)
You got to be patient man, be patient
It ain't goin' nowhere one, (Nowhere)
Get some champagne, (Haha, be forever more)
Bring some roses or sometihin ya know
Play some soft shit,
Light a fire, (Luther Vandross)
You gotta be cool wit it, (Teddy, Teddy)
You gotta be slow wit it, (Ooh be so)
Got ta be patient, you gotta playa cards right on one
Can't be rushin like it's a race, you know what I'm sayin'
If you be patient and take your time
And you finesse it
Tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do
Now whatz next
Tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do
Now whatz next

Caught up in the middle, my life's a riddle, don't let it get ya
I wanna be legal but it's this hustle that get me richer
One love to my peoples makin' money, I can see you bubblin'
Avoid all trouble beware of devils continue strugglin'

Nothin's impossible if there's a will there's a way
So get your mind on official business, you can be great
And it's been this way from the cradle to the grave so get paid
My niggaz do this every fuckin' day we parlay

Through politics and conversation
This information to my thug niggaz in the congregation
Watch and bare witness to the pleasures of participation
Separation is self destruction, what's needed is unification

'Cause the world ain't hardly scared if not prepared
Be sure to be bummy and be no longer there
But no one cares it's there to share all we get is stares
Because of fear we'll evaporate say your prayers and whatz next?

Hard living's got me going insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle, I'm trapped in the game
Whatz next?
I'm going crazy
Tell me, tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do?
Whatz next

Hard living's got me going insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle, I'm trapped in the game
Whatz next?
I'm going crazy
Tell me, tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do?

Makaveli tried to warn us but niggaz ain't listen to Pac
Naw, listen, listen nigga really listen to Pac
Shit yean got it yet no then you won't get it
Might as well measure 'em up and have his ass fitted, why

Caught slippin' dog trippin' didn't soak game
Got his wig split like dem shutters on the airplane
Never will change niggaz wit' no name, no shame
Might open ya head foe mess broke change

I stay posted like a flag
Starin' through my rear view ballin' in a jag
Bounce wit me Cali body rock down in H-Town
We gon' put these artificial bustas in they place now

Time foe a change, real niggaz rollin' wit' me
Money makin' swift decisions we controllin' the streets
Side track by the broads and the frauds, ain't it strange?
It's the reason so many niggaz get scarred in the game, whatz next?

Hard living's got me going insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle, I'm trapped in the game
Whatz next?
I'm going crazy
Tell me, tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do?
Whatz next

Hard living's got me going insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle, I'm trapped in the game
Whatz next?
I'm going crazy
Tell me, tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do?

That money gotta make it what I gotta do to make it
Do I really gotta take it put this mack up to you face it
Doin' what we gotta do to survive
Just ask Kweli doin' what we do to get by

Some niggaz stick to the crime pitchin' nickel and dimes
What the fuck we suppose to do? Who gon' give us a job?
So I tried and tried, tried to get out the grind
But the block kept on callin' me back, fiends kept on callin' for crack

So I supply 'em wit' that, gave 'em a reasonable fee
Nigga don't blame it on me shit just look where I'm at
Niggaz in gardens L A P D is the target
Niggaz is heartless hustle regardless

Look that dope spot use to be an apartment
But now it's just a place to hide the guns in the closet
Watch ya step shift the grams under the carpet
We just tryin' hard not to see that coffin, whatz next?

Hard living's got me going insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle, I'm trapped in the game
Whatz next?
I'm going crazy
Tell me, tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do?
Whatz next

Hard living's got me going insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle, I'm trapped in the game
Whatz next?
I'm going crazy
Tell me, tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do?

Tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do
Tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do
Now whatz next?
Quit'staring at me like a infra-red nigga

(Chorus: Tupac)

Don't fall asleep
You can get your cash on nigga if you peep
Other niggas close there eyes seeing dreams in they sleep
But don't fall a sleep
Don't fall asleep
You can get your cash on

(Verse One: Tupac)

Pictures of plenty
Sippin' my glass full of Henny
Hands on my Semi -
- Automatic kill for pennies
Approach for contact
'Cause I'm live I multiply
Soon as I open fire
Niggas die with open eyes
Scared to take a nap
It's a trap
A long maze
Dreamin' of getting stacks
Makin' scratch the wrong way
What song says
We murder motherfuckas daily
Black out
Blow the the track out
My lyrics never fail me
I inhale strong weed
Then release the stress
Deliver the bomb shit from the East to West
Like Yayo
Niggas pull out
When I say so
Commence to poppin'
Motherfuckers copy it's fatal
Efficiently I delete and flee
The art of war living sucka free
Get with me
Mutherfuckers just don't sleep

(Verse Two: Young Buck)

I'm staring through my rear-view doing 'bout 90
The pedal to the metal
So I can't see what's behind me
Buckle up your seat belt
Eyes on the road
They know we riding dirty got playa hiding Gold
They go down to the projects, the clubs been closed
And then they wonder why niggas braking down O's
I'm a runaway slave
You get it nigga, off the chain
I got that Thug Life shit running through my veins
And now they scared
They knowing that I've been heaven sent
And yeah we know the dop coming from the President
But look at us
We ain't got shit to lose
The life we ballin' if we got a new pair of tennis shoes
In the Ghetto
Or better yet home-sweet-home
This is the land of the free, but to me that's wrong
I'm on my way to the White House
Strapped with my heat
So don't fall asleep
Come on nigga


(Verse Three: Chamillionare)

They say that the more they hate you
The more that it motivates you
My minds set on crime, my mentals set on the paper
62 hours and counting and I'm still awake
And they slipping me sleeping pill's with the will I break
Broke niggas always telling you how to make your cash and just
So I just stop listening and now my cash is up
Red dotted the media they always mad at us
I don't see them trying to mediate when they get they Gat's and bust
They just instigating as soon as they get the tape, it's dropped
And my niggas locked as soon as they get the case
Personally I ain't tripping on all that rapping stuff
I'm taking back my money counter's wasn't fast enough
Yup
I got a couple problems
And none of them is money
And pretend they love me and say they buddies
Sometimes I want to mauve with the Ruger
Kill ya like Freddie Kruger
These nightmare's just ain't as bloody
The media they always asking me what my passion is (And)
Money talks to I always have voice to answer this
I can't relax 'cause it's like I'm a fetty activist
See me on TV never a mattress

(Chorus repeated till end)

Don't go to sleep nigga
Don't close your eyes
Don't go to sleep
Sleep baby

(Fade away)
Shit

When I enter the first zone worst known mic holder
My Hummer roll up evacuating strapped soldiers
Inside strategy manifestin' military styles
Casually try da G when niggas battle me

My prophesied prediction, switch and move positions
Separated from his gun and bitch and watch 'em start snitchin'
I keep spittin' still stupid niggas fail to listen
I personify this thug livin', hell or prison

My ammunition varies, my voice carries
Watch me invite the whole world, me and the mob gettin' married
It seems all the fine screams pierce the dark
This is expected, a trick bitch where's your heart?

You mark, watch niggas fall when I call they name
We outlaws hold your head niggas all the same
Except some who want more out of life than stress
We still thuggin' 'til it's none left, don't sleep

We gon' ride, keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride, don't sleep
Blowin' pine, always hustlin' on the grind
'Cause I gotta get mine all the time, don't sleep

We gon' ride, keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride, don't sleep
Blowin' pine, always hustlin' on the grind
'Cause I gotta get mine all the time

Dumpin' on motherfuckers at random
Rapidly wit' accuracy, they shouldn't've talk bad to me
It had to be a motherfuckin' murder
I'm glad to be a nigga that did the murder

So sad to see another motherfucker floatin'
In plastic reef, sleep wit' his head wide open
Rapid release, keep the police coastin'
Casualties warrant in deep east Oakland

Yolk the nigga off the asphalt, drove off to the hills
Positioned him on his knees and blew the back off
Death with the lex ruger, death to ya
Niggas cry when the bullet fly, kill and execute 'em

I blast first 'til they body me like my guns in varieties
Runnin' wit' the real big willies you silly punks try to be
But front doin' my walk by's rollin' a blunt
Hand on my nuts in a getaway car full of stunts

Addicted to my nine movin' like crime through time
Poppin' niggas like pimples nigga nothin' simple 'bout mine
Etch-a-sketchin', dumpin' on all you punks at intersections
Day in and day out ain't no easy way outs or easy exits, don't sleep

We gon' ride, keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride, don't sleep
Blowin' pine, always hustlin' on the grind
'Cause I gotta get mine all the time, don't sleep

We gon' ride, keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride, don't sleep
Blowin' pine, always hustlin' on the grind
'Cause I gotta get mine all the time

When I hit the street all I can see is the grind
Blood sweat and tear when I bust my rhyme
Yeah I un for my folk like I load my nine
And when I let loose then no crew standin' but mine

I gives a damn 'bout lame nigga actin' schiesty
Same one knew I was in jail and didn't write me
Wanna fight me then come find me
Whateva you do shawty you betta think wisely

You might see me wit' a stack in the trap
I use my thoughts and pen similar to a saran wrap
A lil' lame nigga I'll neva be, yeah, I'ma keep it G
I'm from the Three and Scrap will neva sleep

We gon' ride, keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride, don't sleep
Blowin' pine, always hustlin' on the grind
'Cause I gotta get mine all the time, don't sleep

We gon' ride, keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride, don't sleep
Blowin' pine, always hustlin' on the grind
'Cause I gotta get mine all the time, don't sleep

Don't sleep
Don't sleep

Soon as I get home...

Soon as I get home...

Dear baby it's me
Again stuck inside this mad pen
Tryin' to pay my debt fpor all my sins 
These is penitentiary times
Be so heavy on my mind 
At times... it's like I'm livin' just to die
I'm livin' in hell
Stuck in my jail cell
Stranded in the county jail 
Waitin' for my chance to post bail
I wanna be paid in large stacks 
And mash in fast Jags
I blast and wonder how long will I last
My memories fade when I'm intoxicated
Bustas is shady 
So I'm dumpin' on cowards crazy whenever faded
I know I said it all before but now I mean it
Visions of me and you ballin'... so crystal clear I see it
Even though you mad at me 
You'll be glad to see the strategy
Of makin' these chips come... so easily
I max out in the morning baby life is good
Me and you against the whole hood 
Soon as I come home...

Garb my strap
Locate my comrades
Let's get my enemies not knowin' I'm comin' back
Go get the money out the safe
It's time to turn the streets into a warzone
Soon as I come home...

Sittin' here lookin' at pictures of me and you livin' 
But now you out in the world... while I'm twisted in prison
Love letters come daily
Words of affection
You send me money and nude pictures... beggin' for some sex 
Stay wide open keep your eyes peeled
And my advice is keep it it real or you could die squealin'
Plus I never have to worry about a visit 
'Cause you're there daily
Gaurds tryin' to get your number
You don't dare tell me
Tongue kissin' steady humpin'
Tryin' to touch you somethin'
'Fore the C.O. in the corner jump in
Frontin'
Late nights reminiscin'
Everybody's queit
I think somethin's in the air 
Prepare for the riot
It's padlocks in my socks
Steel from the bed springs 
I touch 'em with thug love
And then let they heads ring
Started a war but now I'm gone 
Release me to the streets in the morning
It's on 
Soon as I get home...

Grab my gats
Locate my comrades 
Let's get my enemies not knowin' I'm comin' back
Let's get my money out the safe

Since you've been gone 
My whole life's been like a game of c-low
Take and pick like they keep a c-note
Fillin' my dreams like Nino... Brown
The whole town be shook up
And me and mama survivin' 
Depends on how many rocks... the young nigga cook up 
Narcotics got drastic
Seen 'em niggas you blated 
Wantin' me in a casket
On the grind coppin' plastic
Yeah nigga I heard
Little Moo gave the word
You get parol on the third
It's all out we just heard 
We out here frontin' 
Still here but all about nothin'
My double o's what I'm wantin' 
And I'm tryin' to see somethin'
That we ain't never had
Luxury life results... livin' bad
Tricks of the trade 
Shit that should've been taught by dad
But learned through the crew 
Lessons between me and you 
And once we lock this shit down 
It ain't a thing they could do
Meawhile I stay waitin' by the phone 
Hopin' I get the call
Tellin' a nigga that you home...

(Outlawz)

(Verse One: Tupac)

Started with five shots, niggas plotting to kill him
Never figured that, that same nigga sell five million
Hit the charts like a mad man nothing but hits
Court cases got a nigga facing multiple digits
Dodging cop cars look how we come so far
Picture a high school drop out
Rolling a double R
House full of happiness, weed and drank
Way out
So when trouble tried to find me can't
Never visioned living longer than my twenty first
Thought I'd locked down, cracked out or in the dirt
And though it hurts to see the change
It comes with the fame
Watch them gossip in this silly game
To all the motherfucker's speaking down on me this is the night
Why's everybody caught up In Pac's life?
To all y'all niggas
Conversating on my life
Mind your motherfucking business


(Verse Two: T.I)

I remember that
Ay
What's happening Pac
Yeah I know we never got to meet
But we know all the same people so we got to speak
You taught me first, fake nigga can't stop a G
And all the shit you went through
Meant a lot to me
But when they locked you up for for nothing it was shame to see
You we know the crack came and did the same thing to me
I get along with real niggas it's the lane to be
Talking loud out of pocket tryna bang with me
And so I pull it out my pocket let it rain you see
Now they all in the court room blaming me
See we ain't live the same life but represent the same struggle
Power to the real niggas death to the sucker's
Money over bitches, get to know 'em for you love 'em
Death before dishonour never talk to undercover's
Live by the same rules so I minus the tattoo's
With the same sort of dude with he same short fuse


(Verse Three: Tupac)

I want money in large amounts
My garage full of cars that bounce
Moving my tapes in major weight cause every dollar counts
Busters is jealous and half these niggas is punks
They running off at the mouth till I fill it up with my pump
They jump my automatic keep 'em weary
While you fronting like you Billy Bad Ass
Nigga you scary
I been knowing you for years
We was high school peers
In Junior High
I was itching' to kill
And you was, 'Ready To Die'
While you bullshitting niggas was dying and catching cases
Busting my automatics at motherfucker's in foreign places
Leaving no trace, they see my face and then they buried
Bitches die in a hurry
Still I ride, I'm never worried
Mr. Makaveli tell me to ride and I'ma ride
Pick my enemies out the crowd
And motherfucker's die
It's not the way I wanna live
My nigga it's how it is
Only real niggas stay on top


Why are all you niggas all up in my shit?
Tell them motherfucker's
Outlawz
Fuck all y'all
Am I wrong 'cause I wanna get it on till I die?
Am I wrong 'cause I wanna get it on till I die?
Get it on till I die
Get it on till I die
Y'all, Y'all remember me
Y'all, Y'all remember me

After the fire comes the rain
After the pleasure there's pain
Even though we broke for the moment we'll be balling again
Time to make y'all, my military be prepared for the busters similar to
Bitches to scary, get to near me we rush 'em
Visions of over packed prisons
Million's of niggas thug living
Pressure's, three strikes I hope they don't test us
So pull the heat out, ammunition in crate's (shh)
Move without a sound as we slide down pistols in place
I'm sensing niggas is defenceless I'm hitting fence's then getting ghost
Who can prevent me shooting senseless?
At these niggas throats
Bitch made niggas and that bullshit you going through
Outlaws busting while we rushing
We untouchable
Fuck you niggas and that bullshit you going through
We Outlaws rushing you busting you
We untouchable

Krayzie Bone
You niggas better not try to run up
And don't try to say we ain't told you
You're dealing with killers and soldiers
Nigga these explosives, trying to blow shit, running you over
Nigga controller
Whenever y'all niggas try to roll up
Thinking I'm a ho, well, come and let me show ya
I'm a light up the rhythm like dosia
Dumping so potent, nigga don't choke up
Flow up
Makaveli The Don, got niggas strapped and ready to bomb
As soon as I send the alarm, and when we're done
We've committed a red rum, leaving the enemies dead and gone
Leaving 'em niggas head's blown, 'cause they know they dead wrong
When the shots ring out you know we're coming through (Know we're coming through)
Talk a lot with your mouth, well what you gon' do? (So what you gon' do?)
Shut 'em down, busters be knowing to keep they distance
Thugs don't fuck around
We get back at 'em so swiftly, niggas is with me underground
Slug in a niggas mug, reppin' Midwest Side
Niggas if you a thug get your weapon, let's ride
Ride for Pac, Pac, get live for Pac, Pac, Pop off the Glock, Glock
The thugging it don't stop

Krayzie Bone and Tupac

Tupac
Only wish to breed
I explode into a million seeds
Y'all remember me
Legendary live eternally
Bury me in pieces 'cause they fear reincarnation
Niggas screaming peace 'cause they fear when my squad face 'em
Take them to places, stake they face then erase 'em and brake 'em
Murder motherfucker's at a rate and then quicken the pace
Blast me but never ask me to live a lie
Am I wrong 'cause I wanna get it on till I die?
(Westcoast)
Now I'm worldwide
Niggas gossip like girls then hide
No offence to Nas but this whole fucking world is mine
Even if you blind you can still see my prophecy
My destiny to overthrow those on top of me
Fiending for currency the money be calling
Can you feel me, dreaming?
Seeing scenes of me balling?
Fuck you bitch made niggas and that bullshit you going through
Outlaws busting while we rushing
We untouchable
Fuck you niggas and that bullshit you going through
We Outlaws rushing you busting you
We untouchable

Uh, Wolf Haley, Golf Wang

I'm a fuckin' walkin' paradox — no, I'm not
Threesomes with a fuckin' triceratops, Reptar
Rappin' as I'm mockin' deaf rock stars
Wearin' synthetic wigs made of Anwar's dreadlocks
Bedrock, harder than a motherfuckin' Flintstone
Making crack rocks outta pussy nigga fishbones
This nigga Jasper tryin' to get grown
About five, seven of his bitches in my bedroom
Swallow the cinnamon, I'ma scribble this sin and shit
While Syd is tellin' me that she's been gettin' intimate with men
(Syd, shut the fuck up)
Here's the number to my therapist (Shit)
You tell him all your problems, he's fuckin' awesome with listenin'

Wolf Haley, Golf Wang
Wolf Haley, Golf fuckin' Wang

Jesus called, he said he's sick of the disses
I told him to quit bitchin', this isn't a fuckin' hotline
For a fuckin' shrink, sheesh, I already got mine
And he's not fuckin' workin', I think I'm wastin' my damn time
I'm clockin' three past six and goin' postal
This the revenge of the dicks; that's nine cocks that cock 9's
This ain't no V. Tech shit, or Columbine
But after bowling, I went home for some damn Adventure Time
(What'd you do?) I slipped myself some pink Xannies (Yeah)
And danced around the house in all-over print panties
My mom's gone, that fuckin' broad will never understand me
I'm not gay, I just wanna boogie to some Marvin
(What you think of Hayley Williams?)
Fuck her, Wolf Haley robbin' them
I'll crash that fuckin' airplane that that faggot nigga B.o.B is in
And stab Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus
And won't stop until the cops come in
I'm an overachiever, so how about I start a team of leaders
And pick up Stevie Wonder to be the wide receiver? (Cool)
Green paper, gold teeth, and pregnant golden retrievers
All I want – fuck money, diamonds, and bitches; don't need 'em
But where the fat ones at? I got somethin' to feed 'em
It's some cooking books, the black kids never wanted to read 'em
Snap back, green ch-ch-chia fuckin' leaves
It's been a couple months
And Tina still ain't perm her fuckin' weave
Damn

Wolf Haley, Golf Wang
Wolf Haley, Golf Wang, yeah
Goddamn goblin
Wolf Haley, Golf Wang
Wolf Haley, Golf Wang, yeah

They say success is the best revenge
So I beat DeShay up with the stack of magazines I'm in
Oh, not again! Another critic writing report
I'm stabbin' any bloggin' faggot hipster with a pitchfork
Still suicidal, I am
I'm Wolf, Tyler put this fuckin' knife in my hand
I'm Wolf, Ace gon' put that fuckin' hole in my head
And I'm Wolf, that was me who shoved a cock in your bitch
(What the fuck, man?) Fuck the fame and all the hype, G
I just wanna know if my father would ever like me
But I don't give a fuck, so he's probably just like me
A motherfuckin' goblin
(Fuck everything, man) That's what my conscience said
Then it bunny-hopped off my shoulder, now my conscience dead
Now the only guidance that I had is splattered on cement
Actions speak louder than words, let me try this shit
Dead
I never would've thought that
Feelings could get thrown in the air
Cause I accidentally caught that
I need some new boxing gloves, shit got hectic whenever I fought back
For example, ten minutes can't go past without you brushing my thoughts
That's fourteen forty a day so I'll say a hundred and forty four times
I think about you or something like that
Lost match, the fucking thought of you with somebody else
I don't like that; cellular convos getting left in the wrong
Cause I get so fucking mad when you don't write back
This isn't a song, I just happen to rhyme when I get emo
And find time to write facts (fuck)
I love you
Can we add some more color, um, like, some more, yellow
Yeah, that's good

I fucking hate you
But I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled, yeah
I fucking hate you
But I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled, yeah

Girl, you fucking with my emotions
The fuck is all this noise about?
I even considered picking up smoking
You turned to a bitch, who let the dogs out?
But in my dog house
My bitch is the raddest
Crazy who makes me the happiest
Can make me the saddest
Look Alice
Let's get lost in your wonder-er-land fuck an atlas
You're perfectly perfect for me
What the fuck is this, practice?
Actually, if you even consider leaving
I'll lose a couple screws in due time, I'll stop breathing
And you'll see the meaning of stalking
When I pop out the dark to find you
And that new dude that you're seeing with an attitude
Then proceed to fuck up your evening
Make sure you never meet again like goddamn vegans
Cause when I hear your name I can not stop cheesing
I love you so much that my heart stops beating when you're leaving
And I'm grieving and my heart starts bleeding
Life without you has no goddamn meaning
Sorry—I'm passive-aggressive for no goddamn reason
It's that my mood change like these goddamn seasons
I'll fall for you, but I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled
Yeah

The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it
The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it
The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it tonight
The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it
The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it
The sky's falling bitch, let's try to catch it tonight

C'mon baby
Even though I hate you
I still love you
I love you
And Salem, my love (I know)
I'm passive aggressive (I'm sorry, fuck)
(Come here)
I like when we hold hands
(You're the best around)
See I get jealous (fuck)
And if I see that nigga (If I see him)
I just might kill him (look)
(Look. I wanna strangle you, till you stop breathing)
Love, love, love
(Spend the rest of my life, looking for air)
(so you can breathe, or we can die together, you and me)
(Fuck, look)
I'm in love (Love)

I fucking hate you
But I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled, yeah
I fucking hate you
But I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled, yeah

"Yo, why is Samuel such a fucking dick?"
"He isn't such a badass actually. He's only here because he ran away, because some shit happened back home. He's actually a dweeb"
"Yo, what happened?"
Golden rubbers in these denim pockets
On my waist, there's a black Glock
New girl moved on the block
She been plottin' on my brown cock
Last night I slept over hers
During sex, I overheard
A sword sliced the air, I pulled out the na-na
Rolled off the bed, then shot back, pow-pow
Blood on the sheets, probably spillin' from my gash
Looked out the glass, seen you sprintin' on the grass
A real ninja, with the blade and the mask
Had them gold ninja stars, and red Supreme nunchuks
Now she tryna patch me up, but
Girl, I was just tryna get a nut bust
If that's your ex, you should probably own a pistol
But I'm guessin' it's wiser to exit with dude

The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Naked body, fresh out the shower
You touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in bed
But check your window (Swag)
He's at your window

Night light hits off, turnin' kisses to bites
I'm a down to Earth nigga, with intentions, that's right
You'll be down in Earth quicker if you diss me tonight
But I'll be the happiest if you decide to kick it tonight
We can chill and I can act like I don't wanna fuck
You can tell me all your problems like I really give one
But I give two for us cause you're the one that I want
Don't wanna seem like a punk pussy that simps over punk pussy
See when I'm with my friends I just put on a front
But in the back of my top I'm writing songs about we
We, as including I, and yourself, making three
Little ones, the drums are hitting pretty hard if you ask me
You're a pretty broad in the top three
Of things that I've been waiting to come, so
Meet me by the lake around 10 and skinny dippin' and then
We can begin the pretend game, I wanna be Finn
From Adventurin' Time

The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Naked body, fresh out the shower
You touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in bed
But check your window (Swag)
He's at your window

One, two; you're the girl that I want
Three, four, five, six, seven; shit
Eight is the bullets if you say no after all this
And I just couldn't take it, you're so motherfuckin' gorgeous
Gorgeous, baby you're gorgeous
I just wanna drag your lifeless body to the forest
And fornicate with it
But that's because I'm in love with you, cunt

I just wanna talk, and conversate
'Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate
And I finally got the courage to ask you on a date
So just say yes, let the future fall into place (Cunt)
I just wanna talk, and conversate
'Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate
And I finally got the courage to ask you on a date
So just say yes, let the future fall into place, cunt

Naked body, fresh out the shower
You touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom

You touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom

One, two; you're the girl that I want
Three, four, five, six, seven; shit
Eight is the bullets if you say no after all this
And I just couldn't take it, you're so motherfuckin' gorgeous
Swag, 2011
Young Nigga

Sick to my motherfucking tummy
Bitch must think I'm a motherfucking dummy
Because I dress bummy, bitch think I'm broke
Bitch, I ate one roach and I made a lot of money
Popping since Bastard, (manager) Clancy's my slave master
Thanks to them crackers, my pockets are fatter than excess shit that's weighing on Jasper
I've never popped a bottle, but I've fucked a couple models in Europe
Yup, and a couple of them swallowed
Meet me half way, bitch I'm going all in
And I never pull back, shout-out to my nigga Taco

Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, (Golf Wang!)
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang

So, a couple fags threw a little hissfit
Came to Pitchfork with a couple Jada Pinkett signs
And said I was a racist homophobic
So I grabbed Lucas and filmed us kissing
Feelings getting caught, it's off, I'm pissing
You think I give a fuck? I ain't even stick my dick in yet
(No homo. Too soon.)
And while y'all are rolling doobies
I be in my bedroom scoring movies
Still excited like a fucking newbie
Suck my dick, motherfucker, sue me
Mom got a new whip so she could scoop me
A year ago, I ain't have no hoopty
Four story home, gotta climb eight set of stairs
Just to see where my fucking roof be

Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, (Golf Wang!)
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang

Wait a God damn second
I'm tripping balls, David Beckham
Would fall cause shit's going down
Just like Rodney King swimming lessons
Now me and Justin smoke sherm and been talking 'bout freeing perms
And purchasing weapons, naming them and aim 'em in One Direction
(wait a minute)
It sounds like midgets in a God damn speaker
Anytime you play this shit loud
But that's just me trying to get milk now
And the grunts of the god damn cow
Hit me on my beeper while Captain Hook suck my Peter
Pan camera, repeat procedure
And when the beat drop, have a goddamn seizure

Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, (Golf Wang!)
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, (Golf Wang!)
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang

Cut it out! I said I didn’t want no goddamn lettuce. I don’t want that shit! I don’t want your goddamn lettuce. He-he
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, oh

You live in my dream state
Relocate my fantasy
I stay in reality
You live in my dream state
Anytime I count sheep
That's the only time we make up, make up
You exist behind my eyelids, my eyelids
Now I don't wanna wake up

20/20, 20/20 vision
Cupid hit me, cupid hit me with precision, I
Wonder if you look both ways
When you cross my mind, I said, I said
I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing
You're the one that's always running through my day dreams, I
I can only see your face when I close my eyes

Can I get a kiss?
And can you make it last forever?
I said I'm 'bout to go to war
And I don't know if I'ma see you again
Can I get a kiss? (Can I?)
And can you make it last forever? (Can you?)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war (I'm 'bout to)
And I don't know if I'ma see you again
(Uh, switch it up)

I said, okay, okay, okay, okie dokie, my infatuation
Is translatin' to another form of what you call it? (Love)
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, I ain't met you
I've been looking, stop the waiting
'fore I stop the chasing, like a alcoholic
You don't understand me, what the fuck do you mean?
It's them rose tinted cheeks, yeah it's them dirt-colored eyes
Sugar honey iced tea, bumblebee on the scene
Yeah I'd give up my bakery to have a piece of your pie
Yeugh!

20/20, 20/20 vision
Cupid hit me, cupid hit me with precision, I
Wonder if you look both ways
When you cross my mind, I said, I said
I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing
You're the one that's always running through my day dreams, I
I can only see your face when I close my eyes
(So)

Can I get a kiss? (Can I get a kiss?)
And can you make it last forever? (Make it last forever)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war ('Bout to go to war)
I don't know if I'ma see you again (See you again)
Can I get a kiss? (Can I?)
And can you make it last forever? (Can you?)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war ('Bout to)
And I don't know if I'ma see you again

Okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay, oh
La la, la la la la, la la
La la, la la la, la la
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay, oh
La la, la la la la, la la
La la, la la la la
One more time?
"I'm saying, you know, like. All I ever told you to do was grow up, don't grow down. You know, like, you know, grow up. Don't grow down, grow out. You go from being a kid, just doing your thing, hanging out with your friends. Months later you're world famous. You're a gay rights activist, and you don't even know it. You know what, I don't wanna say it to you no more, Tyler. Fuck you, Tyler!"

Watch me get this money, nigga; tired of being hungry, nigga
Nothing funny, sass me while I'm thrashing, I'ma punch you, nigga
Never made of plastic, I'm a savage -- you look lunch, my nigga
Passing all you hating fucking fags we don't discuss, my nigga
We ain't on no jolly shit and we don't pop no Mollies, bitch
I'm hocking, spitting got some niggas out here popping Ollie switch
Buncha novices, Odd Future the squad is thick
Them young niggas is back and brash, attacking with no common sense
We the last of a dying breed
And we don't give a fuck, so we cannot supply your needs
You stupid niggas who had said our hype is dying, please
My pockets solid, making profit off the highest tees
Bitch, merch twerk as I get on the verse, cursing
Nigga Dom so cool, I refer him in third person
Watch me get this money, I'm up when the birds chirping
Make actions, fuck rehearsing

Nigga, summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five
You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine

In a world where kids my age are popping Mollies with leather
Sitting on Tumblr, never outside or enjoying the weather
Can name a sweater, but not a talent or don't know if whether
Or not they got one, tried to change their life for the better
I was the drama club kid, I run where the fun did, my nuts itched
I was defiant, always said, "Fuck shit"
Hated the popular ones, now I'm the popular one
Also hated homes too, til I start coppin' me some
See I don't beez in the trap, nigga, I beez in the b's
And I be gassing up my buzz like some bees at a Shell
Fucking sick and getting bigger like I sneezed on Adele
And bitches getting touchy-feely like they reading some Braille
I bust quick like gun-holders with short tempers, and well
I tried to tell the kids, like fuck it, start being yourself
These fucking rappers got stylists cause they can't think for themselves
See, they don't have an identity, so they needed some help, but
Really, boy? Poseurs looking silly, boy
I'm in that past season 'Preme shit, older than Tity Boi
Not a diss, but same with ice cream, my shit is Diddy Riese
Na'kel Smith, Transworld page 64
Poppin' like oil ollie in fire flames
I'm harder than DJ Khaled playing the fucking quiet game
The fuck am I saying? Tyler's not even a violent name
About as threatening as stained windbreakers in hurricanes
But he rapes women, and spit wrong, like he hates dentists
God damn menace, 666 and he's not finished
And my shit's missing, he hates women, but love kittens?
See y'all niggas tripping, man
Look at that article that says my subject matter is wrong
Saying I hate gays even though Frank is on 10 of my songs
Look at that Mom who thinks I'm evil, hold that grudge against me
Though I'm the reason that her motherfucking son got to eat
Look at the kid who had the 9 and tried to blow out his mind
But talk is money, I said, "Hi," I guess I bought him some time
Look at the ones in the crowd -- that shit is barnacles, huh?
They thought I wasn't fair until I threw a carnival, huh?
But then again, I'm an atheist that just worships Satan
And it's probably why I'm not getting no fucking album placements
And MTV could suck my dick, and I ain't fuckin' playing
Bruh, they never played it, I just won shit for they fucking ratings
"Analog" fans are getting sick of the rape
All the "Tron Cat" fans are getting sick of the lakes
But what about me, bitch? I'm getting sick of complaints
But I don't hate it when I'm taking daily trips to the bank
Oh but no but, shit, who really gives a fuck what I think?
My fans don't, they turning on me, shit, they're almost extinct
Fuck buying studio time, I'ma go purchase a shrink
Record the session and send all you motherfuckers a link, bitch

Nigga, summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five
You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine

Summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five
You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine

This shit just like the nights I look forward to not remembering
So much for being sober, I hope that you can forgive me
But Momma, I'm close to the edge as possible (Why don't you jump, you fucking pussy?)
All I’m seeing is the drop in my ocular, jumping like they told me
That the 40's half off, like you know that cliff
Don't need a therapist to tell him he could float that shit (Fucking faggot)
Or get compared to fucking pair with all the program kids
So maybe a pair of pale bitches for the gonads lick (I'll show you)
Malt liquor filling me up, and all us not giving no fucks and
All of them sensitive chumps in awe when that pistol erupts (Pistol, I got one!)
Dirty one spitting that sumpy raw till his wrists in the cuffs
Brother the Pigeons is us
Bid you goodnight and good luck
(Oh, shut the fuck up!)
(Gunshot)

Samuel's here! Where's Wolf? Fucking faggot. Salem was mine, bitch! Was that good enough, you fucking pussy?
Yo, fuck 2DopeBoyz and fuck Nah Right
And any other fuck-nigga-ass blog that can't put an 18 year old nigga
Making his own fucking beats, covers, videos and all that shit
Fuck you post-Drake-ass cliche-jerking, LA-slauson rapping
Fuck-nigga-ass Hypebeast niggas, now back to the album

Well, Tyler, hi, I'm Dr. TC and um, I'm guessing that your teacher sent you here to talk cause you were misbehaving
Um, it's gonna be three sessions: today, tomorrow, and the next day
So, just tell me something about yourself...
Well, look, if you don't talk, I mean, these sessions are going to go slower

This is what the devil plays before he goes to sleep
Some food for thought? This food for death, go ahead and fucking eat
My father's dead, well I don't know, we'll never fucking meet
I cut my wrist and play piano cause I'm so depressed
Somebody call the pastor, this bastard is so possessed
This meeting just begun, nigga I'm Satan's son

My mother raised me a single parent so it's apparent
That I got love for my mother, none of you other fuckers
Are much important I'm getting angrier while recording
I'm feeling like the bulls, I've got a gang of wolves
Odd Future is children that's fucked up in they mental
Simple but probably not, fuck them

I'm tall, dark, skinny, my ears are big as fuck
Drunk white girls the only way I'll get my dick sucked
Suspended from school, coolest nigga without effort
Easy to spot like black bitches with fake leopard
Soak me up in a tampon, but keep the lamp on
Cause this album pack enough evil
That you can't fit inside a Jansport, go to school with this

I go from AP to JC inside a fucking week
Waking up with random girls like "Yo, bitch, how the fuck we meet?"
I stay with grandma, she always bitching about her carpet
Every time I walk inside the house, she always tend to start shit
No to drugs I never spark it, I used to be bullied for honor classes
By those that were slow as molasses, take this shit to school

Raquel treat me like my father like a fucking stranger
She still don't know I made Sarah to strangle her
Not put her in danger and chop her up in the back of a Wrangler
All because she said no to homecoming, demons running
Inside my heads telling me evil thoughts
I'm the dream catcher but nothing but nightmares I caught, go to sleep

I wear green hats because I'm fortunately lucky
Fuck me the monster said, somehow the monster's dead
Inside of me, but the thoughts it tells me are still evil
With this state of mind, big moves, Max Keeble
I'm on my grind feeble, my music is either
A fucking sin or too illegal play this shit in church

I graduated without honors or fucking father
He died (I'm so sorry) No bitch, don't even fucking bother
I wanted a brother my mother I told her
But instead I got a sister, just like me with her mister nada
So both of our imaginations are creations of the fucking situation
That's having our brains racing like Dayton, wearing some fucking Heelys

I know you fucking feel me, I want to fucking kill me
But times I'm so serious, you think I'm silly
I'm doing Big Style Willy couldn't touch 11
Seven, what's religion nigga? I am legend
I roll with skaters and musicians with an intuition
I created O.F. cause I feel we're more talented
Than 40 year old rappers talking about Gucci
When they have kids they haven't seen in years, impressing their peers
With the same problem, the only way to solve them
Is to go to Father's Day convention with a gold revolver
Life's a salad, I'm a toss it, eat that shit up, Rick Ross it
Shit it out, bag it up, sell it, I'm so damn rebellious
Cause my mother let me do what I want
She wasn't careless, protective she is the bear
The shit is so bare, my diary isn't hid
My father didn't give a fuck, so it's something I inherit
My mom is all I have so it's never meet the parents
When Danielle or Milan decide to fucking share
This confused boy, I wanna hug hoy, I’m bad for you kids to listen to
Soy is not the choice, I'm bad milk, drink it

Whoa, umm, it seems you had a lot to say
Uh, who knows I might feel as I'm evaluating

My wrist is all red from the cutter
Dripping cold blood like the winter, the summer
Is never that's equivalent to me and Sarah
Well that's not her fucking name, but I think this shit is clever
My niggas wanna know if I'm fucking, if I'm kissing
But I'm sitting here downing beers simply just wishing
With a tear they try to tell me but I never listen
Cause I don't give a shit like sitting down pissing
Eighteen, still talking to imaginaries
Hopefully they see the talent I carry just like Jimmy
Losers can never win me, you can never offend me
My goal in life is a Grammy, hopefully momma will attend the
Ceremony with all my homies, I'm suicidal
This my Zombie Circus, I hope the majors heard this
Fuck a deal, I just want my father's email
So I can tell him how much I fucking hate him in detail

Wow, umm, so Tyler if you had the chance to tell him something
What would you tell him?
Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale!

They say I've calmed down since the last album
Well, lick my dick, how does that sound? (Umm)
Smell my gooch, you could kiss my buns
And I don't give a shit, bend my rectum
Somebody said bands make her dance
You think you're getting cash, no bitch, you're dumb
The only thing that you're gonna get is this dick
Wait turn this up, bitch, this my jam (Where the drums at?)
Here, take a goddamn picture
And tell Spike Lee he's a goddamn nigga
And while you're at it, pass the lotion
And fapping and Xbox Live, that fun
Before I cum, I'm calling your sister
When she comes over, I take picture
Instantly put it on Instagram
And suplex her off a building if I get banned

Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale!
Why y'all so salty? Hot tamale is on
A can of beans, bitch, I'm on
Your boy is bad to the bone

Bring back the horns that was played in the beginning
And tell Tony Parker that I found his vision
And if he's tripping off my sneak dissing
Then he has to deal with me and my minions
Tryna get a bimmer, E46
Have you heard "48", motherfucka I'm great
Golf Wang prints always cover the sleeves
From cuts for the Biebs, 'cause he's puffin' the trees, please
Fuck I look like? Got a new bike tire
Never pop like the puss on a butch dyke
Think I give a fuck, I do go raw
Then I bust in her jaw like (Fuck that disease!)
My urethra, hole that I pee from
Bigger than the obese neck on Aretha
Now turn that snare down
I'm back like I'm Rosa Parks fare on the same damn bus
Like, "You're going to jail now!"

Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale!
Why y'all so salty? Hot tamale is on
A can of beans, bitch, I'm on
Your boy is bad to the bone

How much wood could a woodchuck chuck?
If a woodchuck could ever give a fuck?
Bitch Suck Dick, motherfuck you and your opinions
(Can you kick it?) Yes, I can sir, where the lump is
Sicker than the last bar bold-er, I’m a CO
Colorado, fuck Michael, bitch, I’m badder than my BO
Find me and Lance tryna dance during chemo
Before they repossess our strong arm bands and tuxedos

Yeah, buddy, this is my jam, na na na na na na na!
Golf Wang, Golf Wang, no, fuck you, na na na na na na!
Why y'all so salty? Hot tamale is on
Can't agree? Bitch, I'm on
Your boy is bad to the bone

How many fags can a lightbulb screw?
Well if it has a dick, maybe two or six
And tell the NRA I'm about to lose my shit
Shoot through Wayne LaPierre's hair with a crucifix
How many ladies in the house?
How many ladies in the house without a rich nigga, huh?
A little Jergens in my palm for the jerkin'
Hope my mom don't catch me, tryna set mood
Little Redtube, fuck lotion, I don't need lube, dry fist suits me
Up and down, the friction makes a squeaky sound, the shit's kind of disgusting
Fap time and before I flatline, Clancy chimes in my room and catch me
This shit's so damn embarrassing like...

Oh, shit, aw fuck
What the fuck!
Aw, I'm sorry
Is that my shirt?
Yeah, sorry, I needed something
Clean that shit up, we're going to the office!
Yo, who dat boy? Who him is?
Him that ni-guh, I swear
Stand out guy, him don't need no chair
Well, where the fuck him at? 'Cause nigga, I'm right here
I don't shop at the mall, all y'all just
Dumb mothafucka, I'm a goddamn artist
You can give me some markers and I'll draw you a closet
And you know that it's GOLF, bitch, gonna make the deposit
Nigga fresh to death like he got dressed in a coffin
Cons, overalls, and a striped shirt
The boy drips swag like a broken faucet
It's runnin', nigga, I'm runnin' shit
That cherry be the bomb like he ran in Boston
Won't stop 'til the cops surround him
One nigga jiggy and the other awesome
With his fuckin' face blown off, that's how they found him
It's Young T

Who dat boy? Who him is?
Who dat boy? Who him is?
Nigga, who dat boy? Who him is?
Who dem boys? Nigga, who dem is, nigga?
Why you niggas feel like that?
Mad 'cause a nigga neck chill like that
You mad 'cause a nigga push wheel like that?
Why you puttin' bad vibes in the air like that?
Nigga, who dem boys?

Who dem is? Nigga, who dem is?
Who else step in this bitch this jig?
Who else your bitch say got a bick this big?
Who else came through with a wrist this flick?
Nigga, Guess my pants, do my dance
Spin around, bitch, you could kiss my ass
Never seen a nigga in this much Raf
Still doin' math when I miss my class
Was it Summertime '06, had the Number (N)ine
Nigga, never mind, was another time before Vince
Had the Gucci gold tips with the letterman
Nigga, dollar sign was my favorite number at the time
Fresh freshmen 'til they skipped my ass
Senior citizen, don't forget my pass
Been that nigga and you knew that there
Make the dick disappear, how she do that there?

Who dat boy? Who him is?
Who dat boy? Who him is?
Nigga, who dat boy? Who him is?
Who dem boys? Nigga, who dem is, nigga?
Why you niggas feel like that?
Mad 'cause a nigga's neck chill like that
You mad 'cause a nigga push wheel like that?
Why you puttin' bad vibes in the-?

Fuck the rap, I'm tryna own a planet
From my other fuckin' business ventures
These niggas these days
Actin' like some bitches, like they're fuckin' with ya (yeah)
Teeth is glistenin', Jesus, Christmas
He just shittin', she exquisite, bitches be expensive
(Yeah, let 'em know, nigga) And I don't even need attention
WANG$AP on the bumper sticker, fuck you niggas
Fuck global warming, my neck is so frío
I'm currently lookin' for '95 Leo
My mom say she worried because I'm so ill
I should stay in bed, but got too much bread
To make, she said watch my weight
So I stayed home and start eatin' some meals
Get out of my way, way, boy that's McLaren
That's 0 to 60 in 2 point nueve, I'm gone
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
AAAAHHH!

Satan's getting jealous of the wolves, the demons say they preferring us
Books on not giving a fuck is what they're referring us (Wolf Gang)
Wolves, I know you heard of us, we're murderers
And young enough to get the fucking priest to come and flirt with us
You niggas rap about fucking bitches and getting head
Instead I rap about fucking bitches and getting heads
While you niggas stacking bread, I can stack a couple dead
Bodies, making red look less of a color, more of a hobby
I'm not a rapper nor a rapist nor a racist
I fuck bitches with no permission and tend to hate shit
Brag about the actions in a rhyming pattern matter
Then proceed to sat her down when I go splatter in her chatterbox
Atta boy, Odd Future, you're not in our categore
Torture with the super soaker at the asian liquor store
This the type of shit that make a Chris Brown want to kick a whore
That make songs about the wet blockers when it rains and pours
(Umbrella) I hate this, screaming fuck patience
Got a nigga shaking like the calmest fucking Haitian
After chronic masturbation, asking where Mary-Kate went
I want to be the reasons why all lesbians hate dick
I make this damn Bullwinkle the red moose
Game of duck-duck-duct tape with a dead goose
She running 'round this motherfucking dungeon, her legs loose
Until I accidentally get the saw to her head, oops

Victim, victim, honey, you're my fifth one
Honey on that topping when I stuff you in my system
Rape a pregnant bitch and tell my friends I had a threesome
You got a fucking death wish? I'm a genie, it'll get done
Nice to meet you, but it's more pleasant to eat you
With a leaf of salad and some dressing pouring out a teacup
Bitch, I'm Tyler the Creature, suck your feet up like a beach of leeches
Rubber more than the fucking bottom of a sneaker
Jeeper the fucking creeper, get your daughter and keep her
In the jeeps where the Wolf Gang rides around deeper
Take her to Ladera, now she's scared and you're embarrassed
Filled with terror, chop her legs off and tell her to run some errands
Put her eyes in a canteen, take her to the Berrics
Stare at Steve, say it costs ten to fuck Eric
Put her in the lake, her body sinks great, now it's time to fish her like Derek
Satan says we're dangerous, we're trading kids for angel dust
And snuff and sniff, and now that Michael Jackson's trying to suck our dick
Hippopot the fucking llamas, dead bodies, cheerleading squaders
Gave the team a bunch of fucking bees and the Keke Palmer
They will never catch him or catch up
They asked me what it was, I told them fuckers it was ketchup
Nutty like my Chex mix, she bleeding from her rectum
Odd Future wolves stirring ruckus, throwing sets up, yep

This the type of shit that make children break in apartments
When you tell a fucking orphan you don't love them 'til they heart thin
(I hate you!) Starve her 'til I carve her then I shove her in the Rover
Where I cut her like a barber with a Parkinson's disorder
Store her in a portable freezer with me to Portland
Catch me with a bunch of fucking Mexicans crossing the border (arriba!)
I'll be the only wetback who ain't really touched the water
Cause I'll be too fucking busy tryna flirt with Jesus' daughter
(Fuck Mary) I'm awesome, and I fuck dolphins
Sicker than the starving Nigerian kids barfing
Odd Future Wolf Gang Nazi bar mitzvah
With your sister at the bar playing leg and arm twister
Evident that I'm the shit, I'm the Pooh like Tigger dick
I got these cracker doctors saying, "yeah Bob, this nigga's sick"
Animal safari, if I offend you I'm sorry
Because I'm the blackest skinhead since India Arie
I don't smoke weed, so no need for the matches
I said fuck coke and now I'm snorting Hitler's ashes
I plan on either dying for suicide or my asthma
Being the only bastard in a box logo casket
Rashes on my dick from licks of shishkabob Sagets
In some Kanye West glasses screaming out "fuck faggots"
Catch me in my attic taking photos of my dad's dick
Drop the beat here to make it extra climactic

What the fuck?
I'm speechless, that was, fuck
Shit, Tyler, you're gonna need some help
I'm not a.. fuck it, different subject
How's that girl you were telling me about?
Part I: 911

(Call me, call me, call me) Uh
(Call me, call me, call me) Uh

(You should call me)
911, call me some time
911 (You should call me, oh)
911 (Call me)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My thirst levels are infinity and beyond
Sippin' on that lemonade, I need a Beyoncé
Can't see straight, these shades are Céline Dion
Sucks you can't gas me up, shout out to Elon
Musk, yeah, I got a sold out show
Crowd wild out but don't matter 'cause you not front row
I've been lookin' for a keeper, listen to the speaker
If you fit description, hit me on my beeper
At that 911

Call me some time (ring, ring, ring)
Please bang my line, you know I'll answer (click)
Call me some time (ring, ring, ring)
Please bang my line

Call me
911, call me some time
You should call me
911, call me some time
911, (you should call me, oh)
911, (you should call me)

Chirp, chirp
Chirp, chirp
Woke up in the 'burbs, 'burbs, with the birds, birds
Where you used to come and get me with the swerve, swerve
These days you gotta find time
Even the night line
Work line
Dial nine

Five car garage
Full tank of the gas
But that don't mean nothing, nothing
Nothin', nothin', without you shotgun in the passenger
I'm the loneliest man alive
But I keep on dancing to throw 'em off
I'm gon' run out of moves 'cause I can't groove to the blues
If you know any DJs, tell 'em to call me at 911...
Part II: Mr. Lonely

I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Old lonely ass nigga
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Forreal, you need to go somewhere, like, get some bitches or something
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Old weird ass nigga
I can't even lie, I've been
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely

They say the loudest in the room is weak
That's what they assume, but I disagree
I say the loudest in the room
Is prolly the loneliest one in the room (that's me)
Attention seeker, public speaker
Oh my God, that boy there is so fuckin' lonely
Writin' songs about these people
Who do not exist, he's such a fuckin' phony
One thing I know, is that I wanna
Win so bad, but I'm not Chicago
Heart is low, it's real low, it's so low
You can't lift me up, I'm like Gallardo
From the start it's been real dark
It's been so dark, I guess that you could call me charbroiled, huh
I'm playin' like Hasbro
I'm really Saari, call me Arto
Crashed the McLaren, bought me a Tesla
I know you sick of me talkin' 'bout cars (skrrt)
But what the fuck else do you want from me?
That is the only thing keepin' me company
Purchase some things until I'm annoyed
These items is fillin' the void
Been fillin' it for so long
I don't even know if it's shit I enjoy (ohh)
Current battle as an adult
My partner is a shadow
I need love, do you got some I could borrow?
Fuck it, I could find some tomorrow
But that never comes
Like a vasectomy, what have I done?
I got the talent, the face and the funds
Found myself long ago but I haven't found someone (who)
Mirror, mirror on the wall (who)
The loneliest of them all (me)
Cupid actin' stupid
Do you got another number I could call?
Never had a pet
I've never had a pet
There's more fish in the sea
But I never had a goldfish to begin with
I never had a dog
So I've never been good with bitches
'Cause I never threw a ball, fetch
I never had a pet, that's where it stems from, I bet
Treat me like direct deposit
Check in on me sometime
Ask me how I'm really doin'
So I never have to press that 911

Ohh! Damn! Damn!
Sawed-off, I eat those
These clothes, they free though
Straight from the back of the Supreme store
Don't give a fuck about these hoes--
Hold on, hold on, hold on, run that shit back!

Thirsty for the clips till I'm not flow

Now hop off my dick, what it be
Bitch, Mob, Task, Force, Lil, B, nigga

I'm watching Freaks and Geeks with the trampoline on the floor
I'm tryna cop the new McLaren with the vertical doors, nigga

Money, money, money, money
Money ain't the motive
What's your name again? Nobody knows it
Don't speak to me nigga, you not impo'tant
I'm focused
(Two, three, four) Bring in the horns
They say I'm nutty, I'm picnic basket
I'm short of a sandwich, I'm peanut butter
Boyce Watkin's a faggot, please come and get me
Said I suck him at your neck, like a hickey, boy I'm sicky
Like a HIV victim, ain't nobody fuckin' with me
I got banned from New Zealand, whitey called me a demon
And a terrorist, goddammit, I couldn't believe in it
Ban a kid from a country, I never fall, never timber
But you fucked up as a parent, your child idol's a nigga

Tyler, The Creator sweatin' Jesus juice
Put that fuckin' cow on my level, 'cause I'm raising the stakes
Mom, I made you a promise, it's no more section 8
When we ate it's the steaks, now our section is great
'Cause that's the level I'm at, my niggas pass 'em a plate
'Ye!

Why, oh why, why, why don't they like me?
'Cause Nike gave a lot of niggas checks
But I'm the only nigga to ever check Nike

Richer than white people with black kids
Scarier than black people with ideas
Nobody can tell me where I'm headin'
But I feel like Michael Jordan
Scottie Pippen at my weddin'
They say I'm crazy, but that's the best thing goin' for me
You can't Lynch Marshawn if Tom Brady throwin' to me
I made a million mistakes, but I'm successful in spite of 'em
I believe you like a fat trainer taking a bite or somethin'
I wanna turn the tanks to playgrounds
I dreamt of 2Pac, he asked me "Are you still down?"
Yeah, my nigga; it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on
I know they told they white daughters
"Don't bring home Jerome"
I am the free nigga archetype
I am the light and the beacon
You can ask the deacon
It's funny, when you get extra money
Every joke you tell just be extra funny
I mean, you can even dress extra bummy
Cocaine, bathroom break, nose extra runny
And I gave you all I got, you still want extra from me
Oxford want a full-blown lecture from me
And the Lexus pull up, errr, like hop, I hopped out, like wassup?
Err-err-err, step back, hold up, my nigga, you suck, hold up
I studied the proportions
Emotions runnin' at a Autobahn speed-level
Had a drink with Fear, and I was textin' God
He said "I gave you a big dick, so go extra hard"

For your boy
I'm tryna cop the new McLaren
With the vertical doors

And a couple trees, where the money grow
And get bodies burnin'
'Cause I'm tryna hang like I'm Mr. Cooper
Or Jews in Berlin
Or some niggas from Alabama, Birmingham
My new music's all over the street like Erick Sermon was
Fuck us
Maybe we should team up
Anti-Golf boys
'Cause I don't fuck with me either
I'm a liar, I'm a faggot (Uhh..)

Son you need Jesus
But I heard he left Sunset, to go on tour with Yeezus
Well, I'm prayin' for the new Yeezys
And you pussies prayin' that we squash the beef, like zucchini
I know; it ain't gain, nor fame, nor tame
Or lame, nor strange

Nah faggot, it's Golf Wang
(2, 3, 4)
You wouldn't do that Tyler, kill yourself or anyone. You don't even have the balls to begin with. What you need is me, someone to talk to, uh, it's been a while since our last session. So, tell me what's been going on

I'm not a fucking role model (I know this)
I'm a 19 year old fucking emotional coaster with pipe dreams
Since Kanye tweeted telling people he's bumping all of my shit
These mothafuckas think I'm 'sposed to live up to something? Shit
I'm still jacking off and proceeding my life careless
But getting more pussy cause I tell bitches I'm Wood Harris (as you should)
Philly to Paris, I'm getting these weird stares
At skateparks and airports all in a year, it's weird
Yonkers dropped and left them craniums mindfucked
Now competition missing like that nigga my mom fucked
He still hasn't called me yet (that's not your fault)
But that's a whole fucking different argument, shit, I got over it
And a couple bucks in my pocket, so now I could go buy
A couple hot pockets and grandma could stop cooking
Them nasty ass collard greens, pressure's on me like this top hat
Bastard intro, how the fuck I'm gonna top that?

"Tyler, you'll top it, you'll top that, you're a very capable individual"
"Okay, you guys caught me, I'm not a fucking rapist or serial killer, I lied"
"You know, you just want attention, you'll be fine"
"I try too hard, huh?"
"No, you don't"

Made a couple thou' and I just don't know what to buy yet
The 'preme shit is free and I don't drink, so fuck a wine set
Nigga, fuck a mindset, my brain is an obscenity
I'm fucked in the head, I lost my mind with my virginity
Oh, that's a triple three six, isn't he a devil worshiper
Cause I'm too fucking ignorant to do some research?
I'm the star of the group (Yeah)
So no one else gets the respect that they deserve cause of you
(Bastard was good though) What you think I record it for?
To have a bunch a critics call my shit a bunch of horrorcore?
Like I didn't make "Parade" or "Inglorious"
Cause I'm too scared to tell my friends the way I really fucking feel?
Of course they only listen to lyrics about me pissin' off
In the tombs of Lara Croft, I'm getting pissed off (I bet)
Message boards are on my dick, I need a pissing waiver (here)
Let me bust one in they mouth, I know they full of flavor

"Can't they just be happy for me like, a kid with nothing, living out his dreams? Why they got to fucking hate?"
"I think everyone's happy, everyone's immature, everyone loves you Tyler, you have to believe that."
"I don't even skate anymore, I'm too fucking busy, I can barely kickflip now."
"Why? Why is that? Do you not have any free time at your home?"
"What the fuck you mean I'm not talented? You see the shit that I've been doing?"
"I have, I mean you're a great person."
"I mean, I'm not that great of a rapper but as a whole, I'm pretty cool, right?"

People excited, thinking shit is so tight (For what?)
Getting co-signs from rappers that I don't even like
What the fuck you want me to do? Start to gobble his mic?
And start Jackson him off until his cack blasting off? (No...)
Fuck that, (Yeah) These niggas ain't fucking with me
Cause I don't listen to the Immortal of Tech-of-the-nique
And all this underground bullshit that's never gon' peak
On the Billboard Top 20 and Jam of the Week
I'd rather listen to Badu and Pusha the T
And some Waka Flocka Flame instead (All that shit) of that real hip hop
That's bull-of-the-sheet, but they want to critique
Everything that we, Wolf Gang, has ever released
But they don't get it, (They don't, it's not made for them) cause it's not made for them
The nigga that's in the mirror rapping, it's made for him
But they do not have the mindset that's same as him
I'm not weird, you're just a faggot, shame on him

"It is, but Tyler, you're going to have to cut down on that "faggot" word, that's very, that's a bad...
"I'm not homophobic."
"I mean, I don't think you are but..."
"Faggot."
"Alright, well, since the last time we..."
"The fuck is a good performance? I get on stage and I have as much fun as I can."
"I mean, you, you, it seems like you have fun. But your Twitter posts, just.. I mean, they're really random and it's ADD."
"Who doesn't have ADD..? Well, I don't."
"I mean, sometimes, you're just really out in the distance and we just want to know, what's the problem for this?"
"I wish Thebe was here."

Therapy's been sinning and niggas getting offended
They don't want to fuck with me cause I do not fuck with religion
You see, that's my decision, you fuckers don't have to listen
Here, put this middle finger in your ear (I'd rather not)
When someone gets blamed cause some white kid had aimed (What?) his AK-47
At 47 kids, I don't wanna see my name mentioned
(I don't think anyone's going to men—I don't think anyone takes you serious enough to believe you.)
College wasn't working and I wasn't working
So I was at home jerking off until my dick was hurting
But I was determined to be great, so those classes can wait
Cause the four days that I went, I wasn't learning shit (I mean, you...)
Now I'm living dreams that I wanted since eight
And can afford to get my mother something on her birthday
(I mean, you've explained to me that you were in school, but, I mean, I...)
They claim the shit I say is just wrong
Like nobody has those really dark thoughts when alone
I'm just a teenager, who admits he's suicide prone
My life is doing pretty good, so that date is postponed for now
Wow, life's a cute bitch full of estrogen
And when she gives you lemons, nigga, throw 'em at pedestrians
(So, what are you saying, take advantage?
I mean, you've been doing pretty good, I've seen that)
I still live in my grandma's house
Sell out a fucking show in London just to end up on couches
I hate my fucking life, but when I make that announcement
My hero calls my phone, just to put that in doubt then
And then I am confused if I want in or just out
My friends really think I'm playing when I say I need counseling
I sit in grandmother's living room and just pout
And shout loud inside, sometimes I just want to die (No, you don't)
Odd Future came from the bottom
And it's gonna take a couple armed armies tryna stop 'em
(I believe you) All you fucking lames don't have to like me
The devil doesn't wear Prada, I'm clearly in a fucking white tee

Whoa, umm, alright, uh, so Syd was telling me you went to New York...
Part 1 - FUCKING YOUNG

Day that I met you girl
I knew that it was something special
But I couldn't put my finger on it (Fuck I can't sing, whatever look)
We met through mutual friends (Mutual friends)
And this is where the story and confusion begin
Cause I was at nirvana but I had to pretend that I wasn't

There go the police man (Knocking at my door)
Do I leave out the back and (Grab my wallet and coat)
Or do I answer real confused like ("I don't know")
Now me and she held hands (And we danced, nothing more)
She kissed my hand a couple times, (FaceTime when we're bored)
There's nobody at the door, (Man, I'm so paranoid)
Fuck, 'cause

Cause girl you're perfect, but you're too fucking young (for me)
And when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young
This is more than a crush, I just might be in love

A six year (Difference) is a ten year (Sentence)
And with the (Pigment) on my skin
I don't want to be another (Statistic)
You bring me (Joy, joy, joy, joy)
And you fill a void that was once missing
And (I can say I'm in love)

There go the police man (Knocking at my door)
Do I leave out the back and (Grab my wallet and coat)
Or do I answer real confused like ("I don't know")
Now me and she held hands (And we danced, nothing more)
She kissed my hand a couple times, (FaceTime when we're bored)
There's nobody at the door, (Man I'm so paranoid)
Fuck, cause

Cause girl you're perfect, but you're too fucking young (for me)
And when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young
This is more than a crush, I just might be in love

When you're 35, I'll be 41, and when I'm 27, you'll be 21
Yo, this is dumb, and when that time comes for that 1-8
I'll probably run, cause I'm fucking terrified
Yo this is dumb,you should find someone else
I'm not the one for you, shit, I'm still growing up by myself
And mentally you're older than me and that shit doesn't help
Cause if they see you with T, they'll think T needs some help
So when you mention "hang," I'm thinking about a tree and a belt
And I don't want no relation, shit no relation
Ship when my dick is longer than my attention-
Span, it's gonna suck your shit, it's that kitchen fan
It splattered on me like my dick in my hand
What? I'm still fucking off, not good at ducking off
Because I found a goose that I like, but I'm still running off
She gon' want a nest, that's why I cannot get fucking caught
That's a scary word, you could save that shit for the birds
But I found my wings, fuck, (But you're too fucking young)
I really like you, I don't know what to do (And when temptation calls, I never pick up
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young)
Funny thing about this is, by the time you hear this
It won't even matter, I'll be in the clear, it's T and Uncle Charlie
(But you're too young, but you're too young, but you're too young)
Part 2 - PERFECT

Boy I know, that we could be more
Than just friends, but you're scared
Boy I know, that we could be more
Than just friends, but you're scared (I know)

I know that there could be
Somethin' for you and me
What's your philosophy?
You're scared, scared
And I exit and wait a while
Just say the word girl
Can't you see the answers are all there
But I'm just too blind to see
You and I are cut from different fabric
I wonder why, I wonder why, girl
Don't be too material to see
But I'm just too blind to see
Somehow, this world is such a struggle just to be
Fuck 'em all baby, it's just you and me

But you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one for me
Fuck, cause you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one for me
And it hurts, it fuckin' hurts
Cause you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one
That you're the one, for me
Cause you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one for me, yeah

I rock
I rock
I rock
Nigga had the fucking nerve to call me immature
Fuck you think I made Odd Future for?
To wear fucking suits and make good decisions?
Fuck that nigga, Wolf Gang

Who the fuck invited Mr. I Don't Give a Fuck
Who cries about his daddy in a blog because his music sucks? (I did!)
Well, you fucking up, and truthfully I had enough
And fuck rolling papers, I'm a rebel, bitch, I'm ashing blunts (Sorry)
Full of shit, like I ate that john
Come on kids, fuck that class and hit that bong
Let's buy guns and kill those kids with dads and mom
With nice homes, 41k's, and nice ass lawns
Those privileged fucks got to learn that we ain't taking no shit
Like Ellen DeGeneres clitoris is playing with dick
I'm jealous as shit, cause I ain't got no home meal to come to
So, if you do, I'm throwing fingers out screaming "fuck you"
I got ten of these Kennedy's
Not Dom, but if I was a Dahm, I would be Jeffery
'preme hat the color of a leprechaun with leprosy
I'm fucking 'bout it, 'bout it, like I'm Master P in '96
It's fucking immaculate, the way your daughter smacking dicks
Surprised she hasn't taken gymnastic dick inside her alley oop
The Golf Wang hooligans, is fucking up the school again
And showing you and yours that breaking rules is fucking cool again
I'm going harder than a midget jumping over me
Chronic youth, I'm shoving blunt wraps in bitches ovaries
Punches to the stomach where that bastard kid supposed to be
Fuck a mask, I want that ho to know it's me, ugh

Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang

It's the Wolf Gang, Golf Wang
It's the Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
Wolf Gang, triple six crew

Wolf Gang kill them

My love is gone for you mami, you could ride in hearses
I'm sick in the brain dumb bitch, can you nurse this?
You told me life would never, ever, ever get this perfect
Then you smoke a J of weed, and take his kids to the churches
Uh, fuck church, they singing and the shit ain't even worth it
In the choir, whores and liars, scumbags and the dirt, bitch
You told me God was the answer
When I ask him for shit, I get no answer, so God is the cancer
I'm stuck in triangles, looking for my angel
Kill me with a chainsaw, and let my balls dangle
Triple six is my number, you can get it off my Tumblr

Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
It's the Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
Wolf Wolf Gang, it's the Wolf Gang
It's the Wolf Gang, Golf Wang
It's the Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
Wolf Gang, triple six crew

It was hilarious, well it ain't fucking funny now
I'll push this fucking pregnant clown into a hydrant stuck in the ground
I step through the stomach, replace the baby with some fucking pounds
"My baby daddy shoot bricks, the nigga also shoot rounds"
Cause if I shoot blanks, oops, thanks
I'm right back in it dead yummy and her mildew stank

Free Earl, that's the fucking shit
And if you disagree, suck a couple pimple-covered dicks
Um, Wolf Gang, that's the fucking clique
Golf Wang kill them all nigga, triple six
Fuck 2DopeBoyz, all them niggas bitches
We don't need y'all, The Fader's who we really fucking with, bitch

And we don't fucking make horrorcore, you fucking idiots
Listen deeper than the music before you put it in a box, Wolf Gang
Papa ain't call even though he saw me on TV, it's all good (Fuck you)
But now my balls, balls deep in this broad's jaw
Swallow girl, it's just nut
Bitches scared to let me smash on they ass
Yeah, they heard I'm fuckin' nuts like the swag of a fag
Like me and Tekeli was gagging in the back of the cabin
Camp Flog Gnaw, nigga, you can tell by the badge
(Hodgy, pass me my inhaler)
I'm sick of hacking and coughing, I'm often this fucking awesome
I'm animal, Noah's arking, all from this rapping nonsense
Four stories in my home like "What the fuck's an apartment?" (nigga?)
Get shit poppin' like Peter's pores during puberty
Take bets on how quick Tyler can reach maturity
Cussing out Siri like a waitress with no patience
Oh, you want a tip bitch, well here's my dick for gratiturity, bitch

Shut 'em down!
Nigga, shut 'em down!
Shut 'em down!

I tumble-crush on huzzy sluts, give money up then nutty butt
Professor Nutty Buddy Klump gets petty when you touch his lunch
Like, what the fuck? I'm drunk as fuck, turn the fucking music up
So I can't hear these stupid fucks, talk-no-walk, let you discuss
You're talking too much, Who the fuck are you to us? Uterus
I put that on my pubes and nuts, if I don't begin moving up
I'm shooting up, you and her crew on turf, new desert
I can see the bitch in a nigga through his shirt
I can smell the whore on a bitch when she walk around my crew to flirt
It's on ya' shoulder, lose the dirt, yeah, it's the movement first
Fuck a human nurse! I'm ill I used this earth to infuse the birth
Of my scrotum on the Channel 10 news, my only motive is to
Skip to my Lou, get hip to the pew
You can drink piss and eat a dick in a few, the sickening view
Of visuals, woo, I'll eat your ribs, I'm a wolf
Then meet your kids after school, and give them drugs cause it's cool, fucker

Shut 'em down!
Nigga, shut 'em down!
Shut 'em down!

Hodgy, fuck this beat, nigga, let's smoke weed
That shit I need, be the shit that's green
A little purple and pink, come get some Swisher Sweets
About three or four more than needed be
I got a eighth I could face, I got a blunt flavored grape
I hate the grape, I could taste it when I'm inhaling the vapes
You could smell us in places when we walk in our clothing is always covered in flakes
Enough for two shake blunts; and what the fuck is this? Uh...
I think this Mary is laced; my heart is beating at paces
That Pacquiao can't relate I'm fucking faded like gradients
Shit, I'm stuck like tape that's super glued
To the center of Kelly Price first waist
It's like my first date with Mrs. Mary, the shit is scary
The paranoia from this marijuana's very heavy, I'm lifted
Fainted by my fifth hit, Lionel, pass the sherm
Let's use the Philly as a dipstick for this bath salt, you dipshit

C'mon, my nigga. You don't even smoke, you weak as fuck, my nigga. You do not smoke, no tucks, my nigga. You're as weak as.. F your butt my nigga. Oh, mark ass nigga, Cuh, oh my God, bro. Here come this weak-ass nigga, Samuel
Uh, addicts arise when I arrive
In this cracked crack fag back slab in disguise
Fat sack of knives in the passenger side
Bitch, reach for the door, get your access denied
I'm not an asshole, I just don't give a fuck a lot
The only time I do is when a bitch is screaming "Tyler, stop!"
The big bad wolf; to me, you're just a minor fox
Red Riding is getting some of this wolfly odder cock
We the niggas you scared of like bad dentists
Flow is anthemic, dirty like it's plants in it
Sick, spit a pandemic, crack and cancer mixed with cannabis
To have a bitch ready to stab a clit with some glass and shit
Your whole gang'll be diminished, bunch got the Brady's in it
Spit sick shit like my saliva got the rabies in it
Fuck rap, I'll be a landlord so I can rape the tenant's daughter
Leave my house with a new stomach, and a baby in it
Face it, me and Ace is sick like malaria carri—

"Augh! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, stop!"
"Why did you do that?"
"Say sorry, say sorry!"
"Sorry! I'm sorry as fuck!
"Say sorry!"
"I'm sorry as fuck, ow, ow!"
"Say sorry!"
"I'm sorry! Don't look at this!"
"Say sorry"

"Ow! Stop 'fore you fuck something up!"
"Say, "Sorry!"
"Say, "Sor-"
"Sorry, sorry—Uncle!"
"Aw, fuck this nigga, I like him."

Jim Carrey her to the cemetery to bury her
Listen busters, scarier when I finger fuck her
After I dig her up and then eat her out with a bit of mustard
Took karate, mommy told me "Tyler toughen up"
Rihanna haircut, somebody tell Chris Brown to fuck me up
Had to teach the bitch manners, now I gotta learn her
I'll beat the fuck out your bitch anonymous, Ike Turner
Over, sloppy seconds is my preference
Except for when I'm feeding on the flesh of a pedestrian
Nessy loch monster stop Will he though? Probably not
Silly hoes lick my balls like FIFA lollipops
Get the certain tingle, eating Haagen Dazs
With some soccer moms where they like to fucking sit and mingle
Watch an Animal Planet document on the Eagles
In the flyest '06 Supreme beanie, Sigel
Your grind's feeble, I'm regal, really, I'm Willy Smith
I am Legend, a snicker dick in a vanilly chick
Come take a stab at it faggot, I pre-ordered your casket
This is known as a classic, yeah that chapped lips crack shit
Hat is always forest so the bitches call me Gump
But compliment her tits and then its off to hump her
Fuck her in a Hummer while I rape her then I put her in a slumber
It's not a figure of speech when I tell you that I dumped her
Known narcissists, sipping on arsenic
Carved carcasses in the garage, don't park in it
Hard as finding retarded kids at Harvard
It's Wolf Gang barking keep you up like car alarms and shit
Over the edge, yeah I hide in a potato sack
Cause I'm cold as ice like Anasia when she fucking Traq
I'm the type to put you down to bring myself up
So when I rape a bitch I hold her down and get my best nut
The reincarnation of '98 Eminem
60 Crip and Grizzly and some RMK Denim
Pay attention I'm stabbing your women friends, like a gentlemen
Then dipping with the fucking pen to go sin again

Part 1 - PartyIsntOver

Uhm, I said, the party isn't over
We could still dance, but I don't have no rhythm
So fuck it, take a chance with me
The party isn't over, we could still dance girl
But I don't have no rhythm

Part 2 - Campfire

Yeah, uhm
All I needed was a stick, grab the marshmallows
Motherfuckers getting lynched and burned
I earned it, my Flog Gnaw badge is looking good
On this brand new jacket
The donuts on the flag waving over the cabin
Now grab them graham crackers and pass them over here
Hurry, quickly I need a piece of Hersheys
Darker than the corners of the bushes we be lurking
I centered the mellow over the graham
Heated it too long now, it's melting over my hand
Fuck it, I'll bite it, I burnt it, but I liked it
Camping with my niggas, its so fucking exciting

We're making smores by the campfire
Camp flog gnaw, golf wang summer

Sat by the fire
To witness gentle, but radical
Transformation ceased to be mindless
Create our own sweetness
At last growing the heart

Yo bring the bass back in
Yeah, hehe
Who ate all the fuckin chocolate?
Oh that's Domo fat ass, haha
Yeah
I ain't trying to go home, really
Part 3 - Bimmer

You remind me of my bimmer
A lot of trunk space, the perfect two seater
And you got a lot of drive, I’m trying to keep up
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
You remind me of my bimmer
See your ignition, baby girl I'm trying to key up
And your head lights are off, I'm trying to see 'em
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
So let me start it up and smash

Pop some Tame Impala, your man got a lame Impala
(It'll get dark outside soon)
And I'm sharing Slurpees and you ain't even begin to swallow
You’re fucking nuts, green top we coupled up
Run my fingers through em as you wax and buff my muffler
Cause I fingered you, you think the fucking ring is coming up?
(Where the street lights trail, Oooooooo)
Maybe, I don’t know, I think you’re chill
(Ride for)
Riding on my pegs, and my back against your legs
And a seatbelt is needed if I get between 'em, yeah

You remind me of my bimmer
A lot of trunk space, the perfect two seater
And you got a lot of drive, I’m trying to keep up
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
You remind me of my bimmer
See your ignition, baby girl I'm trying to key up
And your head lights are off, I'm trying to see 'em
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
So let me start it up and smash

Mmmm it’ll get dark outside, soon (My baby, ride for me)
Where the street lights trail (My baby, ride for me)
You ain’t gotta lie to kick it darling
It’s cool we’re moving slow

You remind me of my bimmer
A lot of trunk space, the perfect two seater
You got a lot of drive I’m trying to keep up
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
You remind me of my bimmer, smash
You remind me of my bimmer

Where you been, man?
Oh, I had a drop off to make real quick. Hey, have you seen Salem?
Oh she with that new dude, Wolf, or, Darnell, whatever his name is
Fuck that nigga, man. Hey you know where they went?
I seen 'em going down by the lake
What the fuck!
You good man? You need some sherm? I got some
I got a can of these baked beans too
Can we talk on the phone or something
Because when I call (you on the phone)
I hope you pick up your phone
I'd like to talk to you
I hope you answer
I hope you answer
Yeah, I hope you answer
I hope you answer
Yeah, I hope you answer
Because when I call
I hope you pick up your phone
I'd like to talk to you
I hope you answer

Hey Dad, it's me, um...
Oh, I'm Tyler, I think I'd be your son
Sorry, I called you the wrong name, see, my brain's splitting
"Dad" isn't your name, see "Faggot's" a little more fitting
Mom was only twenty when you ain't have any fucks to spare
You Nigerian fuck, now I'm stuck with this shitty facial hair
Also stuck with a beautiful home with a case of stairs
So you not being near fucking fire-started my damn career
But fuck it, I got Clancy, he gave me the chance to see
A world I wasn't supposed to, I'm stoked that I didn't know you
But sucks you ain't give a fuck and considered a sperm donor now
The fuck is an Okonma? I'm changing my shit to Haley
And I just ain't being passive, nigga
You a fucking faggot, nigga
Got a show on Monday, guess who ain't getting no passes, nigga?
But if I ever had the chance to ask this nigga
And call him...
I hope he answer

I hope you answer
I hope you answer
I hope you answer
Yeah, I hope you answer
Because when I call (When I call, baby)
I hope you pick up your phone (Please pick up)
I'd like to talk to you
(I hope you answer)

Suck my fucking dick and swallow this case of nuts
Ace hates your guts, I'm a selfish fuck
And I ain't sharing green as if I'm facing blunts
Frank is out the closet, Hodgy's an alcoholic
Syd might be bipolar, but fuck it, I couldn't call it
Supposed to be gone til November but quickly came back in August
I left two months through September to clearly remember all this
I would like to tell my grandma, but she just nostalgia
I'll call her number
But she won't answer

I hope you answer
I hope you answer
I hope you answer
Yeah, I hope you answer
'Cause when I call (When I call, baby)
I hope you pick up your phone
(I'd like to talk to you)
I hope you answer

You claim to hate my fucking guts
But say I'm on a island in Thailand and I was wilding
And, if I got stranded had to man up and hold my nuts
And hope that I could live off salt water and fucking coconuts
Phone ain't got no service -- this 3G is fucking worthless
Day is getting dark like the area's turning urban
You'll be fucking nervous like me inside of a church is
But, I'mma get in contact regardless, and
I hope you answer

That last verse was about this girl. Ha ha
Don't kill a rose
Before it could bloom
Fly, baby, fly
Out the cocoon

You don't have to hide
I can smell it in your eyes
That there's something more to say, baby
Them words
Damn, run me back, yeah

If I could, if I could
If you could
Find the words to say
Find the words to say
Find the words
In the garden
Shed
Go

Don't kill a rose
Before it could bloom
Fly, baby, fly
Out the cocoon

Ayo
Garden shed, garden shed, garden shed, garden shed
For the garden
That is where I was hidin'
That was real love I was in
Ain't no reason to pretend
Garden shed, garden shed, garden shed
Garden shed for the garçons
Them feelings that I was guardin'
Heavy on my mind
All my friends lost
They couldn't read the signs
I didn't wanna talk and tell 'em my location
And they ain't wanna walk
Truth is, since a youth kid, thought it was a phase
Thought it'd be like the phrase; "poof," gone
But, it's still goin' on
Big fan of the beige tan
Polka dot nose, how it goes
Had to keep it on the subwoofer
A couple butterflies wanna float
But I was always like, "Eh"
Barely interested, but bagged just to brag to my boys like, "Bruh"
This is a crucial subject matter
Sensitive like cookin' batter
'Til the temperature that's risin'
Steppin' on that ladder, tryna
Grab the rings of Saturn, I'ma
Planet by the time you hear this
Shit and chatter 'bout the heat
It will not fuckin' matter
Went to Six Flags, six fags came up
And said "Ayo! Can we get a pic?" I said no
And they said "Oh! It's Wolf Gang, "Yonkers", Goblin is my shit though"
Now I'm like, "fuck, I don't want to be an asshole"
So I'm sitting there posing with Travis, Devon
With a fake smile like her titties was drawing it on
So fucking annoyed 'cause I missed Goliath
'Cause some kid said I was there, then they caused a riot
Now I'm surrounded by a 25 hound of fuckers tryna get a photo
All because they noticed the top with the box logo
And them fucking ears, guarantee they didn't even hear Bastard
They bandwagon-jumped me from a pogo
I'm going fucking loco, "Hey, Tyler, can I...?"
No, bitch, don't you see me tryna buy a fucking churro?
"But Tyler, you're my hero, I used to get bullied
Until I heard "Radicals," the last part got to me
See, I used to give a fuck until my cock would bleed
Now I'm the happiest I think I'll ever ever be
My life is just like yours, no father
My momma must have forgot to stop with a popped condom
In school I was the one that was thinking outside boxes
So everybody in them would say that I got problems
So when I heard you say it, I said it back like fuck 'em
You're an inspiration to niggas like me
Not the niggas who like you just 'cause of lyrics and beats
I'm talking 'bout the niggas who don't know where they're going to be
I heard the song "Bastard" right in the moment of heat
Not in summer, but of course, I was holding a heat
Gun on the edge of my feet, I heard that first piano chord
And it drew me in like predators carrying treats
Then I said to myself, "Fuck, is he speaking to me?"
See, me and you, we go together like snare and a beat
I mean snare and a kick drum, see my forearm?
I carved OF on it this morning with a glass shard
On my green mini ramp that I built in my backyard (that's weird)
That's hard, that scar from playing air guitar
When I see you play at the Roxy (uhh)
Tyler, I love you, wanna be just like you (alright)
I think about your face and I don't even fucking try to (no homo)
Wish I had a basement meant for me to hide you
We could play Xbox and listen to "In Search Of..." and eat donuts
Over conversating 'bout what church does
Come up with weird-ass videos with roach bugs
I'm straight edge too, so no drugs on this trip
And Raquel that bitch, you should've killed that bitch
You should've took me instead (uhh, that's weird)
See, if you can't have her then he shouldn't neither
And if I can't have you then she shouldn't either
No one should see you, but me in your t-shirt
I worship you until the fucking wrinkles on my knees hurt (what the fuck)
Odd Future, Wolf Gang, Golf Wang, Flog Gnaw, free Earl mobbing
I know it seems like I'm just slobbing on your knob
But I'm just a fan and I ain't losing my fucking noggin (yeah, you are)
I ain't got a job and I went out and bought Goblin about 5 times
'Cause (Thanks for the support) I love you man (alright)
I like tie-dyed tees or just plain white tees
I like pants that's cut, I like words like "fuck"
I got your pics on my wall with the mouth cut out
Now paper cuts on my balls because your dick's in my jaw (what the fuck)
And I hit you on Twitter about 10 minutes a day
And now I'm bitter 'cause you don't even reply with a "hey" (sorry)
And my boys think I'm gay 'cause I play "VCR"
In my car all alone speakers waking up neighbors..."
All right, my nigga, calm down, it's getting weird, take this pic
So I can get on Colossus, line as slow as molasses
(Tyler, listen) No, nigga, I see you're loving my shit
And I appreciate the fact that you would suck on my dick
But I'm not gay so it's awkward, now I'm grouchy like Oscar
After spilling some shit on his newest pair of beige Dockers
"Yonkers" and "Yonkers" (I love that song) Sick of hearing about "Yonkers"
I'm grateful that it worked, I attacked and I conquered
"Yeah whatever but I had a fucking blast at that concert
I was at the Boston one, I got a t-shirt from Sagan
The one that say "Sagan Lockhart" and when you came out to "Sandwitches"
That's when my fucking boy-crush got started"

Just take this fucking picture man, shit...
When you're having fun, fun
Time flies, time flies, time flies
When you're having fun (time flies)
Out the window (it goes, goes, goes)

Boredom, boredom, boredom, boredom
Boredom, boredom, boredom, boredom
Boy, my bedroom floor is a cereal burial, I'm serious
I ate 'em all, dry boxes, bodies, yeah I caught 'em
If we're talkin' 'bout real meals, ask my stomach, he ain't saw 'em
I've been in this fuckin' room so long
My eyeballs are turning to drywall
My friends suck, fuck 'em, I'm over 'em
"Hi y'all, y'all ain't hit me all day
What the fuck is the problem? Is it me?
'Cause I'm not solved, I'm... bored."

Find some time
Find some time to do something
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Find some time
Find some time to do something
(Oh)

Bored and getting desperate as hell
(Desperate, using, texting, amusing)
Cellular not amusing and I hope someone will
Message me with some plans that are amusing as well
Cause I haven’t seen the exit of these walls since before this morning
Morning, morning, morning, morning
(Morning, ohh, what the fuck?)
Got some cars I can handle but nowhere for performance
My stomach angry and yellin', I need some food, I could order
But I hate eating solo
Need someone, we can loiter in parking lots
As sunsets at the border, yeah
Ringy dingy dong, I can't be alone
I been starting to feel like I don't know anyone
So now I'm staring at my ceiling fuckin' going
Like I have no idea where I'm going
Tick tock
(Damn, gotta get outta here)

Find some time
Find some time to do something
(Hey, can y'all help me right quick?)
Find some time

Gonna find some, find some time
Gotta find some time, find some time
Gonna find some, find some time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time

"Ride's over, we got some tickets to see s-"
Knock-knock, mothafuck it's me, Mr. Clusterfuck
What, when, where, how, like who gives a fuck
Golf Wang M-O-B, mopping niggas ante up
Ain't been this fucking sick since brain cancer ate my Granny up
Rest in peace or lie in it, life ain't got no light in it
Darker than that closet that nigga Frankie was hiding in
Open it, dope in it, Bobby where's my fucking pipe?
Dress my little dick as Ike, twenty says I hit your wife
This is life, truthfully I just want to fly some kites
Grab Salem and Slater and go around, riding bikes
Get some ice cream, Golf Wang Roscoe's for the night
To skate around and do annoying shit that older peeps despise
Nigga fuck it though, going hard as riga mo
Got a nigga dollars and a couple cracker kids at shows
Cracked a couple kids in the head with this cast
Had a blast out Europe, had a Swedish bitch licking toes
That's how it goes, designing clothes
Cats on everything, cats on everything
You think all this money will make a happy me?
But I'm 'bout as lonely as crackers that supermodels eat
Everybody's sparking but me, and I keep coughing
Can't keep calm in this spot's hot box and I'm getting nauseous
Hop in the car, ride to Saugus, and head straight to the office
Pissed off at Jasper because that's some faggot shit called "Pink Dolphin"
I roll here on a mean unicorn
Green hat, Vans, Golf top is the team uniform
Downing that Capri Sun, tighten my bandana up
Something like a lez, I'm forgetting my damn manners cause

I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy

When you're alone thoughts start coming in
Punching in that dark lock box and they start rummaging
Shit you've got to battle with, wishing they could skedaddle
But it makes your shadow say none, fun and grab the gun again
I needed to get out of the house
So I hit the Dead Sams, and we went biking it out
In a black hoodie, with an Arizona and a bag of Skittles
Just to see what all that fucking hype is about
Now everytime you see a roach you think of me, ay?
Cause everytime I see one I think what his parents would say
In court saying I ate him, I wasn't present that day
I was with Whitney smoking, sitting at the dock of the bay

I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy

Do you know how weird it is knowing I make a bunch of cheese
While my friends can't afford little pizzas from Little Caesars
And their whole goal is to roll up and smoke bowls
So I don't feel bad when they not eating
(But you still treating us, you punk bitch)
Wolf Haley got more methods than Pinkman
I'm never civil, fuck Lincoln, 'Preme out the bag it's no wrinkles
I'm okie dokie and loopy and booboo nana and caca
If you think I'm fucking koo-koo, try talking to my shrink then

"Hey..."
"Bitch."
"I'm right here."
"Yo, who's that..?"
"That's Salem, that's my girlfriend. You stay the fuck away from her alright?"

I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy
"So, you tell me that everything just isn't going well..?"
"Well, first off..."

My only problem is death
Fuck heaven, I ain't showing no religion respect
Brain damage, therapy's the only thing I regret
Talking to me is like a fucking body missing a neck
But, I'm surprised I ain't pop off my top off
Life is a bitch and my cock's soft, the Glock's cocked
My hands tremble, my finger slipped, the wall's red
Her life is fucked, she's sad now, her son is dead

I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your day dreams, that's how death seems
I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your daydreams, that's how death seems

When I was younger, I would smile a lot
I'm getting older, getting bolder, but a wiser top
Now I'm drunk driving, lap's full of Budweiser tops
Life is a movie and you're just a prop
They begged me to stop, but I listen like deaf drums
Love? I don't get none, that's why I'm so hostile to the kids that get some
My father called me to tell me he loved me—
I'd have a better chance of getting Taylor Swift to fuck me
Annoying and I'm ugly, most niggas wanna punch me
I'm surprised the fucking doctor even touched me
Feel like Humpty, you hoping that I'll fall? Fuck y'all
I'm Ace, I'm parentless, odd, kinda arrogant
Ignorant as fuck, offend people for the hell of it
Because I am the devil, fucker, get on my level
Doughnuts and keys and kick-flips, Supremes and markers
My life is Ms. Mon-unique Parker, but a little darker
I'll see you in a couple, OF

I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your day dreams, that's how death seems
I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your daydreams, that's how death seems

"Tyler, here's some water, man
You seem a little tense... how's Thebe?"

All because a nigga just don't give a fuck
Parents wanna blame me all because their kid is fucking up
But fuck that, you're a shitty parent, face it, suck it up
That's what you should've did before that nigga bust, huh
Feel like I missed my little brother growing up
Feel like my little brother missed his brother growing up
But this is Golf Wang, like he missed his family growing up
I got a little taller since the last time you seen me, bruh
Now I'm emo, so fuck it, I'm pouring up
But I never had a drink— (Sydney, Tyler's throwing up!)
My nigga Jasper said if I drink and get drunk enough
I won't feel the feelings I be feeling when I'm sobered up
But that's a fucking lie, why would he say that? I'm
As emotionally straight as Travis when he--(Tyler, calm down)
Don't look at me, I'm 6'5", about to fucking cry
About another guy, but this is Golf Wang, do or die
I finally had a family
Domo's in another state, and where the fuck is Riley?
Now you niggas wanna be nice because the labels wanna sign me
But before the co-signing and you fuckers couldn't find me?
Fuck that! I hope you die in a fiery death
One ear I got kids screaming, "O.F. is the best"
The other ear I got Tron Cat, asking where the bullets and the bombs at
So I can kill these levels of stress, shit
They say that I'm shock value
How about you hop off cock and turn volume down?
I haven't got around to telling my mom shit (why?)
Cause I don't know how to...(whoa)
All I want is her support, but no, it's the fights at home
When mommy cusses out cousin, some knifes get shown
Now she's really fuckin' pissed, so the knives get thrown
And hit her in her fucking neck, now her throat's all gone
Looking like a fucking monster from the Twilight Zone
Then they wonder why I stay at Travis' pad with a backpack
For the whole week, full of plastic-wrapped black tees
And deodorant like his house is my home
I could live with the same hat
And the same flat-screen TV watching Flapjack
And the same bacon and waffles on a nice Saturday
Where I skate with the same fucking friends that
Didn't give a fuck about fame or a name, oh
"Message from The GZA, oh, another one from Plain Pat"
Email full of emails, I never write back
Ain't kill myself yet, and I already want my life back

I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your day dreams, that's how death seems

One shot, two shots, one gun, two cops
I'm blowin' them flu shots, couldn't kill me with two top rockers
You're on the side of faggots and cock blockers
I'm on the side of bad-ass kids and the top notches
I'm Barney, dinosaur Harley of a human
Cause I'm shrooming with the bangers and the carneys
You niggas can't harm me cause y'all know that
We at the fuckin' Dirty like it's laundry (Tyler, calm down)
Nigga, get off me

(Calm down, man)
Fuck off me man, fuck (what's gotten into you?)
I don't know, it's like I'm a different person at times
Sometimes I'm fucking mad, sometimes I'm not (yeah, you...)
It's like I got a fucking voice in my head
Telling me to do all this fucked up shit, man (yeah, what's this?)
I don't fucking know, man (what's this person named then, Tyler, huh?)
He tells me to do this shit, that I don't wanna fucking do (what's his name?)
Tron Cat
Crack fucked up the world, and I wonder if they realized the damage
I mean, they come from an era who made a lot of money of that shit
I wonder if it fucked with their conscience
It fucked with me being out there, I couldn't stand it
I couldn't stand seeing people fucking themselves up like that on the shit
And that's where the money came from

48, 48, 48 states I get it in nigga

Shit is getting warmer on that corner
Gotta watch out for them 5-0 foreigners
Your mother is a goner
I warned you before you supersized my fries with that dollar
You got a daughter, shit's getting harder
The only thing you wanna bunk her was your freedom
You can't afford to get caught up but you in too deep
And the seashore ain't saw ya
You got a mother, she don't support you
But you bought her a new house cause you love her
Growing up you barely had a roof
Now you got a couple and it doesn't have a roof
I guess you’re accustomed what you’re used to
So you bought two, nigga
They coming for you, nigga
Niggas be hating I'm doing them bitches
Like Susan and Karen be doing your pockets
And running the man and he's losing his fucking mind and it’s all an illusion
Who was alludin' all of this potent
I am the reason your family is using and shooting up, it’s my fault
You can blame me, motherfucker, for killing your aunties and uncles
The hustle and hunger, all I wanted was a cheeseburger
And a little chain, tuck, didn’t realize this game fucked up some lives
“Oh, how’s mine?” -- my conscience eats it up all the time
But other than that I’m fine, I got a little money in my pocket

48, 48, 48 states I get it in nigga

Nigga, we broke as fuck
Homie got a chop shop I stole that truck
And I sold that dope
Motherfuckers hope this nigga go broke
But like my work I give no fucks, I’m sorry
She could have been a doctor, nigga, I’m sorry
Could have been an actor and won that Oscar, said, I'm sorry
I sold that soap and I killed black folk, I’m sorry
But I got a nice car, put my sister through school
While my momma all cool, I'm sorry
I'm in too deep and I can’t see the shore, I'm sorry

You get addicted to the flip, we used to call it
You get addicted to the flip, the transaction, the hustling
Even more than the money, it's just your job
You feel like it's your duty to be the man in between the man
And make this happen for that person, and to do this and do that
You become the go to guy forever and next thing you know you’re in too deep
Way too deep, scare the shit out of you
You wind up with so much work, that you'd be scared to death
It's important for us to realize man, we gotta get out of that, man
Dudes is buying choppers to shoot down people that look just like them
Dudes is buying guns to take down each other, nobody wins
Ya know what I mean?
I was 16 when we first laid eyes
Scrawny little fucker, yeah, I was that guy
And you was down for the weekend
I was down for the greetings
And you eyes the same color shit that Jasper be chiefing
Couple freckles on ya noses, roses made you blush
Gentleman I was like I wasn't tryna fuck
But it was my first offical date so I was stuck, like
It was past curfew, and we was at the Grove
And it was raining, and I had to be home
And then you grab my hand, talking about tryna get home safe or something
All I remember was your motherfucking face

I play in your hair as you rub on my ears
Then we awkwardly stare until our lips locked
Then we awkwardly stared because our lips locked
Now it's awkward in here because our lips locked
Feels like i’m floating in air
Can't believe that this dare turned into a reality when our lips locked
Man, this feels like a dream because our lips locked
You officially put my feelings inside a Ziplock bag

You gotta a nigga sprung, whenever I’m holding your hand and
Making eye contact I feel like the damn man
Cause even though I am and get round of applauses
I’m insecure and start to think that I do not stand chance
But, moments, wish that I can own it or lease it or clone it
Cause holding your fingertips is golden
I fucking love you, now treat my palms like a bowling ball and
Grip and keep holding on girl

I play in your hair as you rub on my ears
Then we awkwardly stare until our lips locked
Then we awkwardly stared because our lips locked
Now it's awkward in here because our lips locked
Feels like i’m floating in air
Can't believe that this dare turned into a reality when our lips locked
Man, this feels like a dream because our lips locked
You officially put my feelings inside a Ziplock bag

You got a nigga...Wait
Don't think this is going to work
Things got complicated and a couple feelings got hurt
I haven’t talked to you in a couple of days
I got too comfortable
And started to think that we was really a couple
But hey, (fuck you) at least there was time spent
But by the time you hear this you won't know what these rhymes meant
But when you realize, its awkward, your name still my password
So I’m always fucking reminded
You got a nigga sprung

You're my girlfriend.. you're my girl (whether you like it or not!)
You're my girl.. you're my girlfriend, you're my girl girlfriend
You're my girl, you're my girlfriend, you're my girl (Shit I know that you're my)
You're my girl, you're my girlfriend, you're my girlfriend
You're my girl.. oooo
You're my, you're my Girl
Ooooo girlfriend... girlfriend..
You're my girlfriend you're my girl girlfriend you're my girl
You're my girlfriend
Right now we got some new music only here on Golf Radio!
(God I love this sample)
We're going to dance
And exercise
And have some fun

I ain't got time for these niggas
Better throw a watch at the boy
Had my boys in this bitch, looking like a seminar
Who the fuck you talking to motherfucker?
Boy, I ain't got time for these bitches
Better throw a clock at these hoes
Have these hoes in this bitch looking for a waterhose
Who the fuck you talking to, motherfucker?
Boy, I ain't got time

Boy, I need a Kleenex
How I got this far? Boy, I can't believe it
That I got this car, so I take the scenic
Passenger a white boy, look like River Phoenix
First... happy birthday!
You bitch ass nigga, yup I'm thirsty
Them little shots that you threw, they ain't hurt me
I ain't fuck with you bitch ass in the first place

I ain't got time for these niggas
Better throw a watch at the boy
Had my boys in this bitch, looking like a seminar
Who the fuck you talking to motherfucker?
Boy, I ain't got time for these bitches
Better throw a clock at these hoes
Have these hoes in this bitch looking for a waterhose
Who the fuck you talking to, motherfucker?
Boy, I ain't got time

Nat Turner would be so proud of me
'Cause all these motherfuckers got they style from me
I bet they all looking from the crowd at me
And if I ask them, they would bow at me
But you're a house nigga, so you don't know
How that shit go, with my big lips and my big nose
And my big dick and my short hair
'Cause you already know how slow my shit grow

(Hey)
Tick tock
Tick tock
Tick tock
Tick tock

Been the man with a pickle plan, niggas know the dill
When I sell the carnival, I bet I get a 100 mil'
Next line will have 'em like "Whoa"
I've been kissing white boys since 2004
One me, two feet, three mmms
Four, five, six years ago sucked
Seven figure conversations with Converse finalized
'Cause Vans fucked up
I'ma read commas, you gon' leave comments
Saying what I shoulda did, but you ain't did nada
You ain't important
I'ma keep sporting
All smiles over here
Shout out to The Garden
(Tick tock)
(And that's a fact boy!)
And I just handle all my business like a chess board
(Tick tock, tick, tock)
And at them Golf boys?
That's my motherfucking set, boy
Hard pill to swallow like some thick soda
Walk weird 'cause my pockets look like thick Yoda
With a Skywalker, riding 'round solar
Anakin skin Sprite, and my tint cola
I'm getting neck from a broad like some big shoulders
Till I bust like that 9 in ya heat holster
Everything I say is hot, bitch I speak toaster
And the bread orthodox like I eat kosher
Shout out to (shhh) they gave a big loaf of
Green bread, got me chilling like a clean sofa
What's that thick odor?
Young Millie T
A young, focused black boy, oh silly me
(I ain't got time!)

Better talk shit
'Cause I'm either in my Cons or my Golf shit
Pants got a lil flood, nigga pipe down
I'm Lil Boosie, Lil Boosie, way I wipe down
(Boy I ain't got time!)
Yeah right now
'Cause niggas dying every day and I ain't light brown
And i-D ain't wanna give a nigga no post
So I went and did a 12-page spread in Vogue
(Nigga I ain't got time!)

Listen man, I'm that boy
All you little niggas clones
Boy I fill that void
You better kill that noise
Turn around and remap route
When they see that boy with them big ears and that gap tooth
Bitch
Tick, Tock
Tick, Tock
Tick, Tock
"Fuck... Hello"
I'm not crazy, I'm a fuck.. oh shit!
Floopy goober, motherfucker, floopy fuckin' goober
They ain't ready for what we 'bout to bring back!
They ain't ready for Tyler with the green hat!
They ain't ready for the Wang$ap, niggas!
Fuck is niggas talkin' 'bout, nigga?
We gon' die legends!

I hope you stackin', I hope you puttin' some money to the side
My nigga, and payin' your taxes (Yeah)
I hope you not incriminatin' you and your niggas
On songs if you're trappin', I hope you dressin' yourself
And not followin' niggas opinions on fashion
I hope them cars that you drivin' ain't rented
Just to get some comments on 'Gram
Oh shit, they are, because you not the man
Low self-esteem, hide it in lean (Yeah), Xan every meal
You fuckin' weak and you robbin' your plug? (Yeah)
You ain't got no plan, but I'm not here to judge
Cause apparently you're doin' your thing
(Talk your shit, Young Nigga!)
(Woo) I know they see me
Your pants got a flood, a little bit Katrina
Oh you wearin' Vans and Supreme this season?
Stop lyin' to yourself, nigga, me the reason
(Ahh! Right now nigga) Uh, right now
A little gooey with some nice sounds
This little groupie want the pipe now
Yeah, she eatin' coochie, kinda dyke now, uh
Got a new dirt bike, wow
And it match the go-kart, go SKRRT now (Talk your shit!)
I really want the La Ferrar', but shit...
Can't you lower the price down?

What the fuck right now? (Ayy, ayy)
What the fuck right now? (Ayy)
Right now, nigga! Right now, nigga!
Right now, nigga! Right now!

Cause I'm not one
When it come to a vision, they ain't got one
Rolling Stone never gave me a cover so...
Ummm... so I shot one!
I ain't do college, I said fuck them lessons
I ain't join no gang, I said fuck them weapons
Grabbed the keyboard, Clancy crossed my path
Cashed my first check and said fuck depression, nigga
Nigga what you scared for?
Everybody lean, everybody gang though
Nigga you a new slave, I'm an old one
Thanks to Ben Yang, still walk around with chains on, like
You ain't seen no shit like mine
You ain't seen no dick like mine
(Nah, pause)

What the fuck right now?

What the fuck right now? (A$AP Gang, nigga!)
What the fuck right now?
What the fuck right now?
What the fuck right now?
What the fuck right now?
(These niggas don't even understand! Goddamn, man!)

Tell you dickheads I'ma go nuts, niggas told me to grow up
So I matured to a V10, I'm in a vacant lot doin' donuts
(Skrrt, skrrt) There go my ego, Leggo my Eggo
Never sip syrup, shout my nigga Scooty
Y'all don't want beef, let us know he can eat that bread
Cause he pushin' that mayo, fuego
(OW!) Respect when you see him
Boy, last album was a musical museum
Somethin' always lost with you niggas like Liam
Neeson, boy, you better run (yeah!)
Here I come, snortin' glitter, portrait pictures
I don't run with many cause their walk is bitter
Niggas mad at T, where the tall freckled white boys at?
Cause I don't fuck with niggas
That's not my homie, that's not my woadies
That's not my team, nigga, they're benchwarmers
I am a stormer, I am a trooper
I am a Koopa, bring the losses now, you assume as I moved it
I run the business, I do not got time for niggas' opinions
They fuckin' stupid, don't need 'em, don't want 'em
I drop 'em, they're deadweight, them niggas useless
Neck heavy like mothafuckin' bad news
Thanks to Ben Baller, walkin' with a hunchback
I got a new white one that I worked hard for
So the doors on my car doin' jump jacks (riiiight)
My big bro Frankie got a Porsche (hanh?)
My little brother Taco got a Bimmer
If you see 'em around me, they eatin'
We all good, it's like FEMA, but of course

Get money, nigga! Get money!
All you funny lookin' niggas, back the fuck up!
Ayy, ayy, ayy, man

I wanted to add this
I sit in room with a to do list
Proceed to do and play acoustics, you
Sit around and look at me feelin' foolish
Rollin' up and make excuses, fuckin' losers

Fuck them niggas! Ayy man, ayy man!
Ayy I just got one mothafuckin' question
Why the fuck these niggas wanna look like me now?
Why the fuck these hoes wanna fuck a nigga like me now?
Why the fuck these niggas frontin' like niggas ain't been invented the swag they runnin' with?
Why the fuck is niggas actin' like niggas ain't the originators of this shit?
Man I tell these niggas they can die and suck a dick!
How was that? Cool?
Man, now they go (ayo)
I cut off some friends, where they go?
(Did this shit in one take, ayo)
I stick to the plan, that's the goal
(Ayy, we got that fire shit nigga)
Fuck these niggas man (run it)

Check my bankroll, ayo, 400K for vehicle
Paintjob look like ashy ankles on Django, interior look mango
Shotgun grape, he look like mayo
Golden voice on payroll, neck all gold like Kayo Corp
We aim at dorks, get out the way, yo
Keep them bucks in banks like Yayo
Swampy niggas out the bayou
Pockets flooded, y'all be dilute
Watered down, I'm Big Mac
I'm quarter pound, you chicken nugget
Fuck it, travel bag Balenciaga, 30,000 just for luggage
Financial advisor buggin', Flower Boy is buzzin'
Grammy-nominated, tell yo' cousin ain't nobody fuckin' with him

Man, now they go
I cut off some friends, where they go?
I stick to the plan, that's the goal
Fuck these niggas man, that's for sure

Uno the shoe, red with the blue
Look like a flag, what the fuck it do?
Golf be the set, no more OF
Like Ron Artest, bitch, we aim for your neck
Give a fuck about you or your respect
Yeah, that way, fuck your accolades
But I made the cut like I pack a blade
You could call me brush, I've been makin' waves
Since Ashley Banks' cousin had a fade
But that's '92, I'm '91
Watts Riot in my blood, nigga what's up
And that pussy pink like the drink in my cup
Lemonade, yeah it's Minute Maid
I been gettin' paid, pockets gainin' weight
Your bank statements on Mary Kate, but that's up to you

Man, now they go
(I ain't fuckin' with none of these niggas, man)
I cut off some friends, where they go?
(Yeah, give these niggas information nigga)
I stick to the plan, that's the goal
(Now we never fuckin' stop)
Fuck these (ayo) niggas man, that's for sure (ayo)

Tell Tim Chalamet to come get at me
Skin glowin', clear of acne
Diamonds see-through, so holographic
Red Ones look like Aidan Mackey
Spent dinero like Taxi Driver
Handmade is that thing with tires
But I rode the bike and Vill tail behind me
And he got the Cannon like he bagged Mariah
(Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew)
Yeah, we straight but if you wrinkle up the situation he will go grab the iron
And he do what I says like Simon
(No violence)
And my bitch mixed like jambalaya
Man, fuck with the fam, we in Japan
Bitch you’re a bum, see you don't understand
Yeah, I cut off some friends, "T where you been?"
Bitch I'm in Bel-Air, been lookin' for land
Need a spot in the hills, not the beach, need a pool
Just to cool it, I do need the grass, not the sand
Got enough rocks, see, check my hand
And I got crack, watch how I talk
And it's still Wolf Gang, bitch, watch how I bark
Wallace still trippin' on shit that I bought
But I really do not care the cost 'cause okra

Man, now they go
I cut off some friends
Oh I don't need the metronome bro
(Mumbling)
Wanna eat all the cheese in the store
In the the store, in the store, in the store, yeah, yeah yeah
Alright
(It's this girl)

She lives next door, to the store that I loiter at
We talk every night, she cry to me about her guy
And if we text I get pissed when I get no reply (It's this girl)
I know that she's the key to love
She is who I'm thinking of when I am beating Richard up
To mental images her face look
The closest that I got was when I'm poking her on Facebook (This girl)
Video chats are so exciting
Cause it's like she is inviting me to her world full of privacy
I'm getting gassed up, I think she's liking me
She's gullible and I just wanna take it like a pirate (It's this girl)
I see her in class
Not really, two doors down, but anytime that I pass
To take a piss in a stall, I picture us in the hall
Locking lips on the wall, her hand grabbing my dick
My left hand on her tits, ah my shit's getting hard
From thoughts of dating this bitch (It's this girl)
Her name is my passwords, fuck (This girl)

All my niggas got they bitches and stuff
But all the bitches they fuck, are known as bitches and sluts
But she's special, I know to y'all I come off as rough
But I'm the nicest to her, and I just want to concur
A relation, I want the cheesy dates at the movies
And stupid walks at the beach, and sharing straws in a cup
I never had that, so when we holding hands walking home
I look past that, the fact that she's fucking guys that I hate (This girl)
But, things are looking great, cut copy
Last time we talked she said that her relationship was rocky (Action)
Now that Mr. Fag is gone, there's no one that can stop me
From bagging her, I got these tickets to the Roxy (Girl)
Next day, metro's taking me home
I see her in the cut at Wendy's, but she's not alone
Who's that guy? Wait, why the fuck he 'bout to kiss her?
Come to find out she got back with her nigga
Damn, fuck (It's this girl)

She's so pretty
Fuck self-pity, I feel so shitty
I wanna text her in a jealous rage
But if she reply to say anything, I'ma smile, I know
What do I do with myself, sit in my room for some days
Play Xbox and piles full of wet socks? Fuck that (Girl)

My nigga ask, "Ace, what happened to such and such?"
I could slander her name, and then tell him I probably fucked
Or I could tell him the truth and just say she ain't like me much
But instead, I lie and say she moved to Nebraska

(It's this girl)
But she's not mine
Say some more, never want to talk about it
Feel a way, woah
Feel a way, woah
Feel a way, woah

Take me back to November
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the winter, cold water, cold water
Yeah, take me back to November, wassup
Can we go back to November?
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the winter, deep thoughts, deep thoughts
Naw, take me back to November, wassup

What if Clancy fuckin' me over?
What if 'Who Dat Boy' is rhetorical and this shit is over?
What if I'm hustling backwards?
What if my accountant ain't payin' my taxes?
Fillin' his pockets and IRS show up asking me questions
I couldn't answer 'cause I was too busy tryna make classics
Boy ain't got no motherfucking classics
What if my music too weird for the masses?
And I'm only known for tweets more than beats or
All my day ones turn to three, fours 'cause of track seven
Fuck, what if I get stuck?
What if I got comfortable? I gotta keep it buck fifty
What if I lost it all and ended up back in Ladera
At them shitty apartments that's across the Bank of America
Damn, I would be hurtin'
Writing all of these songs cause Wi-Fi wasn't working
Last year in total, I put out two verses
But five-seven figures since then, life's kinda perfect
Oh is it really? Oh is it really? Bitch you know the dealy
Really hilly willy tilly silly, hold that billy how I Milly Rock
When they can't relate him, when they start to hate him
They don't drive these cars so what's their ultimatum?
Tell me, what's your November? Is it a person?
Mine was the summer '06, I remember the... (horn)
What if I thought the brake was the gas? What if I crashed?
What if these deep thoughts was my last?
Let me pull over, quick!

And drive back to November
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the Winter, cold water, cold water
Yeah, take me back to November, wassup
Can we go back to November?
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the Winter, deep thoughts, deep thoughts
Naw, take me back to November, wassup

My November was those Odd Future Sundays, where we used to just skate all day
My November, and I was performing and Lil Wayne rapped with me, I think I cried that night
My November was awesome, I booked my first feature film
My November was when I was gifted this Getz and Gilberto album
My November was seeing Erykah Badu perform
My November was when my brother took me to first concert ever...
My November was summer 2015 when I fell in love with someone who fucked my whole world up, showed me life through a different
2014, Miami 43rd Street, every day was November

Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
I ain't doin' fine, lost my mothafuckin' mind
Time travel back and help me find
Take me back, take me back to November, this I know
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back to November, this I know
"My November is right now"

I wrote a song about you, I want your opinion
Opposite of my heart rate, it slows down at the ending
'Cause the love I got for you has exceeded appearance, the lyrics are
Matter of fact, I'ma just call you, so you can hear it
If you do answer, I'll play it to state facts
Although I already know the response you gon' say back
At that point I'll hang up, disappear and just stay back
And if you don't I'll leave a voicemail with the playback

Hello, no one is available to take your call
Please leave a message after the tone
*beep*
Ayo
Let's take it back to them days
Counting sheep on Sadie Hannah's floor
Carpet was my baby mama
80 dollar profit from the coffee I poured
Rent-A-Center calling everyday
Nobody home, they're knocking on the door
Now I skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
In toys I only dreamed that I could afford
Now I roll through Okaga

I ride to California
These frog oval goggles
I'm leaning out the window
OJ shining on me
Simp sun shining on me
Slick circles roll float
Out this world
Yeah, yeah

Run it, run it, run it, run it
I rock, I roll, I bloom, I grow (I grow)
I rock, I roll (What you say?), I bloom, I grow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (Let 'em know), I bloom, I grow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (One more time), I bloom, I grow
(Let's go!)

Ain't nobody fucking with T, but that just may be my ego
But don't be too cool, you might freeze
Because niggas get stuck in the cold (Man, look at this ice)
Shit weighs a ton, water your garden my nigga and stunt
(Stunt on these niggas)
Tell these black kids they could be who they are
Dye your hair blue, shit, I'll do it too
Look, I smell like Chanel
I never mall grip with my manicured nails
I coconut oil the skin
I keep the top low 'cause the follicles thinnin'
But other than that, man, it feels like I'm winning
Went from statistic to millionaire
CNN doubted 'cause my skin is dark
Then they forget when I get in my car

These frog oval goggles
I'm leaning out the window
OJ shining on me
Simp sun shining on me
Slick wheels roll float
Out this world
Yeah, yeah
Run it, run it, run it, yeah

I glow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (What you say?), I bloom, I grow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (Let 'em know), I bloom, I grow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (One more time), I bloom, I-
(Let's go!)

Flower boy T, nigga that's me
Rooted from the bottom, bloomed into a tree
Took a little while, nigga making leaves
Keep 'em in the branches so my family can eat
Favorite color green, energy is strong
Giving niggas life like birdies and the beez
Dropping them seeds, not what you want
You don't know what I keep in the trunk.... tree

Ah, shit!

Run it, run it, run it, run it
Run it
Run it
Run it
Geek, fag, stupid loser, find a rope to hang
I'm not bipolar, see I'm just known by those couple names
I wanna tell my pops but shit, he'll probably say the same
Fuck...
Hated by everyone, that's the way it seems
I don't know what's shorter, his damn temper or my self esteem
I sit in my room and I listen to tunes, I'm amused alone
Cause none of the cool kids would let me join a team
Depression's on the stalk again
My best friend's an inhaler because it will not let me cough
Whenever I am losing oxygen, bully hand around my neck
Cause he felt disrespected when I decided to talk again
I brought that on myself, see I should know my place
But not at lunchtime, see I know better then to show my face
Around them, but the day I do it'll be everywhere
When I share these feelings finally they gon' fucking care

Grab a couple friends, start a couple riots
Crash a couple-
Gather all the bullies, crush them motherfuckers
Odd Future hooligans causing up a ruckus
It's us, nigga
I said it's us, nigga

Murder, murder, m-murder the last they heard of you
Was when I... "uh" with all them burners, you
Think that I'm some punk bully bitch who ain't gon' trouble you
Well, I'm gonna burst your bubble two times if you dont mind
Umm "Who are you again?" I'm Samuel and that's Tyler
We came to get wild and style in these trench coats!
Don't start asking what's packing in these trench coats!
Just know if you start acting, I'm grabbing for these trench coats!
My step-father called me a fag
I'll show him a fag, and I'll light a fire up in his ass
And recently them assholes been fucking with me in class
So I'ma keep them muhfuckers there and make sure they pass huh
My prom date, she dismissed my offer
So I'mma  her and toss her in the principal's office
(Tyler, I'll go with you)
Oh, now you wanna conversate with me try to be my friend? (Where are my parents at?-) Don't worry, you'll probably never see them again

Grab a couple friends, start a couple riots
Crash a couple-
Gather all the bullies, crush them motherfuckers
Odd Future hooligans causing up a ruckus
It's us, nigga
I said it's us, nigga

Bum bum bum bum bum
Bum bum bum bum bum
Bum. bum. bum. burumrumrumrum bum bum bum
Bum bum bumbumbumbum, hehe
We are the Sams, and we're dead -- it's just four of us
We come in peace, we mean no harm, and we're inglorious
We took their heads but we just took back what they took from us
I guess we lost ours

Music had nothing to do with my final decision
I just really wanted somebody to come pay me attention
But nobody would listen, but stuffed animals that I had
Since I was a kid but I'm growing up so they're missing
I didn't mean to hurt anybody, I'm sorry
I wouldn't hurt a fly or consider joining the Army
I'm hardly ever angry, Roger Rabbit framed me
Momma I'm the same fucking kid that you made, see?
I don't wanna go to jail, I just wanna go home
And I want them fucking kids at school to just leave me alone
And I... I hear helicopters make a dip
I'm fucking reloaded -- I told you all that I ain't taking shit
You better back up before this Mac start to lift up
I'll pump it like my inhaler when asthma begin to act up
The difference between us and our class is tan khakis
I got 99 problems and all of them's being happy
Got all the black bitches mad cause my main bitch vanilla
She tryna get her groove back like Stella, grab the umbrella
When it comes to your perception of my shit, I'm Helen Keller
When it comes to the perfection of my shit, I know you smell the
Rectum, I'm like a chromosome, I always X 'em
Like Wolverine stepson attacking a deadly weapon
I'm opening a church to sell coke and Led Zeppelin
And fuck Mary in her ass...
Yo, I'm fucking Goldilocks up in the forest
In the three bear house eating their mothafuckin' porridge
I tell her it's my house, give her a tour
In my basement, and keep that bitch locked up in my storage
Rape her and record it, then edit it with more shit
Octopussy special effect the wet bitches be banging
And please never disrespect my set
With Canons hanging from our necks like it's a mothafuckin' circus

You little niggas better (check my French)
You getting money? Better (check my French)
What time is it, huh? (Check my French)
If you got my shit you better check my French, motherfucker
I'm making moves, (check my French)
I speak English but (check my French)
Your ho be on my penis, she (check my French)
Bitch

I guess I left my dignity up in the cupboard
Cause every girl I'm digging, when I'm digging in her pussy
I'm never using a rubber
But fuck it, I guess I got to stretch it out like it was flubber
And leave it dripping green and red like double cheese burgers
Chewing on cum like bubble gum from Hubba
This bitch knew dick like Bubba knew shrimp, yeah
Yo, I'm seventeen, already sniffing blow
I tell my friends it's asthma every time I start to itch my throat
I got a new show for MTV, "Pimp My Boat"
Because some bitch said my semen was dirty, that silly ho
The most that they can do is fine me, I'm hiding
Somewhere where Chris Stokes can't find me
Oh no Mr. Stokes, I don't like misters, no
Don't tell R. Kelly where my little sister go

You little niggas better (check my French)
You getting money? Better (check my French)
What time is it, huh? (Check my French)
If you got my shit you better check my French, motherfucker
I'm making moves, (check my French)
I speak English but (check my French)
Your ho be on my penis, she (check my French)
Bitch

Yo, you little niggas better check my French
I got all stars and you can check my bench
Left Brain, Super 3, Creator Ace
Put expressions in their music and create the face
Of the picture, punchline, figured out, ahh I get you
No, you don't, nigga, so why don't you go and figure?
You seem confused anyway, pressured enough?
You the type to do the choke when the pressure is up
The pressure is the pump and the pressure is us
Bitches having eargasms and the pleasure is us
Niggas wanna be O.F. and write letters to us
Competition's competition, yo, you better than us?
Digest what I'm saying? I don't think so
We sick shit, throw it up down in the sink, yo
These Odd niggas are beginning to spill these pink flows
We think sorta odd, so we think so

Crusing in my go-kart at Walmart selling cupcakes
Go ahead admit it, faggot, this shit is tighter than butt rape
That involve Ballpark Franks and silver duct tape
Pornos and hormones and boxes of DiGiorno
You homos is loco, you're probably drinking Cuervo
With some vatos with the door closed watching Zorro
You homos

O.F., yes
(So, are you dating anyone right now? You know, or..)
No, I'm just playing the field, just for now
(Ah, so I'm guessing she's white, since she's 'vanilla'
Hahah)
Aww shit
Three icy ass niggas from Odd Future doin' some crazy shit
By the way, we do punch bitches

Wolf Gang nigga scream that 'til they mothafuckin' show me death
Golf Wang nigga, free Earl better show some motherfuckin' respect
All this ice around my neck, all this ice around my dick
Gun to her head make your bitch massage my shoulders

My bitch suck dick like she suck dick

My bitch suck dick like she suck dick
My bitch suck dick like she suck dick

Shut up bitch, suck my dick (Suck my nuts)

Punch a bitch in her mouth just for talkin' shit
You lurkin' bitch? Well, I see that shit
Once again I gotta punch a bitch in her shit
I'm icy bitch, don't look at my wrist
Because if you do, I might blind you bitch

We didn't get your message, either because you were not speaking or because of a bad connection
Fuck
Left Brain, Wolf Haley
Golf Wang, Free Earl, uh

Goddamn I love women
Daydream about penis being in 'em
Meet them with a big grin with a Mac-10
Rope, katana, and then I skin 'em
All beige suit made out of white women
With the red lipstick, dancing to John Lennon
With the red splattered jeans made out of blue denim
They can catch me in the spot where the sun don’t shine
Bitch don’t mind me, shake your hiney
The only motherfucking Wolf here that spit venom
You’re a bad bitch with a real good kitten
And I got the appetite of them fat black women
Wolf Gang in this bitch with a bunch of rats with 'em
Lookin' like the holocaust with Supreme hats with 'em
I am tryna get Miss Piggy by the motherfucking hairs of her chinny chin chin
Umm, what’s that? The cock of a black dude
Mad cause his daughter got the swag of a vacuum (aww, fuck it)
I’ll take her to the back room dungeon, fighting and punching
And now the slut is under the fucking assumption
That I will be fucking and munching her muffin
Cunt will be bleeding, but that’s not from the time signature of the month, umm

(It’s because) I’m Dracula bitch
Don’t got a problem smacking a bitch
Kidnapping, attacking, with axes and shit
'Til I grab them throats and start smacking them shits
(It’s because) I’m Dracula bitch
Don’t got a problem smacking a bitch
Kidnapping, attacking, with axes and shits
'Til she decides to take Dracula’s dick

Goddamn I love bitches
Especially when they only suck dick and wash dishes
Cook and clean and grant my wishes
And make me and the Wolf Gang sandwitches
Transylvania crypt let's take a, tour
Bitch try getting through that black trap, door
Keep yelling and working them vocal chords
And that’ll be more of a reason that you'll get slapped up, for
Is that Ford trunk's comfy? (Fuck you!)
Fuck me? No, fuck Buffy
That little bitch keeps trying to hunt me
Jumping over gates, what the fuck she want from me?
She keeps sending me garlic
How many times I gotta tell her I’m allergic
(I like your cape) Oh this Bathing Ape cape?
Bitch, I got it for a bargain at the neighborhood Target
Fangs are sharp and I hope you know
That all I really want from you is that throat
I can’t eat pussy cause I might leave cuts
Then there’s blood on my sheets, but that might be a plus
On the channel, a fucking animal, leaking like pairs of candles
Bitch, is it hard to handle?
I don’t want a bride, I just want bone marrow

(It’s because) I’m Dracula bitch
Don’t got a problem smacking a bitch
Kidnapping, attacking, with axes and shit
'Til I grab them throats and start smacking them shits
(It’s because) I’m Dracula bitch
Don’t got a problem smacking a bitch
Kidnapping, attacking, with axes and shits
'Til she decides to take Dracula’s dick

Bite her in her fucking neck, bite her in her fucking neck
Bottom of the fucking lake, bottom of the fucking lake
Call my gang of wolves and bats, call my gang of wolves and bats
It’s a full moon tonight, and these hoes ain’t acting right
It’s because I’m Dracula bitch, (swag, swag, swag)
It's because; Left Brain, Wolf Haley, Free Earl, Golf Wang...
How many cars can I buy 'til I run out of drive?
How much drive can I have 'til I run out of road?
How much road can they pave 'til I run out of land?
How much land can there be until I run in the ocean?
You niggas go with the motions and all the plans
Sea I was never into the beaches and all the sands
See, I was in the woods with flowers, rainbows and posies
Falling outta my pocket, but ya'll want to know if I swam to cool down
How much cooler can I get until I run out of fans?
How many fans can I have until they turn on the AC?
If the AC blows, well then I'm TNT, I'm gone

I'm gone and I'm finished
And I ain't seen my friends in a minute
Guessing nothing lasts forever
Yeah, nothing lasts forever
Nothing sticks together
Sick of sitting in doubt
Please let me figure this out

Shout out to the girls that I lead on
For occasional head and always keeping my bed warm
And trying their hardest to keep my head on straight
And keeping me up enough 'til I had thought I was airborne
How many raps can I write 'til I get me a chain?
How many chains can I wear 'til I'm considered a slave?
How many slaves can it be 'til Nat Turner arise?
How many riots can it be 'til them Black lives matter?
Niggas click clack splatter, pew, pew that nigga
Life a game of basketball, you better shoot that nigga
'Cause if that cop got trigger, he better pull
'Cause when I get pulled over, I usually play it cool
'Cause I know what I'm driving is usually paid in full
And my ego and possessions, will not let me be one
Because I got a mansion, my mansion got some rooms
Them rooms got some windows and my windows got some views
Them views get some stares and my backyard does too
And if you walk to the bottom you'll prolly see a pool
You better not drown, keep them ten toes up
'Cause if those ten toes down, that mean that you fucked up
And that's what I swim in

And if I drown and don't come back
Who's gonna know? (Maybe then I'll know)
And if I crash and don't come back
Who's gonna know? (Maybe then I'll know)
And if I fall and don't come back
Who's gonna know? (Maybe then I'll know)
I'm wondering if I don't come back
Maybe then I'll know
"Tyler, you... obviously have some fucking problems...
And, this is... this is the end of this session, let's... anything else you've gotta say?"

Mom is getting jealous, I see my manager more
Than I see her before I go on tour and it hurts
I miss the days when this was fun, but now it turned into work
And getting legal, so I got to watch the shit that I blurt out (As you should, that shit's outrageous...)
My friends are turning into opposites
Because my life is turning into opposite of sloppy wrist
And all the bitches who forgot about me want to ride my dick
Harder than the white kids who copy shit
Ending it is all I fucking think about, that's the shit I think about
All alone, bawling 'til my motherfucking eyes bleed
See, he's a leader in person and smile, shit gets disgursting
When there's no person around, talking discussion shit, man, fuck
(I'm here to talk to you) I'm putting myself at a distance
For instance, my best friend is now my fucking assistant (Who, Travis?)
Niggas saying "Free Earl" without even knowin' him
See, they're missing a new album, I'm missing my only friend

You have everyone around you, with... thirty names a day?
I don't see what it is? I mean, you--not like you don't have anyone to talk to...
I'm here for you, I'm your friend
When I say Odd, y'all say Future
Odd... Uh-uh, nah, that shit's corny as fuck, fuck!
Tyler, you're doin' good. You have a cult following, you're-
To these white kids?
Oh, my gosh

Charbroiled nigga on these dark beats
Nauseous with the Nazi but it's normal what the cops see
Awesome at his concert, but he never had a pop, see
Mommy was a living single queen with a lat ti
So while my wallets piling with symbolic colored paper
I lace her, cause she gave me such a lot at such a young age
20, why didn't she get that abortion?
Probably cause that motherfuckin embryo was morphing
Into a Grammy-winning schizophrenic fucking orphan
Oops, I mean bastard, skinny-ass disaster
Mom works hard, still working on her masters
Son lies about taking classes at community college
Just to record some bullshit he calls Bastard
Start a fuckin cult, clash his talents in a brash way
Before he even had a mustache and cash
And all I got was a fucking shitty article in Thrasher

"Alright, just calm down"
"That ain’t shit, man"
"Now don’t, don’t, don’t make yourself seem guilty. That, that article was great"
"No, fuck that, nigga"
"You're beating yourself up and your living the fucking life right now, kid! When I was your age, I would have loved to be fucking doing the things that you're doing right now"
"Fuck that… fuck all this shit"
"You, you, you act like I’m not here"
"You're not"
"I'm exactly who you’re supposed to be talking to"
"You don’t fucking help me with shit
You don’t help me with shit, fuck!"
"Yeah, you get... that, that—who wouldn’t do that?"
"Fuck you! Fuck you!"
"Who wouldn’t, who wouldn't shoot their friend?"
"Old fucking fuck!"
"That’s fine, it’s not your fault"
"I killed my fucking friends... fuck!"
"I’m gonna need security in here, and, uh…"
"Fuck! I didn't fucking sign up for this shit!
I'm, I'm not fucking crazy—I'm a fucking table! I'm a fucking table!"
"Yes, come quick. He’s losing it"
"No, fuck this shit!"
"Tyler, calm down"

I'mma grab the Nina (No!) and find a nice arena
Cause I can’t even choose between Ortega or Sabrina (Get security in here.)
And I’m not even human, I’m a body shaped demon
With some semen in my sack and some problems in the back (Calm the fuck down!)
And a life that’s fill with crap, and a finger filled with hate
And a gat that’s filled with love, now let opposites attract
I can finally be one (No!) like a marriage in a church
But this marriage has a hearse and the parents of the one
That’s getting married has a curse and it’s made up inside of him
Too late to reimburse but, wait, it gets worse!
All the guests that’s in the church all decided to disperse (Tyler...)
So there was nobody who could stop the wedding with converse (You don't want to do this...)
So they tied the knot, now it’s too late to reverse
This arrangement (Yes, it is) and the nurse is amazed
At the hurt that he was painting (Calm the fuck down!)
But it was obvious in all the photos he was paining
Now a bunch of whispering immerse

"Yeah, he's right there. Security's right there."
"Shit! No, get away from me."
"Get him."
And then the nurse blurts
("Come here.")
"What the fuck is his problem? Here, we have two doses to give him, here"
Why didn’t anybody ask him first?
("Get on the ground!") "Hold him down."
"I’ve been asking you this whole time, Tyler..."
"Get the fuck away from me! Get away from me!" ("Come here, motherfucker!")
Because nobody gave a fuck
"Get the fuck off of me..."
Someone gave a fuck Tyler
And, uh... the person that gave a fuck was me
See, you’re not, going crazy... it’s me. I’m your best friend, Tyler
I know everything, I know everything about you
You’ve been helping yourself this whole time. Your friends? They’re just figments of your imagination
Dr. TC... See Tyler, I’m your conscience
I’m Tron Cat, I’m Ace, I’m Wolf Haley, I’m... (Me)
Tyler we ah, I know it's short notice but I brought all your friends here
For some reason I couldn't get a hold of Taco and Jasper
But, I just brought all your friends to talk to you
Because, they're really worried about you
I thought it would be better if, they could talk to you

It was all a dream, I used to read Complex magazines
When I rhyme I'm tryna get pictures in High Times
Smoke trees and see my dreams hanging in the sky line
Swanton bomb off the bed into a fine dime
In my mind I'm just tryna smoke the finest
And get high sticking bad heinas in vaginas
I'm the flyest when it come to this, fire when I come to spit
I am getting higher when the lighter comes in front of this
I'm a stoner yeah, yeah, yeah you get the picture now
30 thousand feet gon' make it hard for me to simmer down
Another flight, another beat, another city, wow
Thus another couple bitches crying when I kick 'em out
Where we at? We on top of the world

And five minutes from suicide, I biked it to the park
I walked onto the block, met a guy, burgundy 'Preme snap-back
Hurling himself at cars, and flirting with blonde Cadillacs
All was gray, all was gray, Frankie had the blues in fact
Bunch of pale hipster girls, pretty, but they booty flat
Teenage males, couldn't tell I was going through it
Had a wallet full of cream, Amex Green, Beamer almost black
Parked in front the studio Bastard's recorded at
Earl, Gilbert, Tyler, Hodgy, Domo, Left, Taco, Nakel
Sydney, Lionel, Juan, Michael, Jasper, Hal and Matt
Bet I'm missing several but I had to bring that pattern back
We live inside a house that says fuck 'em on the welcome mat
Deep inside the ear canals of Bill O'Reilly's daughter that's
Where I'm at? Now where we at? Wolf Gang, where we at?

Swell motions get promotions, to my whole team
Hell yeah I smoke weed cause I like to go green
Professor Beats educates niggas, let me proceed
Shine chandelier bright might make your nose bleeds
We at Randy's ordering that 306
Milk and glaze is the greed gold mix me
Your bitch is coming along, yeah she hum to my song
Singing like they were for her, but they were for the blur
No longer, but we were in premature, immature
She's unsure, I'm for sure, blouse and dress and my shirt
On the floor then pick it up, out the door, door
Chased, an imaginary friend, a reverie absorption
Impregnate the dream 'til it has an abortion
Where we at? We on top of the world

Everything they say I'd never have, I'm seeing
Now, I bet they see that we balling like All-Star Weekend
Always been the most cool, they chase our shade
They say life switches pace when you got shit made
So I'm just tryna get paid, don't you remember the days
When your dreams were the only thing that kept you sane
And too often they think that they could stop me
Now every show we makin' half a Maserati
And the only thing blocking me is paparazzi
Now it's gold Rolex's if they try to clock me
Everything stays in the box like fighters in hockey
Miss me if you're thinking we slack, work hard
I got the world saying every single Friday is black
Took your bitch, you ain't getting her back, cause she know
Where we at nigga? We on top of the world

Where we at, niggas?
Where the fuck we at, man? You niggas don't know me, huh
Where we at?

Down to fucking Earth, huh, down to fucking Earth, huh
Fuck everybody, here goes some extra girth Sir
You fucking critics are making my nerves hurt
Since I'm saying fuck everybody I guess that I'm a fucking pervert
My window is a book and I'm a fucking crook
Stealing phones to call home but the line is off the hook
My mom ain't paid the bill, guess I can't pay it either
I ain't signed a fucking deal yet
But when I do Clancy and Dave are taking percentages
That could pay the whole fucking city's mortgage
Hopefully I make a lot of porridge from touring in fucking Oregon
From playing piano organs and hopefully I can pay the bill
Shit is getting real, people begin to feel
Like I'm changing, but their complaining making big fucking deals
About some shit, they bitch and pout
(Can we get backstage man?) No, faggot, it's sold out
(Come on why you holding out, I though we was boys, without me
You wouldn't be Tyler the Creator, you're from the Dirty
I can tell whenever you perform, a leopard can't change it's spots)
But I'm a fucking unicorn (Whatever man)
Look, you can't stop me, I'm going full monty
Fuck that, I'm Hitler, everyone's a fucking Nazi
Wolf Gi-di-dang you be roaming where the fox be
And I be where, anybody cares
I try to preach "Fuck age, live dreams and have fun"
(Here’s some give a fuck, cake) Oh, maybe I should have some
(Asshole, have none) How can I wake up on the wrong side
Of the bed, when I don't even fucking have one?
When I'm on that stage I feel important
A whole fucking assortment of children that's taking Ritalin
Because the teacher said that the therapist wasn't feeling him
You gotta be fucking kidding me
At school I was a zero, now I'm every boy's hero and they fear it
You can hear it when that little fuck is reciting my lyrics, yeah I'm rebel nigga
Cheer it, dead parents everywhere, it's smelling like teen spirit
Okay, fuck it, Elvis has left the building
I'd tell him to eat a dick quicker than Mexicans sprint over borders
I give a fuck like a quarter with 20 cent
At Hamptons with Fred Hampton relaxing at Happy Camper
It's the fucking financial aid at Hamptons wasn't relaxing
I'm taxing, "Fuck 'em all!"'s what I'm chanting
Don't complain I'm just ranting
Fuck ranking, I'm the best, I'm the champion's chariot
I'm a liar like Carrey in Liar Liar
I'm dirtier than the sheets in the Marriott
Cable guy like Larry, Peter Pan in my youth, fucking fairies
I'm using my tooth bait to get that bitches teeth paste
Fuck it, Odd Future some Nazis, black Nazis don't copy
We perfect, you sloppy, hotter than Saki Takei
Fuck a label on my jacket, screw you like a ratchet
Screw you like a black teen on Judge Hatchett
Hang with thrashers and jackers
Drug dealers and crackers, AP students and slackers
I'm backwards like Jermaine Dupri in '93
Escaping from concentration camps with a fucking girl board and a ramp
That I ordered from CCS with some diamonds that's VVS
Like I went to Sierra Leone in a homecoming dress
With some matching pink panties, lipstick from my granny
Sup on my hat like that motherfucker friendly
White, red-headed bitch reminded me of Annie
She dino like my state of mind, so yeah she understand me
Fuck You Bunch is here, never disrespect my family
That’s for my little brother, sister, cousin and my auntie
Wasted fucking youth? All you old niggas antiques
We go skate, rape sluts and eat donuts from Randy
Bitches like Tia Landry watching Billy and Mandy
Motherfuckers wanna be Odd but you can't be
Sit the fuck down all you old niggas stand me, faggot
I guess I got to be a fucking hand-me-down rapper
From Los Angee area anytime I'm fucking landing
Fuck 2DopeBoyz and NahRight, shout out to Hype Trak
Them motherfuckers could never get rid of me
Guess I gotta do a fucking song with Dom Kennedy
Get these fucking hip hop bloggers to start feeling me
Because I'm seventeen, compose my own beats
Lyrically I'm dope enough to ass-fuck the dude who made nicotine
Maybe I should buy some Hundreds, wear some fucking skinny jeans
And follow in your footsteps like a motherfucking millipede
Centipede, make songs about Gucci and ciggaweed
Jerk with my freshmen like it's some motherfucking little league
No, I'm not no fucking hipster, mister
No, I'm not no fucking Kid Cudi, all my fucking fans love me
Collaboration hits for fans screaming fuck buddies, yo, yo
I'm driving in a stolen truck, and I'm probably fucking drunk
Wasted as fuck, can't walk it out, DJ Unk (uh!)
My nose is filled with coke and my license is revoked
(Shut the fuck up!) Who the fuck told me not to spoke?
Fuck everybody here, everybody vanished, I'm managed
Hop off my dick and make a fucking sandwich
Everybody listening can suck my dick in Spanish
Fuck you, faggot (fucking bastard)

Yeah, um, as you can probably tell from listening to this record
I was, I was probably angry, probably on my period
But um, I didn’t mean to offend anyone
Alright, I'm lying
OF
You are a whore, you are a whore
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck him
Fuck everything else I can see
I know, fuck you I hate you so fucking much
I know you think I'm crazy
Cause I think you’re a fucking fag

"Sam, the music sounds good, man! You've been practicing?"
"Thanks"
"Sam, this is Wolf. He's new here."
"Sup, dude"
"Wolf, this is Sam. Sam and his band have been here at Flog Gnaw for a while. Sam's gonna show you around while I fill out these last minute field trip slips, alright? Now you guys have fun"
"So, you guys are into jazz?"
"Look. Wolf, Prairie Dog, Ronzell—whatever the fuck your name is. We don't fuck with you or anybody else here, alright? You stay the fuck out of our way and we'll stay out of yours, capisce?"
Part 1 - Fish

Slip it in her drink, and in the blink of an eye
I can make a white girl look chink
Don't know what to think, 'cause last time I attempted this shit
The judge ordered me to see a shrink
Started with the link
Contended her to meet me at the local
Odd Future Wolf Gang skating rink
We was uniquely in sync
Already fucking and we only met last week
We were both young, not yet antique
So her mindset was working for my technique
Tell her that I love her and by next week
You can hear her shriek from the gashes in her cheeks
No, I'm not a freak, I am meekly a creep
The neighbors by the creek says my house stinks
And it reeks on the sheet, girl
Streaks of red, even though all pussy is pink
Oblivion makes obvious seeks
Which make meats for my obvious feasts
Used to just blot up thoughts, plot, and rethink
Now I get daughters and tie 'em and clink
Got my dick harder than iron and zinc
Now they just rot up, arms caught in the sink
Where they get cut up to fit my physique
Critique my chic in this brand new mink
Go

Yeah, Wolf Gang
Wolf Haley
All good?
Cool.  We cool?

Bitches running 'round, down pussy take a trip
Make her strip, got my dick harder than the unzip
Tyler swiftly slips his dick inside of Taylor Swift's slit
Round trip in that pussy, here comes a ticket
Film clips popping on that Canon
Busting Ottoman cannons, on the pill
Is he real? Gaza stripping in my living room
Wolf Gang full moon, I'm assuming mushrooms
I'm a necrolampoon, not of Charles Mansoon
This fuck is ending soon because I'm ejaculating

(Frankie, Frankie)
Now I'd like to take this time of day
To thank the Mother Earth
(Thank you Momma, thank you Momma)
Letting the sun shine down on the lake
While I fish your waters
Ooh, hide your daughters, hide your sisters
Hell, hide grandmama too (Grand, yeah)
'Cause the fisherman's raping everybody in the pool
He on the loose, yeah

Got to wash it down, all this gold is fucking bait
Wait 'til you see the semen swimming
Baby, please not half, the whole is great
Morals? Your body's near that coral reef
It was once upon a time you came home with me
Then the next chapter left you in my teeth
Fill your gills with goo
Going deeper than Pacific Ocean
This specific motion
Makes this hammerhead puke
Got to wear a wetsuit, can’t get seasick
I love when you're in fishnets, you want me to eat you
You’re fucking wet, fish
Part 2 - Boppin' Bitch

So I met this girl at the club
And I just wanted her to suck my dick
And that's 'cause (She's a boppin' bitch)
Now she's drunk and talkin' to me a lot
Until we go to another room
And that's 'cause (She's a boppin' bitch)

This little slut whore sucks cock for a little more bucks
Than them other sluts fuck for, real easy
Cause I didn't even knock on the front door, sleazy
I used the welcome mat as a cum rag
And all the Wolves fucked too, yeah she’s a cum bag
Filled with a bunch of shit I purchased at a drug store
Four more Dora-looking sluts let me explore
Until my cock got sore and started growing cold sores

Now she thinks that I like her
But all I really wanted was that mouth
And that's 'cause (She's a boppin' bitch)
Now she text messages me every day
And I don't ever hit that bitch back
And that's because (She's a boppin' bitch)

This little hoodrat started jockin at my jock strap
Until my uncircumcised penis finally unwrapped
Flapping up and down until the cack finally go splat
Now you gotta spat, spit it out until you do scat
Then you gotta sat and shit it out, bitch, fuck your feelings
You wasn’t feeling shit when you was down there kneeling
Now shut the fuck up you got another dick to deal with

Now why can't we fuck with this bitch? (She's boppin')
Wait, tell him why we can’t fuck with this bitch? (That bitch she boppin')
What is she? She a BB, what does that stand for? (She boppin')
She, what do she be doin'? (She boppin')

Now I'm at a fuckin' clinic
Cause my dick is swollen' and keeps itchin'
Nigga, I'mma kill this bitch (She's a boppin' bitch)

Where's my gun? I'mma kill this bitch
To all my niggas out there listening, that bitch (She's boppin')
And don't let her suck your dick or you'll get hurt
Me and Slater just hit a curb
Bunny hop, zoning out, listening to N.E.R.D (Star Trak)
Made a couple thousands turds spitting written verbs
Shit, now I kick it in the 'burbs

Me? I'm from the slums, niggers who push a ton
Ton of drums with foul flow, dirty mouth like kissing bums
Mama done made her one, um, a witty son
With no respect for women, so show me your titties hun
(What?) You eighteen? Me? I'm twenty-somethin'
Okay I'm twenty, but I'm soon to be twenty-one
I wild out at shows, break shit, it should be fun
Venues are like pussy with me, "Should he come?"
I'mma wax that, like the Chapstick in my backpack for my black lips
Then dip to Europe and come back with a stack of cheese
A stack of cheese for these rats, that Mac and Cheese
New 'Preme shit got me feeling flyer than a bag of bees
Fuck critics ("How's your dick?") Shit, how's your knees?
Y'all on my dick more than my index when I take a pee
I came up with ''Rella'', ain't touch a bag of weed
Shit was doper than Whitney Houston's needs
Golf Wang, that's the team to be, ay
Getting T.U., O.F., indeed
We was missing Sweatshirt, like "Where's the hooded sleeve?"
Okay, nevermind, we found him, yeah

Me and Slater just hit a curb
Bunny hop, zoning out, listening to N.E.R.D
Made a couple thousands turds spitting written verbs
Shit, now I kick it in the 'burbs

Guess I win, checks started cashing in
I stop rapping and start asking where my fucking passion is
Probably where that faggot went (Who?)
Tyler talking father problems
Shocking shit he spit to popping topics in them gossip columns
I ain't ask for this, I did it out of boredom
Thought that roach was cool, he died and pushed me into stardom
Now; Ye's, PJs, sipping leche
Chips Ahoy, boy
Listening to Cowboy, ay!
Boy, land in Melbourne and skate to Fitzroy, ay!
AUS was awes', I enjoyed, boy
Y'all niggas played as a tot's toy
Have a good day as I annoy, oi

Me and Slater just hit a curb
Bunny hop, zoning out, listening to N.E.R.D
Made a couple thousands turds spitting written verbs
Shit, now I kick it in the 'burbs

Canons with panorama views
My shoes that seen more Vans than Mexicanas
Or crackers in Alabama
G-O-to-the-L-F, this O.F
I opened up a store so I don't stress
But nigga, I (What) mosh in gardens
Jazz punk shit, playing chords, making up shit
Pardon my Dolly Partons
And I keep shartin'
Hoodies with rectangles and different colors
Niggas think I started kindergarten

My bitch is on my handle bars
(I just wanna ride my bike)
Slater, Slater, Slater, Slater
My bitch is on my handle bars
Hair blowing in the wind
Her freckles look like candy bars
Hair blowing in the wind
My bitch is on my handle bars
(I just wanna ride my bike)
Slater, Slater, Slater, Slater
My bitch is on my handle bars
Hair blowing in the wind
Her freckles look like candy bars
My cool summer never ends
(Bars, bars)
Slater, Slater, Slater, Slater

Oh my God, seriously?
Mister cool guy
You're talking to a fucking bike, loser
Ha ha, Ohh... Fuck
So, what's going on, Wolf? Talk to me, man. People worry, we hear stories about you getting into fights and all this unnecessary bullshit. What's on your mind? Talk to me, I'm here

Domo roll another one
I'm just fuckin' with you I ain't smokin' none
My squad bring terror, no intended pun (gang, nigga)
Merch booth made niggas extensive funds
Momma got the Rover with the Range
She don't ever ever gotta struggle, not again
And I put that on my dead grandmama's name (rest in peace)
Too soon

My nigga Slater, yeah that's my little pony
Little homies is repping like I been fucking with Kony
Nigga Phillip and Kobi, to my niggas that know me
Ya boy seem happy as fuck but truthfully ya boy lonely
Nigga's a target for marketing, he's an artist
Can't even walk into Target without botherin customers botherin
Asking me for a picture, can I talk to they sister?
Naw nigga, get lost, you're fucking smothering
God I wanna quit, but I can't
'Cause mother and sister can't pay the rent
Four stories with storage, I'm 21 with a mortgage
And touring's paying the bills, life is paying for thrills
Lifes' a bitch bruh but from the third floor man, she's gorgeous
A year ago I was broke, now how can I afford this?
I started off with disposables, now I have an assortment
And I'm using these negatives to develop a portrait
Now the frame is a pain in the ass to get it in
Without a scratch or stain on the glass, but that's not important
Just as long as it's printed, and I hinted it is
And when I get it I'll make sure you get a copy, bitch
Shit I'll even add a signature with the fuckin' pic-ature
I'll even tell you the film I used, and the aperture

Domo roll another one
I'm just fuckin' with you I ain't smokin' none
My squad bring terror, no intended pun (gang, nigga)
Merch booth made niggas extensive funds
Momma got the Rover with the Range
She don't ever ever gotta struggle, not again
And I put that on my dead grandmama's name... Too soon

Grandmother died, didn't cry not a tear
Not gonna lie, fucking weird no water dripped out the eye
But when I got the news, yup it left your boy stuck
'Cause when my mom dipped, she was the one that gave me a fuck
Mom calling and calling, I'm on my way to a show
I answer, she crying, saying Sadie is dying
The doc said she only had a week for us to speak
Before she deceased, cause cancer was just eating her cheeks up
Fuck, nah this is really awkward for me, bruh
I hang the phone up, and adjust my seat back
And started to think, like, "What the fuck just happened?"
I never had a death and I just seen her a week ago
Meet them at the hospital I should
In between the set of BADBADNOTGOOD
Lionel asked what happened I said it's bad bad, not good
Just take me to the Cedars-Sinai off of Oakwood
Getting there, family sitting center chair
Awkward in the lobby, it was floating in the thinning air
Getting there, need a sticker saying how I got in there, there's a room
Open up the curtain, she's just sitting there, hello
Our conversation's brief, couldn't even make eye contact when we speak
Lookin' at her you could tell all she had was weak
And I'm not talkin' days bruh, I'm talkin' 'bout her strength
I sat there 20 minutes tops, hoping it was just a fucking plea that she could cop
She died that night

Dr. TC: Oh, that's heavy man, I'm sorry for your loss
Tyler: Yeah, whatever, don't worry about it...
Dr. TC: Last time I seen Sammy, he was lookin' for you
Tyler: Fuck that nigga Samuel
Dr. TC: Uhh, have you seen him?
Tyler: Nah, but if I seen that nigga I woulda killed him
My mother warned me that some niggas ain't my right hand
To trust her, only my heart and that elder white man
His name is Clancy, I fancy him, gotta give him props
He half the reason why dealerships even let me cop
So now I'm speedin' and tryna drive away from the fact
That she was right, so I triple left, tryna double back
The streets are filled with some clues
Like how I ain't notice that? (How I ain't see that?)
Fuck it, I seen some familiar stuck in the cul-de-sac
I pull up, get out, what up? I wanna help
But what you want for some, some niggas
Really don't want for themself
Now do I stay? Do I go? That's my dilemma
And traffic is picking up, if I don't leave I'ma get stuck (skrrt)
So I speed off, we talk barely and it seems awkward
And I heard through some words that you're off it
I got too much drive, don't wanna steer off path
And crash and get distracted
But I listen to that weather man 'cause it might rain
Keep my windshield wipers prepared
Cause y'all throw so much shade
And I got jacket in trunk, but that's in the front
I also got power for both of us if you're ever in need of jump
Just let me know, my nigga

I had to switch gears on 'em
Fishtail in the rearview mirror on 'em (Skrrrrrt!)
I had to switch gears on 'em
You know, swerve, left turn, steerin' wheel on 'em
Nigga that's a pothole, watch out for the pothole
Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Look out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole

Snakes in the grass, but I walk
I got some new boots, on the back it says GOLF
So I be prepared for their bites, they're all talk
I left the condom in the grass so fuck off
Watchin' Clarence in a mansion with nobody in it
Young successful nigga, ride McLaren with no windows tinted
I drive by piggies when I'm in it 'cause it feels amazin'
The irony is I stopped eatin' bacon
Don't get it twisted, nigga, I'm still hungry, oh he lonely
All my friends talk about their hoes and tenderonies
But all I can show 'em is a couple cars and more things
That I've made in the couple past month, he's on, please
Everyone is a sheep, me, a lone wolf
Nobody gon' make a peep 'cause everyone wants some wool
Since everyone is a sheep, not everyone here is cool
Man I'd rather drown in a pool by myself
Than fuck with their fleece
See, man, T-Man fans be seesaw
Wind blows, they go, which way, who knows?
One day, "Fuck no," the next day, "Okay"
But fuck y'all, I know that T is four for four
I just want that garden and that Batmobile
Good health, success, time on earth worthwhile
Find somebody who love me and raise a couple of lizards
But my vehicle's good for now, that's in a couple of miles
Now keep it pushin', nigga

I had to switch gears on 'em
Fishtail in the rearview mirror on 'em (Skrrrrrt!)
I had to switch gears on 'em
You know, swerve, left turn, steerin' wheel on 'em
Nigga that's a pothole, watch out for the pothole
Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Look out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole

Fuck, okay, next one
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Gotta watch out for the potholes
Ooh, said watch out for the potholes
Haha
(Yeah... You feel alright?)

God, goodness gracious
I can't wait to see the look on y'all niggas faces
That boy T nuts, surprised his thoughts isn't chafing
Fuck them crackers up at Mountain Dew them niggas is racist
Cabbage was made, critic faggots was shook
So I told 'em that I'll exchange the word "faggot" with "book"
And all them "books" is pissed off and had their page in a bunch
Fuckin' attitude switched just like a "book" when it struts
But, I'm a fraud I pray to God when the six triple "book" bashin'
While me and my favorite author's lips tickle
Peter Parker pick a pack of peppers when the plot thickens
Tyler, The Creator fuckin' kill you with a popsicle
Cold blooded so we rock mittens so they won't find him
Not kiddin' keep the Tommy on me bitch, I'm Ms. Pickles
Said I seem off, last time that team talked
Sick of making niggas cabbage so I took the 'preme off
Should've bought some stock in it
(Yo it's fucked up, I get it, put a sock in it)
Not Golf when the little homies don't, wait,let's weigh my options
I bought me a mansion, and bought some attention
Ain't give none to Hopsin,and dear Boyce Watkins
Why you mad? It's the slave in me
It's facts boy I'm back like Rosa Parks least favorite seat
Videos, stage dives, popups, they watching T'
While y'all niggas watchin' the throne, the throne be watching me

If you fuck this up
There are so many fuckin' kids right now, listenin' to this guy
Get those wings flapping motherfucker!
Cause this kid's ready to fucking fly

Eenie, meenie, miney, mo, nigga nigga on the wall
Rap bars, jail bars, die or shoot a basketball
Tyler, the dark skin, arrested in Austin
Cops know who I was cause their kid said the show was Awesome

Tyler, Tyler, I swear to, I swear to fuck! If you fucking...
Do NOT fuck this up!
You have the whole world in your fucking hands

How many leaders in the house?
Well can somebody bring the mirrors out? I'm getting lonely
Likes and apologies and snaps make it obvious
That everybody on this fucking planet lackin' confidence
How many leaders in the house? (Do not fuck this up!)
Well can somebody bring the camera out so I can film me
T a great director nigga's vision must be blurry
Boy I get them epic shots like jaywalkin' in Missouri
Wait... How many leaders in the house?
Well can't somebody bring my album out so I can hear one
Pour me a drink, shit I don't know what to think
Cause all these niggas leaning like they Forest Whitaker's blink
Wait... How many leaders in the house?
See why nobody got they hands up, see that's the issue
Um, excuse me mister but can you please turn down the lights?
I don't really like all these cameras, man
And this shit just don't feel right
And I don't really wanna be rude to you, sir
But fuck you mean I can't wear my hat in here?
And you got me fucked up, if you think I care, nigga

I hope you little niggas is listening
Them Golf Boys is in this bitch like an infant
The blind niggas used to make fun of my vision
And now I pay a mortage and they stuck with tuition
So special the teacher asked if I was autistic
And now I'm making plates, you just washing the dishes
So if you don't mind, get the fuck out of my kitchen
But keep your ego here so I can butt fuck your opinion
But in the meantime brainwashing millions of minions
Leader of the new school? (Ha, I'm in my own school)
And you would never catch me in none of their fucking shin-digs
I hope you fucking niggas is angry, pissed, and offended
In Search of... did more for me than Illmatic
That's when I realized we ain't cut from the same fabric
I made my own shit, you went out and bought yours
Man I got too much drive, motherfucker, I hate traffic
La-di-da-di, I'm going harder than coming out the closet to conservative Christian fathers
When it's a lot at stake carne asada let's be honest, I'm really morphing
Named the album Cherry Bomb because Greatest Hits sounded boring
I don't like to follow the rules, she said that I must
I don't have any armpits
She wanted to talk who's in charge of this Golf shit
I said "Howdy do? How are you? I'm the sergeant"
And who I are isn't really important
My heart is as dark as a window with car tint
So hop in with your friends, gal and I'll unpark it
And I'll do donuts until the fat one is carsick
It's young T

I don't like to follow the rules
And that's just who I am
I hope you understand
And I don't really think y'all cool
So give yourself a hand
No, no, give yourself a hand
Better pose for that camera
Better pose, boy you better pose
And it's your life nigga I suppose
For the lights, for the camera, and the action
Now you're face is meltin' from the flash of the big ol' lights
Nigga you ask for this life

Welcome to death camp
Yeah, welcome to death camp
Yeah, welcome to death camp
Kissing on my bean bag
Your lips high-five my tongue
Fingers moonwalk through your hair
(For the lights, and the camera, and the action)
This is fun I can tell
I don't know if you'll handle it well
Welcome to hell camp
(Lights, and the camera, and the action)
You should be mine in a way tonight
(For the lights, and the camera, and the action)
I like my girls skinny with brains
I like my hoodies fucked with Lame
I like my friends imaginary with no names
And I make music for the fuck of it, no fame
Aim, shoot, the gun of love, round
Tried to find ammo but it's none around town
So I went Down South but I ended up North
Uptown sitting on Cloud 9's white porch
And of course, my car's off course
You're so white, my blinkers don't work
I'm trying to let the force be with you, I get you
Music is my first, but I contemplate divorce
You make a nigga sing songs nice
You make a nigga's night turn day
And you make the flowers sing say turn green yellow
It sucks that I didn't get the chance to say hello
I want to eat you out like jello
And mess with your body like the bass and the cello
And tell your mom I said hello, you want to go to prom? (Nigga hell no)
Fuck (Shit) and another one, there goes another one

Another love song about shit
And I'll be rich if I get another diss
And maybe Cupid won't miss
Another love song about shit
And I'll be rich if I get another diss
And maybe Cupid won't miss

Maybe? (No)
Maybe? (I'm sorry)
Maybe? (I got a date)
Maybe? (Where's your dad?)

I like her L-I-K-E, the only difference is she won't fuck with me
But she will fuck with that vegetable with the hairs full of X's and O's
I want to tie her body up and throw her in my basement
Keep her there, so nobody can wonder where her face went
- Tyler, what you doing?
- Shut the fuck up!
- Uh-umm..
- You gon' fuckin' love me bitch
- Uhh..
- Or I'mma fuckin' put this gun in your fuckin' head
But all I really want is a kiss on the cheek
In private, not public in the streets
And your cupcake how we eat and your toes
Cause I got a big fetish with the feet
I just want somebody I can see
You can be a gold digger, you ain't got to love me
I'm serious (I love you) I don't ask for much
Your heart literally is what I do want for lunch
Now this shit is turning to a habit
I'm the burger king, I gotta have it my way
And truthfully girl you really make my day
I would probably kill myself if you told me you was gay
And I can't even look the other way
Your aura is a magnet, my eyes a metal bag, it's attractive
L-O-L laughing, you're a gold Oscar and I'm just actin'
And I want your cinema hole, and have our kids play supporting role
Climbing up the pole, Jack and the Beanstalk, bitch it's gold
And I was in loath, I would never get over you, ever, Sarah

Another love song about shit
And I'll be rich if I get another diss
And maybe Cupid won't miss
Another love song about shit
And I'll be rich if I get another diss
And maybe Cupid won't miss

Half your body laying on my chest
The rest is in my stomach, that's including your breast
And I'ma just take another guess
Now you probably wishing that you would have said yes
Am I crazy? Maybe, but fucked up is how I been lately
Shit, I don't give a fuck, your family looking for you, wish 'em good luck
Bitch, you tried to play me like a dummy
Now you stuck up in my mothafuckin' basement all bloody
And I'm fucking your dead body, your coochie all cummy
Looking in your dead eyes, what the fuck you want from me?
What did you want from me? What did you want from me?
Part 1 - THE BROWN STAINS OF DARKEESE LATIFAH PART 6-12 (Remix)

Oh, you the motherfucking man, huh?
Oh, you be fucking bitches, counting all the bands, huh?
Oh, you be trapping out the bando selling grams, huh?
Oh, you be smoking, drinking lean, and popping Xans, huh?
You see, that's the bullshit that I don't need
I'm telling y'all niggas, y'all ain't fucking with me
See, I look in the mirror and he said, "You are the man"
And I said, "Hey man, I agree"
Rocks on rainbow, Ben's a nice fellow
Your neck reflects your personality, and mine is yellow
Boy, I hit the block, like I hate Legos

Catch me in some Vans like one of them soccer mamas
And them bitches blue like that family went to the Dodgers

Going harder than the quidditch in Harry Potter
All my shows got one black in it like Larry David
And I'm that nigga, meaning I'm two niggas, I'm schizo
Brent Lowe, my motherfucking bingo
Pink and yellow on my neck remind you of my dickhole
And I don't really fuck with you niggas, shout out to Jim Crow
Don't get offended, love being darkskinned
23 with the crib and I don't got no tenants
And I don't like sports, but the court got a tennis
Is that diamonds on your neck? Stay the fuck out my business
See, that's that Cherry Bomb, get my burr on
That's McLaren, '91 out the Chevron
Motors Flog Gnaw, Vans on, fuck your Jordans
Went from throwing up to throwing carnivals

Top Dawg, Wolf Gang, smell the cat on your tongue
Pussy boy, you fucked over, nigga, control your gums
Teeth missing, moms' won't recognize your face when it's lump
My square homie's license, double life in my trunk
Mind, power, body, and soul, we break handcuffs
Got a strike on my record, double cups, and duck
You want the life like us, you need to crip that coast
You want to steer that wheel, you want to smoke that kil'
Well, who am I?
Part 2 - SPECIAL (Hidden track, physical only)

Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker

Bitch, you couldn't reach me with a ladder and a calling card

I'm special, nigga

They used to tell me to calm down, said I have a problem

(Somebody told me...) I had a decline in the buzz
Not a shocker bruh, I had the stun gun in my bum
And when I drop shit you better have a towel and a sponge
And ask Bob bitch, I eat a ton bucket of chum
In Bikini Bottom, I am the biggest problem
This shit fishy niggas dip like we were set in Harlem
Heaters turn them into nuggets like Carmelo Anthony
We just sit and burn shit just like my fucking anthem

I'm like goals, those are something you have to stand to reach
My campaign speech elect me Commander in Chief
Respect to whoever's minor appearances cause mass hysteria
But I'm still incomparable, I'm like the face of America
I'm the ambassador from a land made of gold
I'm a fucking centerfold, I'm something to behold
I can kill a hundred shows, take one for the road
I'm results of putting persistent pressure on coals

Until the ozone leaves and the Earth is hot
Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot
The moon now working and the stars align
I stay golden, y'all thought I was out my mind
Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot
Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot

Yo, Wolf, nigga
What? Why are you running?
Sam's after you
Sam's after who?
You!
For what? What the fuck?
He found out that you and Salem been hanging out, he said he gonna kill you
Kill me? What the fuck you mean kill me?
You got a booger in your nose
What the, wait, slow down, wait, slow down, what the fuck you mean he gonna kill me?
I don't know, he just said he gonna kill you
Not if I get to him first
Hello, I'm a salesman sorta giant
I sell molly and mary and other various items
One time one guy came to where I'm residing
And I didn't invite him, so instead tried to fight him
I got violent, long story short he's not breathing
For some reason I liked it and it was really exciting
Couldn't stop the addiction, and the irony is
A couple junkies went missing and I know right where they're hiding

Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
Dope in the bag, Pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
Dope in the bag, Pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high

Task force poured into my fortress
Found some lipstick, a couple corpses
Bitches was harmed and they couldn't reach the alarm
I'm ripping sockets out like I had fucking problems with arms
They found a couple portraits on the porch
But they don't check up under the floor
It's bodies and hotties and we was raging I'm gauging a shotty
Hit so many bitches I was pimping like Scotty
I'm a bull, red, piss me off
Like that lipstick position when she kissed me
So I bit 'em off, they was too soft, I'm a Wolf
And a designer mixing skin cotton leather and wool
And most people like flying kites, riding bikes in the woods
Baking cake cause its good, I mean I would if I could
But I like playing dress up and mix match
Sorry I'mma 'fess up, you aren't getting your kids back

Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
Dope in the bag, Pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna die

What's in my trunk? White, girl
What's in my trunk? White, girl
You need a warrant, officer

You could say I kill 'em, if my product doesn't
Couple basement stairs where I drug them, down
It's pretty disgusting, finger crush your face
I'll leave you permanently blushing, blood
Nosebleed drugs, cook you in the oven
Drums
Uh, Jesus, heheh

Nigga this is my cup
Drink the cyanide up
Dope as fuck
So I would really shoot a group of guys up
Deep thought I'm often lost in (Fuck it)
Put me next to awesome
Still can't tell the difference
Just like Asians with their eyes shut
Butt fuck a couple Rots
In the Wendy's parking lot
Barking at the sight of light from my bright sparkling
Cock-a-doodle
Eatin' toaster strudel
At a nude beach in Rome
In a black Bape spaghetti strap made of Ramen noodles
My bitch is bad
Mixed with a thicky ass
Get my dicky rocky
This will end up in a sticky blast
Chrissy Brown, mask on my face, now I'm kicking ass
Life's a bitch, fuck college, mommy, I am ditching class
I rather be happy than fucking forty
So fuck the teacher's lecture I'm having Sydney record me
For the 2Dope– (They didn't like it)
Oh well
Let's get XXL to write us a fucking story

It's sitting right in my lap, I see it
Scribbled across the lines, I read it
I'm the fucking poet who knows it
You know it, you bogus
Comprehend the language
You scared of war? I'm all anxious
We got the Angus if you want beef
Now that's a burger for ya ass nigga
(Slice the onions)
Now that's a burger for ya ass nigga
(Put on the cheese)
Now that's a burger for ya ass nigga
(Where's the barbeque sauce?)
Now have that burger, eat it fast nigga

Fucking aw, get you some
Obviously intended pun
Same time it took Jason Dill to get the stitching done
Custom made, one of one
Sold out Roxy performance
Ski mask color of a pickle just to perform Sandwitches
Started back in fucking London
Cracker children wanted something
They could bump and punch a bunch of fucking faces
(Stomp 'em out)
Moshing pits to breaking arms
Zombie Circus not a carn–
Evil wolves is on the farm
And were all evil harmed
Any sheep creep
Quiet tendered sleep
Make a peep
Fucking body will go missing in a week
Roam around the city with her titties like a fucking greek
God
Bastard was the shit, explains why it never leaked
I am coming of my age with my Memphis Bleek
Shooting from the sky, the only problem is the missing beak
(Once I have my wings and my motherfucking chain)
Oh, that's the black talking in me
Let me down a couple cups of bleach

It's sitting right in my lap, I see it
Scribbled across the lines, I read it
I'm the fucking poet who knows it
You know it, you bogus
Comprehend the language
You scared of war? I'm all anxious
We got the Angus if you want beef
Now that's a burger for ya ass nigga
(Slice the onions)
Now that's a burger for ya ass nigga
(Put on the cheese)
Now that's a burger for ya ass nigga
(Where's the barbeque sauce?)
Now have that burger, eat it fast nigga

Free Earl, that's the fucking shit
And if you disagree lick a couple pimple covered clits
From some stripping lesbian dykes that fight niggas
That like to rap about those dykes that fight niggas
Alright
Enough with this shit, let's talk business
Acquire more currency, disregard bitches
Go to Shake's house and play Goblin in his kitchen
Then force him and his mom to listen to track six, then
If he doesn't like it I'll just slice his fucking dick and
Put it in the cabinet where the fucking cookies and chips is
Take a bunch of pictures, and
Post 'em on my Twitter, then
Go to Jimmy Fallon, like "Faggot, when we perfomin'?"
Then a bunch of Golf Wang niggas start stormin'
On the stage
In a rage that will scare Zack Rocha
Better get ya tanks before this wolf war's over
History repeats itself, I'm a O.F. soldier
I can grab the fireworks, and soda, all the cookies we can eat
Make you nauseous, but be cautious, this is not Dawson's Creek
We could sneak away, fuck it, you can bring an eighth
I'm not gon' smoke, but I'm just asking baby; сould you meet me by the lake?
Said bring a towel, well baby meet me by the lake
Bathing suit, it's going down, shit just meet me by the lake
We could count the shooting stars, well could you meet me by the lake?
Summer never has to end with me

I'm give it to her, she wants that summer time
I'm give it like no other cause she knows I'm hers
Damn right she's mine, we both know it
So when we separate everything fine, her phone ringin' in her purse
Damn right it's me, I'm her nigga, nigga
Come for mines in summer time, I'ma bust that trigger, nigga
Catch us Venice beachin', she wanna go shopping
Sun down after club cause she like to get it popping
Sangria on my freedmind, cause she likes to get it popping
No ecstasy for her, but she wanna get it popping
Drop topping, I measure her pleasure
Then drop in, when she get out of place I quantinize
She is my concubine, I am her porcupine
I poke her face her throat for taste, give me head like I'm on her mind
I know her analyzation, so when she try to fake
Summer time in the boat of love, meet me by the lake

I can grab the fireworks, and soda, all the cookies we could eat
Make you nauseous, but be cautious, this is not Dawson's Creek
We could sneak away, fuck it, you could bring an eighth
I'm not gon' smoke, but I'm just asking baby; сould you meet me by the lake?
Said bring a towel, well baby meet me by the lake
Bathing suit, it's going down, shit just meet me by the lake
We could count the shooting stars, well could you meet me by the lake?
Summer never has to end with me

I packed a couple sandwiches inside that basket
And brought some extra towels if anyone was asking
We should take a dip in that lake quick and then split
Then do something that's beyond what we both can imagine

Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset, grab a drink
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset, look in the sky
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset, we never have to leave
Watch the sunset (There goes the rainbow)
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset (We can stay here)
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset (All night long)
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset
Watch the sunset (There goes the rainbow)
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset (Look)
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset
Watch the sunset (Let's go to sleep)
We're here, all night, school is in session
Look, you know, the water's pretty deep, let's go to sleep
Dr. TC: So, do you party?
Tyler, the Creator: Nah, I just do ignorant hoodrat shit with me and my niggas in the fucking mall, Odd Future Wolf Gang
(Drop it)

Niggas at the fucking mall, niggas where my fucking drawers?
Think I'm happy? Think I'm sad? Bitch you fucking know my dad
He wears his pants up in his ass, touch his ass, grab his dick
You's a fag, you like that shit, O.F. is the fucking clique
I'm going off the top of the brain
Nigga don't know how to rap but I'm in the game
Fuck that shit, I don't give a fuck
I'm back up in the fucking club, niggas know I'm at the mall
Eating chips with my drawers, how you doing? How you fall?

Swag, swag, swag, swag
Swag, swag, swag, swag
Tina perm your fucking weave
Tina perm your fucking weave

Eat my ass, lick my balls

I don't know my fucking dad, what is this a fucking purse?
I ain't fucking Mexican, but we can have sex again
With your sister with no rubber (Alexis' real name is Alex)
What the fuck? That's your fucking brother? I ain't with that jerkin' shit
Unless it's Steve Harvey's buff sister trying to jerk my dick

Swag, swag, swag, swag
Swag, swag, swag, swag
Tina perm your fucking weave

Tina perm your fucking weave

All: Swag, swag, swag
Taco: Swag, SWAG, SWAG, SWAG

Uh, oh, oh, shit, fuck, mmmm, mmmm
Wait, stop the beat
Alright, yeah, nigga, I was in the mall
With my niggas busting triggers, yeah, swag


Bitches, hoes, weaves, leather jackets (Nigga don't know)
Bitches, weaves, hoes, leather jackets
Bitches, weaves, hoes, swag (I'ma kill you and that fucking baby, bitch)
If this was a game, I already know that I would come out winner
And I'm not bragging, I'ma be in her
But this bitch really think that I'm 'bout to buy her dinner
My steak good, I got a good cut like Splinter
Juicy and hot, such a black bitch temper
Now she wanna talk and chop it up like a blender
But I don't give a fuck and or even listen like Schindler
She's cute but her forehead's big
Got stretch marks like she got four kids
Her legs can't close like the four door hinge Bronco
That O.J. killed the white whores with
A wealthy white girl without the facelift
Lure her with expensive dinners and a nice bracelet
Leave the bitch breathless, what the bitch don't know is that
I'm a mothafuckin' sellout and a rapist

Baby, you're an angel
How about we turn this into a fable of some sort?
You already know you're dead
Ironic cause your lipstick's red, of course
I stuff you in the trunk, drunk
Cause all I really wanna do is fuck and snort blow

If this was a game, I would be considered a mothafuckin' legend
And I ain't trying to gas you like Chevron
But I'm high as fuck bitch, you really need to get on my leverage
Now we're in the cabin, in the middle of (uhh)
Trying to find ways to really stuff you in my cabinet
Dreamy little bastard, I done ran outta' luck so now
It's time for a bloody foot you little rabbit
You're very attractive
And notice that my hat is always the color of cactus
And I hang with wolves cause I'm an evil bastard
Pictures of you on my wall no glue, no tape but just cum plastered
Met you at my school, departed at my house
Ended at your panties, started at your blouse
Pushed you down stairs, I took a nap up on the couch
If you wanted a date, don't come
Now you gotta make it easy for you don't run
You call this shit kids, well I call these kids cum
And you call this shit rape but I think that rape's fun
Wait, now it's about eight something
It's late and you stuck down in my base one
Come downstairs with nothing but a shoe string
Yeah bitch this date's done

Baby, you're an angel
How about we turn this into a fable of some sort?
You already know you're dead
Ironic cause your lipstick's red, of course
I stuff you in the trunk, drunk
Cause all I really wanna do is fuck and snort blow

I like my girls how I like my drugs, white
Lord, you're so pretty, lying in my arms
I just got one request, stop breathing
We can speed in my 2 seater
Girl I got a 2 seater
Speed in my 2 seater
In my 2 seater

About a hundred on Fax and it's easy to stop
You see my shit isn't stock
I used to piss in a pot and now I piss on the walls
Since I pissed off a cop, a couple tickets I have copped
But I can pay for them all
And by the model of my vehicle you know that I ball
E92, but '91 the year that Tyler was spawned
And If I crash in the woods like I'ma follow with this
Tiptronic stick or automatic you pick
Shit is static as shit, sure my shit is a M
Might get that X6 end, don't follow exit him
Might take a back street hidden
House got all sports cars like his garage is gym
Two sapphires on him neck next his precious gems
Now AMG it's in boy I will eat him Benz
New engine, you got that old shit with those deep rims
You got a warranty don't care if you scratchin rims again

We can speed in my 2 seater
Girl I got a 2 seater
Speed in my 2 seater
In my 2 seater

Sit in my passenger seat
You tell me I got too much speed
And I should slow, I should slow down
But I can't, cause you drive me wild
Girl I get a rush when we're speeding in my car
Sometimes it's too much
And you can feel the wind in my heart
Girl I get a rush when we're speeding in my car
Sometimes it's too much

I know some dudes that would find you that carry rugers
And shottas, and fucking shoot at your Honda
Then fucking zoom out in Mazdas
Them GOLF boys is bad for you like the food from McDonalds
Boy, I'm a king and I ain't lyin', boy, hakuna matata
Better watch for them hyenas if you flex then they swarm
Cashing so many checks there calling him Tyler O-Comma
I'm tryna ball like I was Domo O'Connor in '09
Probably September...
Boy I'm just rhyming these syllables, suck my genitals
Album cover looking like the mascot of the timberwolves
Skate park at Pemberton
Hoping that I ditched the chords and go pick up the pen again
Cause I kill the dark shit like I'm motherfucking Zimmerman
Turn around and lose pounds like I'm fucking Timbaland
By pounds, I mean in (beep)
Give it till he cop brick like a wall with pig in it
And money coming out the blue
Like cops are changing fits or shit I'm killin' it

Back when Left Brain had the hightop fade
And we would go skate on them concrete waves
And now I switch gears to hear the cylinders pump
The beat thump, don't get it twisted boy my board's in the trunk (Skate!)

Can you roll my window up?
The fuck you turn my music down for, man?
Can you roll my window up?
Why? Damn!
Cause it's windy!
But I love it when your hair...

Blows, when it blows, when it blows
When your hair blows
Hanging out the sunroof
I love it when your hair blows
When it blows, when it blows, when it blows
Hanging out the sunroof
I love it when your hair blows
When it blows, when it blows, when your hair blows
Hanging out the sunroof
Listening to Mac DeMarco
Hanging out the roof window
Switch to third gear turbo
Skrting on these niggas
Skrting on these bitches
Listening to Mac DeMarco
Hanging out the roof window
Switch to third gear turbo
Skrting on these niggas
Skrting on these bitches

You can say you don't want to take that drive
But your hair, it blows

You just gotta stop being scared
